like so many new americans <unk> <unk> kim came to this country on a quest
i have a dream to realize for american dream
after settling in los angeles the <unk> kim did the immigrant hustle
working all kinds of jobs he delivered laundry sold cars finally he landed a gig working in the city's <unk> apparel industry which locals call the <unk> market
i have a uncle who has ah one fabric company in korea
he always export fabric to united states
then he recommended to go to the <unk> area and get the job in fabric salesforce
so i followed his advice
his uncle's advice paid off kim worked for a decade selling fabric
then in two thousand he and his wife started a garment business of their own
they called it <unk> <unk>
and they sold
fashion basic
fashion basic
can wear anytime and anywhere
<unk> company sold a bunch of wholesale separates t-shirts sweaters little skirts and such to clothing <unk>
and all of it was made right there in l a's garment district where we visited mr kim in <unk> <unk> <unk>
i always said to my customer i have a back u s a background made in u s a is that is a brand
in the early days of <unk> <unk> when kim and his wife were still chasing their american dream they got an order from a small clothing <unk> run by another korean couple
it was called forever <unk>
kim happily supplied them with clothes until one day
ah they cut me out ah over eighteen years ago
they cut you out
yeah
why
because their business system is not a match with mine
basically here's what went down kim got a complaint from the warehouse that the sleeves on one of the <unk> tops he sold them were a <unk> too long
kim was not down with the critique
i'm not tailor i said i told him i'm not tailor
and you can guess how that went over
he told me that he cannot do business if i said like that
so i say okay let us stop the business oh that's it
had kim known that the company he was <unk> off to would grow to become one of the largest <unk> clothing brands in the world perhaps he would've fixed that <unk> <unk>
that little extra bit of sleeve cost him a slice of his american dream
for eighteen years i could not get ah any order
and i regret
did you say you regret
yeah i regret until last year
because the order was huge
a lot of folks from the korean <unk> market made a lot of money off of forever <unk>
the teen brand synonymous with three dollars <unk> nonsensical graphic <unk> and <unk> for people who will never make it to <unk>
but in the end maybe it's okay that kim didn't hitch his wagon to the clothing giant
forever <unk> rise to fast fashion dominance was <unk>
but the <unk> <unk> expansion <unk> management approach and weak e-commerce game set it up to fall hard
despite those four <unk> <unk>
i'm lauren <unk> and from american public media this is spectacular failures the show that looks cute even though <unk> always trying to jack our style
there's a neighborhood in los angeles about three miles west of downtown that is the beating heart of the city's korean community
it's got everything korean karaoke bars and korean barbecue joints <unk> tea shops and banks
um there's also like beauty treatment beauty makeup the <unk>
i mean you do have amazing skin
so
i i accept though i'm not sure of it
i came to get a tour of the neighborhood from <unk> im
she's a leader in the korean community here
she runs faith and community empowerment which is a local non-profit
come this way
this neighborhood is by koreans for koreans
though a <unk> number of <unk> come for the aforementioned <unk> and the <unk> shops and the <unk> <unk>
so it's really for us it's kind of like the ah political social headquarters or center for our community
and also <unk> l a in essence is the <unk> for korean america u s a
los angeles has the largest korean community of any city in the u s
but because of language and cultural barriers im says her community has often felt isolated
this neighborhood though is a <unk>
but in essence like as a korean american knowing there's <unk> um and all the people that i've been able to meet because this space allows our communities to come together and to be visible um i don't feel alone
i wanted to better understand how this place with its <unk> korean churches and its <unk> k beauty <unk> <unk> one of the largest <unk> brands in the world
after the u s and korea established official diplomatic ties in eighteen <unk> the first wave of korean immigration began to roll in
first to hawaii then to los angeles
it was followed by a second surge after the korean war
the watts riots of nineteen <unk> pushed a lot of koreans to the l a suburbs
but the number of new arrivals to the city from south korea continued to grow thanks to a loosening of immigration laws
by the time im arrived in the u s in nineteen <unk> the community was already on the way up
thanks to some <unk> by a few local korean businessmen <unk> got its own official blue neighborhood signs in nineteen eighty
so there was kind of that signage
oh although already there was the church and the grocery stores you know started to anchor the rest of the community right um and the restaurants so
just after <unk> became legit a couple named do won and jin <unk> chang <unk> from seoul
they came in search of the same thing our pal <unk> <unk> kim was after the american dream
in south korea mr chang ran a coffee and juice delivery business
mrs chang was a <unk> when they moved to l a they took a series of menial jobs to make ends meet
mr chang has talked about how he worked as a gas station attendant
he did <unk> work
that's <unk> <unk> she's a business reporter at the new york times
and the legend has it that he was working at a gas station and as he saw people with these really nice cars he would always ask them what they did
and he noticed the people with the nicest cars worked in the garment industry
okay now i would think that the people with the nicest cars in l a were like jack nicholson and mel gibson but what do i know
for some reason the garment trade just became fixed in mr <unk> mind so he and his wife went for it
the two of them put together their savings and they decided to open a store that was first called fashion <unk>
and they figured out what the garment manufacturing in los angeles how to deliver fashions that people wanted and to come up with a way of selling clothes that churned through styles made an exciting environment
and really created the type of place where you had to come in to see what was new
now this might not seem very revolutionary
especially today when consumers can get <unk> of the latest luxury fashions seemingly before the models have <unk> off the <unk>
but in the eighties that wasn't really how fashion was done
they hit on something um as happens in retail they hit upon a formula that resonated with shoppers and they quickly became a success
in nineteen <unk> the <unk> opened fashion <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the heart of the highland park neighborhood
they packed it with cheap skimpy teen clothes that they bought from l a's korean american garment manufacturers like the kind mr kim sold
i think one of the things that definitely helped them was the fact that they were in los angeles and took advantage of the other korean american garment manufacturers in that city specifically
so i think that very much was a propeller of their success
remember the <unk> market
<unk> j o b b e r <unk> market
kim explains that the <unk> market came about around thirty-five years ago with the arrival of korean immigrants from south america
he came from <unk> many of the other folks had worked in brazil in that country's massive garment industry and they all brought that experience with them to l a
they bought wholesale <unk> garments and went to work opening their own stores
ah people started to sell that merchandise
but the people come from the brazil they started the making manufacturing their own brand apparel
by the time the <unk> got to l a the korean american apparel industry was already in full swing
the couple worked with manufacturers in the <unk> market to fill up fashion <unk> with inexpensive styles that could be turned over quickly
my producer whitney and i decided to see where it all began
so we took a trip to <unk> <unk> north <unk> street and <unk> around the shop for a bit
the sign on the front of the building still reads fashion <unk> an homage to its humble roots
but it's a forever <unk> store through and through
see styles from one dollar body suits
<unk> in there for eight bucks if you want
i've got all the <unk> i need right now
well that's debatable
we pop inside and it looks pretty <unk>
like maybe it's more for adults than teens
we head to a rack of graphic <unk> and i'm kind of into them
i mean i would want one hundred percent wear that actually
bad shirt
if they have that in like a large i would totally wear that
can't stop won't stop
well it's right that's right you can't stop won't stop
alas we left <unk> no eight dollar <unk> for whitney
if the fashion <unk> store on <unk> was representative of what the <unk> business was in the early days it seems like it would have been a nice little life for them
in its first year the store pulled in seven hundred thousand dollars
and that was largely thanks to other korean immigrants
but then ah they realized how successful this business model was
and they started opening new stores
that's <unk> <unk> she's a marketing professor at <unk> university
they then changed the name to forever <unk> with the idea that they're selling clothes for anyone who wants to be trendy or fresh or just young ah more generally
this business model selling cheap trendy clothes that could be manufactured quickly and turned over frequently so the stores always felt new and fresh that was the <unk> secret weapon
today we call this approach fast fashion and lots of global brands do it h and m <unk> and <unk> to name a few
but forever <unk> perfected it
for a definition of fast fashion here's the washington post fashion critic i'm sorry the pulitzer prize-winning fashion critic robin <unk>
i mean it's generally clothing that is produced very quickly very much leaping on to a trend of the moment and not meant to last
um ah meaning the design is not meant to last or the clothing is not meant to last
both the idea is that if you want to participate in a trend and a fad and one that is most likely a fleeting fad fast fashion allows you to <unk> on to that as soon as possible
it allows you to grasp it for minimal cost
wear it a few times
savor the moment literally the moment and then move on
and fast fashion trades in <unk> says <unk>
there's this almost fear of missing out ah that if you don't go to the store as soon as the shipment arrives ah you might not be able to find that product in your size
and so it creates this sense of urgency basically in consumers to want to make them keep coming back ah to the store
that and insanely cheap prices
like clothes for under ten dollars a piece
this business model plus a manageable number of stores meant that the <unk> operation was profitable and everything was pretty decent
but the <unk> weren't interested in pretty decent
they were chasing their big bold american dream
i think that mr chang at least in this period where he started expanding into department stores
also thought that forever <unk> could be more than where college girls got a new outfit for saturday night
he thought that maybe they could be a place where the whole family could be <unk>
where you would really trust this store to provide you with a lot of the clothing for your everyday life
twelve miles from the first forever <unk> property is the beverly center a sprawling shopping mall that one <unk> told me is quote one of the most hated malls in l a
it's more than eight hundred thousand square feet of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
tucked into a corner on level eight is x x i forever which i guess is forever <unk> but make it luxury
the store occupies more than an acre of real estate and is not meant for people over a certain age
it's bright and loud and the seemingly never-ending selection of clothes is disorienting
honestly i felt like i needed a <unk> and a nap after we visited
but this was what the <unk> were after they were planting their flag with huge stores in fancy malls
this was their american dream realized
and they built it largely on top of the ashes of fallen retailers
it was really in the early two thousands that you saw them sort of burst on to the national scene and that really emerged with the acquisition of stores owned by <unk>
do you remember that retailer
<unk> was a teen clothing company with hundreds of stores and malls across the u s
in two thousand four it filed for bankruptcy
and so there's all these stores and other assets that were up for purchase and forever <unk> bid on those successfully
and with that they really expanded their store base and also became a national player in a whole new way
in two thousand five forever <unk> began a period of mind-blowing expansion
when mall chains like <unk> and sears and others were <unk> under their own weight forever <unk> was snatching up their scraps
when the global recession hit in two thousand eight the <unk> looked at it as an opportunity to push even harder
nothing like hitting the gas when your competitors are slamming into the <unk>
by <unk> forever <unk> had almost five hundred stores around the country and employed thirty-five thousand people
within just a few years after that the company had expanded to <unk> countries
so that meant that <unk> in the philippines or romania or <unk> could all rock a <unk> <unk> <unk> top or leopard <unk> lounge shorts for less than the price of a movie ticket
<unk> was forever <unk> peak
it did four point four billion dollars in sales that year
which means that they sold a <unk> lot of ten dollar <unk> and <unk> and whatever dolphin shorts are
but even though forever <unk> had grown into a <unk> business the <unk> ran it like a mom and pop operation
they owned <unk> percent of the company and had never taken on investors which meant that there was and i can't stress this enough no real board of directors they had to run decisions by
or at least not in the traditional sense
the board consisted of mr chang one of his daughters and another forever <unk> executive
they felt that they were building something of an empire they were in charge mr and mrs chang were in charge and they were going to pass this business on to their daughters
and it was only going to grow and become bigger
the fact that they owned everything also meant that there's not much publicly available information about the company
and the family's not real into talking to the press
they one hundred percent wouldn't talk to us for this story though we did reach out
what we do know is that mr chang oversaw business operations and strategy while mrs chang ran the <unk> side of things one floor below their adult daughters linda and esther served as their <unk>
they kind of oversaw their own <unk> within the forever <unk> business
mr chang had to review every single real estate contract um and was involved with the opening of every new store which at the pace that they are expanding is is a huge responsibility
mrs chang had her own hands full
overseeing thousands and thousands of styles and garments and approving each of those individually before they appeared in stores
i mean in many ways it's <unk> that these two people could have taken on this amount of responsibility especially at a company of this size
one minute they'd be overseeing new real estate purchases or clothing designs and the next minute they'd be approving expenses for business lunches or <unk>
which seems like the very definition of <unk>
no billionaire c e <unk> are approving <unk> or even what buttons or <unk> should be used on new designs
kevin <unk> was forever <unk> global communications director during the time of the <unk> rapid international expansion
he says while having your hand in every pot might not be the most efficient way to run a business it did mean that the <unk> knew what their brand was all about
well i think the one thing they understood was you know brand personality
so they knew their customer incredibly well so
you know knowing and at least i say that domestically i mean in the u s they knew who she was
um they knew what she liked
they knew you know when she wanted things
so it's like back to school it's christmas
it's it's you know or holiday it's um you know festival season which is huge obviously
while it's important to understand product and who's buying it it's equally important to understand the market you're operating it
i think the challenge with running and operating a global business is that you know <unk> change
the cultural <unk> change
so you know what the french customer wants the german customer doesn't
you know what and someone in australia is wearing well first of all they're <unk>
so you know um it's when you're shipping that product you can't ship them coats in january right
in forever <unk> race to global domination they spread themselves too thin
with nearly eight hundred stores worldwide they couldn't really manage all those physical spaces
now if you know anything about retail trends you'll know this managing millions of square feet of retail space is a mega challenge in the age of the internet
shoppers are increasingly buying online and having stuff delivered
or they're using your store simply as a pick-up location
the days of teens <unk> around a mall for the afternoon in search of the hottest new looks are over
we're going to take a quick break

in order to better understand how one of the world's biggest fast fashion brands fell apart i decided to go to the source a teen girl
eden goldblum is a <unk> high school junior who lives just outside of washington d c
she used to shop at forever <unk> a lot she said until they quote stopped being cute
they're cheap they're not in good shape they break fast and some of them are really <unk>
we're on our way to montgomery mall right outside of d c
explain explain what that means to me explain
and you'll see like a normal shirt and then you'll turn around and it says something like weird on it
that's a real disappointment
before i go into the third forever <unk> of this story i issued a challenge
each of us had to find one cute thing to buy
but after many minutes of browsing the enormous store
i don't think i can do the challenge
i don't think i can do the challenge either
because cause it's overwhelming actually
anything very cute here okay
now it makes sense that i couldn't find anything cute for me
i mean the store isn't called forever <unk>
ah but it should trouble the company that a member of its target demographic can't find anything she likes in this store the size of a <unk>
okay so basic
it's like a norm it's like a normal material
yeah
finally after some serious hunting eden landed on the one thing in the entire store she would wear
alright
you can hold onto that
alright
then it was up to me to find something i liked
i tried on a crop <unk> and that went about as well as could be expected
it's very snug around here like is it supposed to fit like this
hey guys i'm just gonna go out for a jog and then i'm gonna go to the i'm gonna go to the club afterwards
finally i landed on my item a plain black baseball cap with the words dangerous but fun written on the crown
dangerous but fun
i'm dangerous but fun
i think you should get that
do you think i should
i think you should
do you think
now i can tell you that i looked neither dangerous nor fun
but i bought the hat and eden bought the little skirt and we both fulfilled our forever <unk> challenge
great job us
are we <unk>
are we <unk>
do you feel like we're <unk>
i feel like we're <unk>
we were <unk>
i left forever <unk> fifteen dollars and fifty cents lighter and perhaps more confused than i had been before about how the <unk> business model could possibly make sense
there were hardly any shoppers in any of the stores i went to and those who were there seemed more like old millennials than gen z <unk>
i couldn't figure out what this giant store was all about
or how fast fashion is even supposed to work
i figured robin <unk> could help
in addition to reporting on the <unk> of paris and new york <unk> often writes about what fashion says about how we live now
and she thinks a lot about fast fashion and its impact on our culture aesthetically socially and environmentally
surprisingly she isn't totally down on fast fashion
i do think that fast fashion has kind of allowed everyone to have access to aesthetically thoughtful clothing
doesn't mean we're all dressing better though
notice i said to have access to it
in a way <unk> says fast fashion is kind of brilliant when it's done right
for the vast majority of people they're not going into the designer <unk>
they're going into a department store or a mass merchant
and you know those stores look at trend reports and they look at what's on the runway and part of their great ah skill in both marketing and manufacturing is being able to take those ideas and turn them around at just a rapid fire pace and get them into stores
and there isn't just one delivery that happens at the beginning of a season no no
it's a constant stream of <unk>
and when and when i say constant i mean like every two weeks for some of these places
so <unk> says that at its best fast fashion means that new stylish clothes aren't just for fancies with the cash to shop <unk> <unk>
but i'm going to let you in on a little secret
it is impossible for clothing designers to go from original idea to brand <unk> new product on the rack in two weeks
especially not at the volume that forever <unk> needed to fill all of their <unk> stores
so the company had to find some shortcuts
copying other designers ideas was part of forever <unk> business model from the beginning
susan <unk> is the founder of the fashion law institute at <unk> university and she basically invented the field of fashion law
and she'll be the first one to tell you that while forever <unk> practice of copying other designers ideas isn't a cute look it's generally totally legal
fashion is not recognized as an art form in the united states
so it doesn't get copyright protection in large part because a hundred years ago the copyright office decided that fashion no matter how fanciful was utilitarian
only a couple areas of fashion are protected from copying
we have a tiny bit of copyright protection at least since the nineteen sixties for two-dimensional elements of fashion things like fabric prints or lace designs
over on the patent side we've had historically a little bit of protection for some functional elements of fashion things like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ah and space suits or <unk> suits
ah and then at the end of the day what fashion really has to rely on is trademark protection
that is protection for the logo or label
so basically the polo pony on your chest or the giant double g on your belt buckle those are protected
the design of the shirt and belt themselves are not original prints are generally also protected
while there aren't a ton of copyright and trademark protections for fashion in the u s
forever <unk> has still found itself involved in many many many intellectual property lawsuits <unk> says they're one of the most egregious offenders in the game
<unk> <unk> <unk> anna sui diane von <unk> and gwen <unk> have all pursued legal action against forever <unk> alleging various forms of copyright infringement
many smaller brands have also claimed their prints or designs were ripped off by the <unk>
but most didn't have the resources to go against a <unk> dollar mammoth
and <unk> says fast fashion brands like forever <unk> bank on that
a certain amount of copying is is baked into the business model of every fast fashion company
the only question is how literally they're copying and how much they're changing it up
in forever <unk> case they'd often barely bother to change anything about the original design they were ripping off
and some of their fabric prints were just a straight cut and copy job
and maybe on the back end you get caught and have to pay out the occasional settlement ah or or pay some legal fees
but usually that's cheaper ah than actually hiring designers and engaging in innovative product research
copying clothing designs hasn't been forever <unk> only questionable move
in two thousand one a workers advocacy center or filed lawsuit on behalf of employees who said they were made to work insane hours for way less than minimum wage
in <unk> the u s department of labor sued the retailer for failing to pay federal minimum wage to its manufacturers and contractors
and in <unk> pop star <unk> grande slapped forever <unk> with a <unk> lawsuit
the company used a model in this ad campaign that looks an awful lot like <unk> grande
she claims they did this to confuse consumers that she had endorsed them
and that <unk> grande lookalike was me just kidding
a <unk> like forever <unk> rarely fails because of one <unk>
how did it <unk> let us count the ways
how about routine legal troubles <unk> too much expensive retail space <unk> <unk> that <unk> up their supply chain and no traditional board of directors to pump the brakes
and with retail moving more and more online forever <unk> weak e-commerce game didn't help matters
in recent years there's been one other major issue tugging at forever <unk> <unk> hem sustainability cause sustainable it ain't
i wonder is fast fashion if we're talking about sustainability like is that just as bad as it can get
well i'm i'm hesitant to say the worst but i would be <unk> to think of another realm of the fashion industry that is as bad
because fast fashion has as its fundamental purpose
quick <unk>
you know the twenty-five dollar <unk> that is a <unk> of some you know item that came down the runway
that is really meant to be used for a few months and then you know <unk> into the trash well that's gonna end up in a landfill
as opposed to say an hermes <unk> that is the price of a small car
that's not getting tossed out
that's going in a safe deposit box as insurance for the apocalypse
sustainability in fashion isn't just about buying more durable classic <unk>
the rise of online <unk> shopping as well as clothing rental startups like rent the runway means consumers are increasingly trying to buy used and own less stuff
a clothing brand that banks on <unk> is not long for this new world
by september <unk> it had all become just too much for forever <unk>
the company built by immigrants from a single <unk> in l a into a four billion dollar <unk> filed for bankruptcy
it's the end of an era
if you're a fan of forever <unk> you may have to say goodbye to a store near you
over the weekend the retailer filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy all this in hopes of <unk> the company's brand
naturally the internet was a buzz at the news
tons of youtubers raced out to forever <unk> shops to get some deals deals deals and naturally they made videos
like this one from beauty <unk> lauren <unk>
okay honestly not gonna lie i was expecting things to look different and the first one i thought it was gonna be like everything must go signs and stuff you know
i mean i feel like you can tell what i was expecting but a little bit of it seems like business is usual
so i'm like hello are the headlines like do they mean any i don't know let's go in and see if we can get some bankrupt deals or not
let's just go see what the d is
f y i she didn't actually buy anything at forever <unk>
but she did put together some looks and filmed herself wearing them the dressing room so close enough
deals are great and all
but forever <unk> former global communications director kevin <unk> said the bankruptcy news felt like a surprise gut punch even though he had already left the company
i really wasn't aware of the challenges
i mean i would hear obviously and you'd kind of think that certain markets weren't doing well and maybe we needed to kind of push or help promote in those markets
i e kind of drive more p r see how we can kind of you know um increase foot traffic but never was i aware that things were really kind of starting to um come to a halt or at least you know where bankruptcy was gonna be in the in the foreseeable future
its chapter eleven filing really leaned into the <unk> immigrant story
under the <unk> forever dreaming a roadmap to the american dream it read forever <unk> is a story about family and the american dream
in an age when retail as most americans know it is under assault forever <unk> intends to use these proceedings to remain viable and write a different ending from so many retail companies before it
the goal of these chapter eleven cases is clear emerge with a viable and feasible standalone business and keep the dream alive
as a part of its restructuring plan the company announced that it intended to streamline its retail operation pump up its e-commerce game and shut down a whole lot of stores
nearly all of its international locations and more than one hundred <unk> u s stores were on the chopping block
that's more than forty percent of their physical retail locations
but those plans were all for naught
in february a group of buyers including some of forever <unk> biggest landlords put in an offer to buy the brand for the <unk> price of <unk> million dollars
a judge approved the deal and boom
clothing retailer forever <unk> has been sold after declaring bankruptcy late last year
sale includes all of forever <unk> assets including its remaining stores
just like that the dream died
after thirty-five years control of forever <unk> slipped through the chang family's hands
while the <unk> are no longer billionaires it's impossible to say they didn't reach some type of american dream
their aspirations of upward mobility clout and prestige were realized a thousand times over
their children achieved ivy league <unk> and never wanted for anything
their distinctive yellow shopping bags were ubiquitous in malls around the world
they truly made it
perhaps we can even say that bankruptcy is part of that american dream
the part that lets people pull themselves up off the ground dust off their <unk> <unk> <unk> and try again

aha greetings class and welcome to counting school where what you learn really counts
so we want to start today with a little story about an old friend from sesame street
i am your teacher the count you know why they call me the count
because you love to count things
i love the count ah and ken <unk> knows him really well because he's head writer at sesame street
his whole identity is wrapped up in being the count and being a guy who knows his numbers really well
now of course for the count that we all know and love numbers give him nothing but joy
nine nine sandwiches all together
but on this one day it's different
the count makes a mistake and he's sort of cannot believe it he's crushed
what number did he forget
well somebody interrupted him it's really not his fault he he was counting sandwiches he was really being helpful
nine sandwiches are you sure count
oh but of course i am sure chris i am the count
aha
ah the count
<unk> thinks the count made a little mistake
ah a mistake
ah huh yeah see
it really struck him to his his core he decided he wasn't gonna be the count anymore
wow so the count screws up he makes a mistake
yeah and he couldn't get over it
and you know what cory that means he's pretty similar to you and me
yeah because math anxiety is a real thing
estimates range up to <unk> percent of american adults that's a lot cory
yeah i don't even need to know any math to know that that is a lot
yeah <unk> percent of american adults feel some degree of anxiety that is specific to math
so if you avoid doing your budget or investing well we got a life kit for that
yeah
but also math anxiety could be part of the reason why
oh what should <unk> and the count do next the count
nothing
ah
<unk> zero <unk> i shall never count again
what
and the <unk> not alone on tests math anxiety can cause students to perform as though they were a whole year behind in school
yeah obviously this is a real problem for schools and for how we teach math but what can we as parents do to shape our kids attitude towards math
we sat down with <unk> <unk>
math is everywhere
she's a senior vice president of curriculum and content at sesame workshop and i put the problem to her this way
i feel like as a parent i understand pretty well how to promote early literacy
reading bedtime stories supposed to be singing the alphabet song
but when i think about the equivalent on the math side of things i just draw a blank
and i want you guys to help me fill in that blank what does it mean to promote the love of math early on
you're saying that we have to get them to love math they already love math
what
yes they're not coming into this world not liking math
so let's figure out if we can solve this little math equation here
you're listening to n p <unk> life kit for parenting with sesame workshop i'm anya <unk> i'm not afraid of a corny joke
i'm cory turner and after the break we're gonna give you some tips that you can use starting in the early years
but also strategies you can keep returning to even when you're a grown up and no matter how old your kids are as well as what to never ever say to your kids about math

you're listening to life kit for parenting with sesame workshop in this episode we're gonna do the equivalent of flipping to the back of the book to look right at the answers
yep
because we know that by listening to this math episode you had to overcome some anxieties i bet of your own
yes so let's get right to our takeaways and number one don't let your math anxiety hold your kids back
math anxiety as we mentioned is a real phenomenon all over the world
yeah and it's pretty clearly related to how we teach math in school things like timed practice and <unk> and <unk> testing and oh my gosh i'm getting hot flashes and sweaty palms just thinking about fact tests
and here's the really upsetting thing is that math anxiety it's not equal opportunity
that's right it's tied to stereotypes race and especially gender research shows that mothers and preschool teachers who are overwhelmingly women they can pass that feeling onto their kids especially to their girls
but there is some good news
children are not born with math anxiety all right it's passed on to them so i think that's why we have to check ourselves
in when we're talking about math
this was kind of a surprise for me because i thought that you know if my kid had a problem with math i could bond with him by saying hey you know it was tough for me too
but actually <unk> says
saying i don't like math i can't do math that will get conveyed to your children
and the solution instead we need to reframe math
yeah <unk> says think about the fun activities that can back up and reinforce what they're learning in school
math is very much an integral part of your life do you love music
i do i love to sing
all right if you love music then you love math do you like to cook and bake
i love to cook and bake
okay then you love math because you can't do music and you can't cook and bake without math
so i can't cook or bake really and i definitely cannot sing but i love baseball for example and my boys and i we talk about baseball statistics all the time
so what's important <unk> says is recognizing math as part of many things that we like doing together
exactly and so to see more about how adults can weave math into our everyday moments of life even with really little kids you and i and our producer lauren <unk> visited a really special preschool
they came to watch us play today
hi
this is the center for early childhood education it's our research preschool at eastern connecticut state university the lobby has this giant super realistic oak tree
yeah which um i climbed inside very cool
nice to see you good morning
we should also say anya about a third of the kids at this school speak spanish at home
that's right and at the preschool we sat down with one of the lead researchers <unk> <unk> and she helped us understand a lot more about how to grow children who love math
the minute we say math we try to think of the big picture you know big old <unk> big old geometry concepts
instead <unk> says think small she's a professor in early childhood education at eastern connecticut state and her special focus is on early math learning
and <unk> and her colleagues have done lots of research to see what kinds of childhood experiences lead to better performance in math later on
and one of their answers makes up our second takeaway takeaway number two
talk about math take this really ordinary moment
you ask them to put their books away and then say it doesn't fit in the shelf so why doesn't it fit
maybe it's the book is too tall too big
<unk> says you're actually talking about a math process it's problem-solving
yeah and we heard lots of this by the way math talk at the preschool
does the duck fit in there too um he didn't fit when he was standing up
so you decided to lay him down does he fit now
that's <unk> lopez the lead teacher for the toddler classroom
it's a sunny room with a cozy reading corner there's a play kitchen and blocks
and near the center the room there's this table and <unk> sitting with the children they're building together with <unk> which are these colorful plastic blocks with different shapes that stick together
and they also have little plastic farm animals and one of the kids is kind of putting together a house
now you're using triangles and squares
naming the shapes in both english and in spanish when we played this tape for <unk> she said
what i heard there is the teacher using descriptive math language and that is so key for children to understand math concepts
you can't understand the concepts without the language
yeah and <unk> not building the blocks for the kids she's actually making observations and kind of like <unk> their thoughts in real time
the more blocks you add the longer it gets <unk> i noticed that when you added more your line gotten longer and longer
when she said more blocks to make it longer i mean longer is a complex word for children
and they need to hear that language and they need to hear that language in a very concrete way
she wasn't even afraid to use really technical words like when this little boy was trying to make his little <unk> stand up
now you can put them all around the perimeter all around the edge
perimeter
yeah
another great occasion to talk math as <unk> said earlier is in music class
i'm going to give everybody two rhythm sticks one for each hand we have smooth rhythm sticks
do you want to touch it
feel
that
yep and
you probably remember the kind cory they're perfect for hitting your friends
yeah
do we tap them on our friends
no
do we bang them on the floor
no
what could happen
and after this moment the children practice going faster
and then they go slow
one
faster and slower are relational concepts these are math words related to rhythm
so when we were talking to <unk> i had an epiphany anya that my all-time favorite sesame street moment
and i watched a lot of sesame as a kid
that's not obvious
it was a math moment and it's with my favorite character grover
um um
and he's so he's standing there in the foreground and he says near
ah huh
and then he goes way back here
far
near
far epiphany
so the point is parents get approximately one million billion chances all day long every day every night to talk about math
that is of course a rough estimate but think about it
there are calendars and clocks money maps measuring crafts
it's very broad and i think that once parents understand the breadth of how we define math and how they are already doing it they go oh that's math
i didn't realize that was math oh if that's math then i could do that
setting the table <unk> correspondence that's math <unk> number first second third that's math
yeah and if you need even more chances roll the dice on our next takeaway takeaway number three
play math
find ways to keep math in mind when you're playing with your kids <unk> says you may already be doing this
just play
and research has shown that when parents just play they're actually really really good at pulling out these deep concepts from children much better than even teachers
there's so many ways to play math with kids of all different ages
right there are puzzles of course and blocks like we heard with <unk>
there's video games and apps card games and especially board games
research has shown that the more kids play any game with dice and numbered squares the better their basic math skills get
you can even play math outside
i can give a big push to the swing or i can hop three times to go there
at <unk> house <unk> had negative one
which is kind of mind-blowing to me
yeah
um and she says you know play can be the foundation even of advanced subjects like algebra
algebra is you know of all the math concepts algebra seems to ah shake many people's nerves
but what is algebra really if you think about it
it is recognizing that there are patterns in numbers there are patterns in um equations and you know you're you you're trying to balance the two sides of it
take this little moment in <unk> <unk> toddler room
when you put your triangles together it makes a square look
same same
same same they match
just like that one you made one that is the same great discovery
same same
exactly so as you know cory i have a <unk> at home and i was getting so excited at this point
because i felt like hey i'm ready to be the a plus a p <unk> mom
but narrate every moment of block time i'm gonna use perimeter and <unk>
rein it in <unk>
ah what
come on i'm <unk> to go let's get those flash cards come on
remember <unk> warned us
um and this really rings true for me
one thing i would tell parents not to do is to become the teacher in the house
ah um all right
i i get this
yeah i mean for one thing it's it's kind of annoying
you know when we play with our friends we're not constantly asking them let's count how many there is this what does this shape we don't do that
she doesn't know what i do with my friends i i might quiz my friends
i don't wanna hang out with you
oh fine
all right the most important reason to not be so <unk> when we're playing with our kids is takeaway number four
math like life is so much more interesting and fun when we can get beyond right and wrong answers
for example <unk> said this
we are sitting at a round table and i could ask you anya what's the shape of this table
i know it's a circle you know it
i mean so it's but a better question would be to say anya why did you choose the circle for our table
that is better because she's actually interested in my answer she doesn't know what i going to say
i don't know why you did that right but that gets us talking about shapes
it's a real conversation
yes and it's the kind of conversation that you could have with kids at almost any age
or another interesting question <unk> says might be how do you know the table is round
it's going to make them look at that circle one more time and to see that you know this it feels um <unk> and the other one feels sharp on the edge
so the key here is to keep things open-ended
so we saw another great example of this in other preschool classrooms there was a four-year-old boy named achilles kind of messing around with some blocks
and the teacher <unk> <unk> was a master she just backed off and let him do his thing because you know what he's doing
he's he's trying things out he's testing out hypotheses
this is data it's probability
it's not about getting to a certain place in the end
do you want the wheel to go under it or over it
over
over it
yeah and remember this is play it's open-ended
there's no right or wrong she's letting him figure it out
do we need to ah change any blocks or add anything to make it jump higher
and <unk> says there's a social and emotional point we're making that goes deeper even than the math here
there should be no fear in making a mistake
let's say that again no fear in making a mistake
that's basically how children learn it's all trial and error for them
and they're also looking to us how we react to making a mistake and that's part of resiliency
and it's really helpful to communicate this attitude when our kids are a little older like mine are and they're learning math in school on somebody else's schedule
yeah i mean the pressure just gets higher from year to year and so the most helpful that we can be as parents is not to be <unk> them through their homework but try to make it feel okay to mess up sometimes and also to keep going
because it's all part of the process
yeah failure is important which is a lesson the count had to learn
oh i cannot believe it i the count made a counting mistake
well just a little one oh the count
so ah as we said in the beginning you know he messed up it wasn't his fault
he decides to quit being the count
yeah and he goes in search of other employment
all right construction worker all right we're gonna have to hammer five nails into this here beam
all right
it turns out there's things you've got to count um um in doing construction and measuring and all this kind of stuff so there's no escaping at there
again this ken <unk> the head writer at sesame
so he left that he became a rocket guy there have to count down
ten oh nine eight
and what finally gets the count back on track is actually another mistake
yeah his friend <unk> steps in and pretends to mess up his own counting just to help the count know that it's okay to mess up
five six seven eight nine
but i need ten carrots
wait the i believe you made a mistake <unk>
oh a mistake
yes you said four twice ah you should count the carrots again
oh <unk> can't do that to count <unk> made a mistake so <unk> gonna give up counting
give up
give up
no no no no <unk> no <unk> everybody makes mistake
you cannot give up ah the important thing is to keep trying
<unk> actually told us this is a good tip for parents to try too you can make a mistake and give your kids a chance to correct you with math or you know anything else
i did give up but i shouldn't have i i must keep trying and you should too
yeah
so come let's count the carrots together
cool
one carrot
and just the way <unk> did you can build up their confidence
nine
ten carrots altogether
so we started off this episode talking about a topic that i don't particularly love math but we ended up somewhere really great cory
because i feel like all of a sudden i realized that through exploring the world with my kid i can spark my curiosity i can look at stuff with new eyes
and i can go back and get a redo on something that wasn't so fun for me when i was a kid
yeah and i got to do my grover impression
great same same even steven
same same all right time for recap
we got to go through all our takeaways but gosh i ah i can't i can't remember how many we had um
anya do you remember
no i don't think i remember can maybe we can get some help
i've waited all season to do that
awesome
all right so takeaway number one don't let your math anxiety hold your kids back
yeah find math in everyday activities that you enjoy together
takeaway number two talk math
yeah triangle square perimeter near far up down longer shorter
faster slower
they're all talking math takeaway number three
play math
<unk> and <unk>
puzzles
books
<unk> on the playground these are all ways to practice numbers shapes problem-solving
even probability and algebra and takeaway number four let's stay away from the right and wrong answers
keep things open-ended
because math like life is so much more fun and interesting that way and so you know what
i'm inspired i'm do like the count i'm put my cape back on
and i'm gonna go <unk> my love of math
our special thanks to <unk> <unk> jeffrey <unk> julia <unk> and the whole team at the center for early childhood education at eastern connecticut state university
i also have to thank the math learning researchers who helped me process my math anxiety jo <unk> <unk> <unk> and ann <unk>

i'm cory turner an education reporter with n p r and the father of two boys
and i'm anya <unk> i'm also an education reporter and the mother of two girls
and for the beginning of this episode of life kit for parenting with sesame workshop i'm gonna step out for a minute
yeah so
yeah so we decided to try something ah with a very special guest who has ah a really interesting relationship to self-control
me using me podcast voice me hope this okay
that's right it's cookie monster in the fur
hello hello cory yes that true me self-control expert
so thank you for having me on show thank you
ah expert
yep me control myself all the time
ah just this morning me told me feet to walk to studio and me told me hands to brush me fur for important podcast interview
um cookie
that's not what we meant
also in the studio with cookie and myself was <unk> <unk> she is senior vice president of curriculum and content at sesame workshop
we're talking about <unk>
regulation what regulation
that's how we help you stay calm and resist the impulses of always eating cookie and
sorry you you no want me to eat cookie
why and no and why me do that
lots of reasons cookie
tell me one
okay so <unk> helps you um learn and it helps you stay healthy
okay
and it helps you get along with people frankly
really
yeah
yes and that's that's a perfect example we have cookies here
cookies
ah wait wait
where
cookie stay calm we have cookies here for a snack
yeah
ah but our friend anya isn't here yet to eat them with us
give what
well we have to wait for her
that's exactly right and sharing would be the kind thing to do don't you think cookie
yeah that good point yeah me get it
me get it yeah
you know what me me ready to give this try
yeah me waiting yeah
okay this you know this feel like long time this
okay cookie
let's let's stop and think here
yeah
um how can we distract ourselves so we're not gonna focus on these cookies right now
how about we start with some nice deep belly breathing
oh me know that one
that
okay so in through your nose
and now slowly out through your mouth
cookie you're breathing on the cookies
and me tummy grumbling you know me tummy has other ideas
we got to try different strategy you know me not gonna look at cookies
how about that
cookie that's a great idea and a great strategy we're gonna turn our backs on these cookies so we're not gonna see them
oh okay oh it it's not easy cause me still can smell cookies
oh boy
<unk> i don't think that's working
yeah
i got one
i got one cookie
yeah
have you read anything interesting lately
oh well me just finished doctor <unk>
really
yeah
what how was it
ah it delicious
little dry
me had to dunk it in milk
oh you know what you guys
we have we have these cookies here but i don't have any milk ah you know
we've got a fridge i'm gonna go i'll be right back
okay
is it is it safe to leave the cookies here are you gonna be okay
me gonna try me best cory
promising anything
okay i'll be right back
hurry there he goes
oh cookies look so yummy
okay while cookie monster waits in front of that big plate of cookies and we're gonna make him wait a while
let's take a quick break and when we come back more on the science and the art of <unk>

we're back this is cory
and i'm anya
and we're gonna finish our <unk> with cookie monster in just a few minutes
but first we should acknowledge it's pretty surprising that <unk> become so skilled at <unk>
so i remember as a child watching cookie monster and just being like what is wrong with this maniac
that's <unk> <unk> an expert on <unk> who we'll talk to in a bit
and yeah i have to agree anya the cookie we grew up with
was pure
cookie
cookie
but <unk> from sesame says <unk> transformation was actually really really intentional
sesame street every year we focus on a critical educational need in children's lives
and it was about seven eight years ago when all of this research started to come out ah showing the importance of the <unk> skills and how they were related to school achievement school readiness and life lessons
and that is exactly why we're gonna be talking about this today
yeah and sesame decided once they knew all of this the cookie monster was the perfect <unk> to send this message
let's not define him as this impulsive character who has no self-control because he can have self-control
so after
three years
cookie evolves
yes
and he becomes someone who what
it's much more reflective who can actually stop and pause and control his emotion and his desire for eating the cookie right away
that's inspiring <unk>
yes it is
yeah it's inspiring for me as a <unk> that i have one more year to get all my self-control together
i believe in you
well well thank you very much ah <unk> hope here was
that we could model the strategies for children to learn and apply the strategies and build their own <unk> toolbox
and several years ago sesame backed a study to see if this could really work
and so some of the kids in the study watched videos of cookie monster practicing the strategies kind of like you heard at the top of the podcast
me got new strategy
then <unk> says the researcher tempted all the kids with their favorite snack
chocolate <unk>
and the kids who watched cookie monster
on average waited four additional minutes
four minutes that is huge for a <unk>
huge
so let's break this down for a minute
yeah
what does not eating cookies have to do with being successful in school or in your life
<unk> explained that <unk> isn't just about treats ah ha <unk> is a set of skills that helps us reach our goals
specifically we need to either monitor or change or redirect our thoughts feelings and behavior toward a particular goal that we've chosen
yeah and within <unk> you're gonna hear us talk a lot in this episode specifically about self-control which is either resisting an impulse or overcoming a temptation on the way to a goal
so self-control means more than resisting a cookie
it means not hitting a classmate on the playground when he takes your <unk>
it means working through your math homework and not throwing a tantrum when you get stumped
yeah it can even mean working through a big fear that you have when it <unk> you
and all of this is a big deal right now not only because of the new research that <unk> referenced but also because there's just more and more kids out there with diagnosed issues that can interfere with the development of <unk>
things like childhood trauma a d h d or being on the autism spectrum
also many parents especially privileged parents are basically stepping into their kids lives to smooth over their kids paths and remove any sources of frustration really before their kids have a chance to learn how to deal with it
i don't know what you're talking about cory
i appreciate your honesty
i mean i i can see that this is very well-meaning and a lot of parents just want the best for their kids in a really competitive world
but what we're doing also <unk> them of the natural opportunities that they might have to learn <unk> along the way
and that's what's going on in in in children's lives right now that they are becoming <unk>
they want everything done for them
and so sesame decided to send the message that you know if cookie monster can learn to control himself anybody can
but i was kind of skeptical cory i wanted to learn more about the science of this right
because obviously i see that my kids as they grow up they get better <unk> my <unk> is not as good at waiting as my <unk>
right
um so you know is this really something i need to coach my kids on is this like do i just send them to self-control summer camp
yes and no
ah some of the variation is genetic and and you're right that children's brains do naturally develop along these lines
but ken <unk> who we heard from earlier who said cookie monster was a maniac
yeah
um he happens to be a professor psychology at the ohio state university and he describes it this way
so the brain and you can think of as being like the hardware
but even when we have the hardware we still need to learn how to use the hardware with the right software
so by software <unk> talking about the skills and the strategies that parents can help kids practice to improve their <unk>
exactly
there is a lot of research supporting very specific interventions so without making everybody wait any longer let's open up the toolbox and get right to our takeaways
all right and takeaway number one is big picture advice for us parents
we need to start thinking of <unk> as a skill to be practiced
exactly
so this part made me think about when my husband was teaching our older daughter lulu to ski right
so first she was kind of freaked out the mountain is right big
she is small it is cold
and he had to begin by really acknowledging all of the big feelings that she was having and <unk> says we should do the same thing when we're working on a skill
you need to validate children's emotions i know it's hard
i know it's hard the worst thing to be is like you know oh it's easy don't worry it is so no
so you've done that <unk> and then you have to move on to the nuts and bolts
what is it that you actually do you know you don't just tell the kid ski down the hill and you don't just tell a kid control yourself
yeah don't don't throw a tantrum
right
that doesn't work you can't do it that way
so when you're skiing you break down the skill into tiny pieces and there are strategies that you can use for each one
for example when you want to slow down you point the <unk> toward each other and ah the code word for that is pizza okay
like it's it's a slice of pizza the two <unk> coming together
thank you life kit skiing
yes now and the analogy here is we're taking <unk> or self-control these big big concepts and we're breaking them down into very specific strategies that we want our kids to try
right and the other key thing to remember is that our kids are gonna fail and probably fail a lot
yeah
before they succeed and and we really have to not only accept that failure but praise their effort every chance we get
so even if it is i just waited a minute praise the effort i waited a minute
yeah and next time maybe they'll wait two minutes
totally and here's the thing i mean obviously not every kid needs to learn to ski but every kid needs to learn to regulate their emotions
and they can as long as they have a coach
yeah so let's let's look at self-control again what is the first step to not hitting your friend or not throwing your homework across the room
tying your hands behind your back
a better way is not getting so mad in the first place
and that's why we need to start here when it comes to teaching our kids to regulate their emotions because it's <unk> right
so takeaway number two yelling calm down at your kids when they get really worked up that doesn't work
yeah i know this because i've tried it
i have tried it too many times
i mean it's just really common to respond to our kids frustration with our own frustration
but there is something that can help both of us as long as we're consistent both our kids and ourselves and that is our slow deep breathing
belly breathing comes in so taking those deep slow breaths in and out
just like i did with cookie monster i know it was silly and probably sounded a little ridiculous
but it works i do it at home i do it at work
you can ask all of the life kit producers it works
and it's important to make it a habit
and you know what that's not all cory
you can teach your kid to hug a pillow or a stuffed animal to calm down you can also try this craft
okay take a jar fill it with glue water and glitter
and then make sure you screw the lid on really tight that's important
and whenever they're feeling stressed out you can tell your kids to give that jar a shake
i know i'm overwhelmed right now but let me just breathe and focus on how that glitter is swirling around which represents my feelings right now
but if i belly breathe and watch the glitter settle it gives me the time to calm down
all right so belly breathing glitter jars our next takeaway zeros in very specifically on self-control
that's right takeaway number three pretend the cookie is plastic
all right yeah so you've probably heard of the <unk> test
it was a famous study that was done where children were offered a <unk> to eat
and they were told they could eat it right away but if they waited they could have two of the treats later
yeah so this study is so famous if you just go to youtube and type in <unk> test you'll find all kinds of videos of kids being subjected to this sort of torment
i'm gonna go do something and then i'll come back
it smells yummy
ah it smells really good
the experiment has been repeated many many times since it was first done by walter <unk> in the late nineteen sixties
and there has been some controversy over what it exactly proved especially with some of the long-term outcomes and when you take factors like social class into consideration
yes absolutely but at the same time that basic experimental design with kids and treats and a timer
it's a really good context to see the strategies that children can and do use when their self-control is being tested
what seems to lead kids to be tempted by the smaller immediate reward the one <unk> um is the fact that they're thinking about it in a hot way
and by hot ken <unk> means intense or urgent something that you wanna act on right now but he says
if kids could find different ways to cool their thoughts um they were much more likely to wait out the delay
um and that knowing the strategies seemed to predict which kids were able to delay and which ones were not
for example kids pretended the marshmallows were just <unk> clouds or that they were looking at the marshmallows through a picture frame
what i really like about this cory is that kids are using a strength their imaginations to overcome their weakness in self-control or delaying gratification
and <unk> told us that practicing the strategies and learning them learning about them can be really empowering and actually therapeutic especially for kids who struggle with <unk>
yeah and all the experts told us it's really important that practice not only happen in moments of crisis but you really lay the groundwork for it so that when those hot feelings arise they turn to the strategy and use it
so you plant it and then it pays off
and then it pays off later exactly
now takeaway number four speaking of imagination this is my favorite takeaway
i'm so excited about this one what would batman do
yeah ken <unk> told us about a fascinating study
it's a variation on the <unk> test where researchers asked kids to do a very boring task while they were simultaneously tempted to play a fun video game at the same time
but then
they asked kids to to identify their favorite superhero
and this is so neat we talked about this in a previous episode right
the characters like superheroes or princesses they're so powerful for kids whose <unk> are really just starting to form
so if kids said batman for example they would get a batman mask and a batman cape
i'm <unk>
and the kids were told while they were waiting out the delay they should ask themselves the question what would batman do
and what they found was really startling
so the kids who were <unk> their heroes were much more able to resist the temptation
i love this and i i'm totally gonna use this although ah you know it's a problem cause like for me um it wouldn't be the normal bat it would be
cory look over there it's a bright
what
oh i see what you did there um ah nice nice <unk>
takeaway number five be smart about distractions
getting out of a hot moment sometimes can take distraction just like when you asked cookie monster about his taste in russian literature
right or like when you're in the car with your kids and suddenly they transition from are we there yet to mom he's hitting me dad he's hitting me
ah that is the perfect time to resort to distraction like travel <unk> or the license plate game
i'm going to take my attention off of this treat and place my attention on something else so i'm gonna go play with something else
right and every parent knows like rosemary says you need to have a long list of potential distractions up your sleeve right
it could be reading it could be singing
it could be <unk>
it could be drawing
or <unk>
you mean like dental care
no no i mean like
you mean like <unk> care yeah got you
or i don't know <unk> a million different videos of lego batman rapping when you're supposed to be writing a podcast script
that's a good distraction
we have no idea about that and speaking of distractions
flip side here
removing distractions can also be an opportunity for you to set your kids up for success when it comes to self
frankly your co-host
or your co-host
so the idea here is remove opportunities for frustration right so maybe when they're working on their homework you keep the video games out of sight
or maybe you don't keep the cookie jar on the counter instead you go out for ice cream once a week
yeah and and you want your kids to build self-control
but you need to do it in a really age appropriate way you don't wanna exhaust them by testing their self-control constantly
and you also don't wanna set unrealistic goals that you know they're never gonna get to
and there're so many different ways to approach this our takeaway number six is the world is already full of opportunities to build <unk> skills
so we've been talking about explicit strategies mostly for self-control but researchers are also backing up something that parents and educators have known for a long time
yeah there are so many everyday experiences that can build this broader set of executive function and <unk> skills
ken <unk> says for him one area was music
i attended music schools um i played violin and piano
did he love to practice no
nobody wants to practice um practicing is very tedious
um nobody likes to receive negative feedback right
um but you know but responding <unk> to negative feedback um to you know enduring the the drudgery of of of everyday practicing these all require self-control
another activity that experiments have shown to improve <unk> is martial arts
i'm also a martial arts instructor i practice the japanese martial art <unk> the sword fighting
um and i have been amazed at watching children transform in front of my eyes some of them come in very <unk>
but you know a couple of years of really hard intense training and practice and commitment they learn the value of delaying gratification
anya i just have to say for the record forget what would batman do from now on i'm asking myself what would ken <unk> do
totally
and um let's also add to the list of martial arts um learning a foreign language ah huh practicing yoga
yeah
definitely proving strategies for building <unk> skills
okay you guys cookie has been waiting all the time
yeah remember at the top of the episode cory left allegedly to get milk
we've been sitting in a different studio recording this whole podcast
ah i left him hanging he's practicing his strategies
i hope he's
his strategy
i hope so too so i guess it's time for me to go in there and say hi
oh and i still need to get the milk
all right i'll see you there in a minute
all right
oh hi hi anya
hi
hi <unk>
oh are those cookies
one
oh ah boy you know anya me no can believe me saying this but we need to wait to eat cookies
cookie this is so hard for you but you're doing such a great job
yeah yeah all this waiting getting really hard for monster
cory
oh oh you back
yeah please hurry ah
okay oh ah you waited to eat the cookies thank you
and i'm so proud of you cookie monster
oh thank you me really appreciate that
but me also appreciate cookie
that was some serious <unk>
i love the way you yelled cookie like some <unk> fiend what
that's just what you say when you have a cookie
anyway i miss those cookies already
well i miss cookie monster i i felt like i could tell him anything
let's recap
let's do it takeaway number one
it's for us parents start looking at <unk> as a skill to be practiced
yeah learning social and emotional skills is like learning to play baseball or to ski
only much more important
we need to be supportive as parents and we need to validate our kids big feelings
also break up the skills into pieces give them strategies to get better and praise their efforts along the way
takeaway number two yelling calm down doesn't work
no we tried that it does not work
yeah
so instead
try belly breathing
a glitter jar
you can hug yourself hug a pillow hug a stuffed animal
and don't just do it once or twice make it a habit
takeaway number three pretend the cookie is plastic
kids have really vivid imaginations and they can use them to reframe a temptation
takeaway number four
a reminder that for kids <unk> their heroes can make it easier to live up to their values including by being more patient
i love that it's so creative
takeaway number five be smart about distractions
when waiting is hard or kids need to cool down read a book sing a song
there is a long list of things they can do that will help
on the other hand if they're trying to finish their homework put that video game system out of view set them up for success
yeah distractions work both ways
takeaway number six the world is full of opportunities to <unk>
yeah martial arts music yoga even learning a foreign language
they can all improve our self-control and our <unk> both for kids and for grown-ups

hello and welcome to radio ombudsman
this is rob <unk> and my guest today is marie anderson the northern irish public service ombudsman the northern irish judicial appointments ombudsman
and the northern ireland um local government commissioner for standards many things and soon to leave to become the police ombudsman for northern ireland
marie you're extremely welcome
you're greatly admired and respected throughout the ombudsman world and um we're lucky to have you
we like to start each episode of radio ombudsman by hearing a bit about our guests in terms of their background
where were you born for example and brought up
what kinds of values do you remember being <unk> with early on
well thank you rob and thank you for the kind introduction
and it's great to be on the this innovative programme radio ombudsman
where was i born i was born in belfast in northern ireland
i was born into a a large family i was the youngest of family of six
west belfast um in the nineteen sixties when i was born was a place of of much turmoil
and and my early
early childhood adult life and into my time at university was very much a a time of conflict in northern ireland
i came from very religious background where values were very important
so there was a a a willingness and a a desire on the part of my mum and dad to bring us up regardless to respect everybody and to respect everyone's views and religion
that's interesting and that really <unk> the follow-up question which is what do you learn and take from those awful situations
the need for fairness is very is very important part of communities getting getting on together
if one community feels they've been dealt with unfairly or one indeed one individual or a group of individuals that is you know potentially <unk> for society and for that community
so i realised very early on something that i think is probably part of my nature which is this desire for fairness
does that explain why you took a law degree
in part one of the things that i've i've spoken about openly is the fact that i was in a ah you know a convent school
and i was there's a particular day i was called out of the assembly
i was twelve thirteen and i was hugely humiliated and embarrassed by the fact that i was being accused of stealing another girl's gym shoes when i hadn't
it was a mistake and that mistake came out but i remember that that feeling
i think that was the more cathartic moment if you like feeling of ah it's not i was on my own
and i was dealt with unfairly and i wanted to be a lawyer because i was gonna help people that were treated unfairly
so that that's what made me want to be a lawyer really
yeah okay
and after university i know you became a solicitor but was that straight away or
yes yes i didn't i now nowadays like interview there gap years
but yes i i went to the institute of legal studies ah practiced as a solicitor in private practice and then in the public sector
and mostly litigation and but started to focus on human rights and data protection freedom of information when i was in the public sector
so when did you join the information <unk> office
two thousand and three
okay and what what did what did you do before then
before then i was i i worked for the ah the housing authority
i worked for seventeen years in the legal department of the housing authority dealing with intractable problems such as <unk> behaviour homelessness fractured communities we had to be housed near to each other
yeah
and so issues such as peace walls
so it was a good it was a good it grounding if you like for dealing with the issues that i deal with my but also in terms of the information
you know i recognise the need for for freedom of information and for people's information to be protected
and i really i loved my time in the information <unk> office i was there five years
and you spent some of it in in manchester
was a treat
yes
privilege
yes
and it was a a a time of emerging from you know the office was changing from being the data protection commissioner a kind of a registration function
and had taken on freedom of information which was so exciting
and it was about the office getting geared up for freedom of information and indeed having regional offices
and the one in northern ireland i actually helped establish that office
and when did you become an ombudsman
oh in two thousand and nine so after leaving the i c o i went back to private practice
i worked in a commercial law firm and then realised that really wasn't for me that i was much more i my my main interest was social justice
so i so the role of deputy ombudsman and i thought that's interesting i'll think i'll i'll put my hat in the ring for that
and yeah i i was lucky i got the job
and you were lucky enough to work for the legendary tom <unk>
dr <unk> yeah he's he's been a huge support to me throughout my career and you know and and mentor
and yes legendary
we were talking earlier today about leadership and his famous phrase on leadership is i am their leader which way did they go
so it's kind of you know for to be a leader you need to to have followers
absolutely
okay so ah for for our english listeners and for those in the united states northern ireland is obviously unique politically and socially
but i don't think that many of us have a great deal of understanding of how this must have impacted on your work as an ombudsman
could you say a little bit about that
well i think because the first <unk> office in northern ireland was created in nineteen <unk> so we are we are celebrating our fiftieth anniversary year this year
it was it was created to deal with complaints of discrimination in housing employment and particularly in local government
i think that the genesis the idea for an ombudsman was to bring fairness to the citizen
and i think that's that's really been always a a a a key element of the work of the office
i mean we feel it very very strongly that we are in the justice business that it is about but you know being fair
and not only being fair to <unk> or people who feel the public services services have failed them but being fair to to to those that are wrongly criticised or wrongly blamed
because i think an ombudsman the role of an ombudsman is also to provide <unk> when things gone right
what about the impact of <unk> on your work both inside the office and externally as as ombudsman
well we you know i have ah a workforce who believe totally my staff totally believe in fairness and equality
and it doesn't matter who complains to the office that it doesn't matter who complains or what the nature of the complaint is that we're gonna deal with it
but i suppose where the area where which is most challenging is in my role as local government standards commissioner where i myself have been accused of <unk>
because you know i was <unk> on a a a particular councillor from a particular ah part of the <unk> community
so there is that added layer of not only wanting to do things right to make the right decision but being aware that no matter what that decision is it might please one side or the other
so to be accused of <unk> was a huge hurt for me because that's not that's not part of my values or my staff values
i mean that's a big issue because it affects you personally
how do you deal with that because you're a very resilient tough person but even that must be hard to deal with
well first of all i've got huge support from my deputy and the senior management team who reassured me that of course this isn't true and you know it isn't true and we know it isn't true
but i think what was difficult was the impact on my family and how they felt
my husband was angry and and my children were unhappy about it
and how did it affect me i learnt to deal with i learnt that you can deal with this sort of criticism
and i learnt that ah behind it all you've got to be sure that you're doing you're making the right decision
i can remember a few weeks ago when i was savagely criticised on twitter
and i was <unk> to reply and my oldest son said to me leave it alone dad they want you to reply
and i think that was quite wise advice
so you do need to consult with people on personal issues don't you
i think you do need to consult
and you do of what what's been helpful as been part of the ombudsman <unk> ah response to this is and you the personal support you've given me rob i was able to talk to you about it
i was able to talk to others like the current police ombudsman for northern ireland who've said leave it alone
just leave it because if you do anything if you take any legal action then it's merely going to provide more oxygen
yeah
doesn't stop it being difficult
no
personally difficult and that's where the resilience comes in
that's where you've got to get up the next morning go into work and your staff have got to see that although it might affect you inside
that you're gonna continue to lead the office and do the job
thank you that's important
let's just move that's on a little bit and talk about human rights issues in relation to the actions of public services
you launched a brilliant human rights manual which sets out an approach that many <unk> in europe take
but it's not particularly prevalent in the united kingdom about actions that can be taken by an ombudsman
could you tell us a bit more about how you created this
well it was created jointly with the northern ireland human rights commission and it started as ever as as all good ideas with a conversation
and it was a conversation between the human rights commission and our office around the sort of case work that we were dealing with
we were dealing with issues like the <unk> community and feeling discriminated because they didn't have access to health services
we were dealing with issues of consent patients not giving consent to interventions and the family and the patient feeling excluded from the decision-making
but also we realised that <unk> and human rights commissions and and or equality bodies are actually doing the same job
so we mean ah my my style is to move on from the conversation and actually have a product
and the product was how to do this manual for ombudsman staff
how to introduce human rights principles into ombudsman investigations
and it's quite simple and it's not about <unk> jurisprudence
that's the beauty of it i think for <unk> ah you know for for <unk> staff that they're they're very simple principles
participation a person affected by a decision by whatever public service provider be it health be it housing be it ah you know local government that they have to be able to participate
they have to be given enough information to participate effectively in the decision-making
so there's the principle of empowerment and the giving information
there's the principle of <unk> and being treated treated equally and fairly and having equal access
and ultimately like the fourth principle of the human <unk> approach is accountability and that's what we <unk> do
we hold public services to ah kind
and would you say that you've been able to hold public services more to account as a result of having that human <unk> approach
yes i think <unk> is a tool
but i think that having a human rights lens allows you to look more closely ah away so much from the process as to how the process actually affects the individuals and affects the individuals rights
so if give you an example we had a case where a young man died as a result of a a routine ear operation
and and it was a <unk> reaction to a <unk> implant to the packing around a <unk> implant
the point being his his mum and dad believed that he wasn't consented for that intervention
the and and the thought was unfair and affected his human rights
the coroner had refused to undertake an inquest saying it didn't affect his human rights
when it came to my office we identified the human rights principle of participation
if i know what is gonna happen to me if i'm told of the risks ah instead of someone else making decision for me then my human rights have been respected
when i drew that out in the investigation report i i was able to come to a conclusion that ah where there was a it was a conflict between the experts
some said well another consultant might not have done the implant another said they would have they would have and they would have gone ahead with the implant
but actually the human <unk> approach meant that i thought about the individual and that they hadn't been properly consented
the result not only did the family get an investigation report identifying this issue but they were able to go to the coroner
he he's commenced an inquest
now you you have two things in northern ireland that we don't have you have a
partly because of your own excellence and bringing it about you have an integrated public service ombudsman scheme and you have the power of own initiative
are these valuable additions to the way <unk> should be working
i i do believe in the <unk> model
the public services ombudsman in northern ireland and looks at complaints about government departments statutory agencies local government health and social care education schools universities colleges
i think that can be challenging for staff but i believe that they enjoy the variety
but i also believe that an ombudsman ombudsman principles of good administration apply across sectors
so yes i think it is the value
i think having one place to go to to seek redress for injustice is is important
if people don't want to go to court there's an ombudsman there that can look at the full range
own initiative is for me an essential tool of every <unk> toolkit
when you look internationally
you look at <unk> in australia you look at <unk> in europe you look at <unk> north america the ontario <unk> the rest western australian <unk>
they all have own initiative they've all had own initiative from the start
the irish <unk> act that was created in nineteen eighty had own initiative there as well as dealing with individual complaints
for me an ombudsman without own initiative can't fulfill the the the mandate of ah ah ah improving public services for many not just for the individual
um so you would you you'd have no hesitation about introducing and initiative it's essential
not not at all i was lucky to be part of the development of the public services ombudsman act
and was keen to had had an opportunity to persuade officials who were perhaps nervous about the an ombudsman having own initiative powers
that really this was something that actually could benefit public services in the end
see it is about prevention
you can deal with numerous complaints but never get to the core issue whereas own initiative allows you to tackle the core issue of systemic failing
well i i agree with that
and that's why i think it's necessary for us to have the reform that you've already been operating for nearly three years now
yes and now ah the welsh ombudsman is about to get that also
i believe scottish ombudsman would like own initiative
so if that happens it means <unk> administrations have it
and the first ever ombudsman in these islands the parliamentary ombudsman has not
and i think that's missing an opportunity to to improve public services for the citizen
as you move on from the public service ombudsman what what are you most proud of
is it bringing the whole thing together the integration of the various systems
well i think the legislation that allowed the public services ombudsman as a <unk> for complaints about public services
but also being able to bring in local government standards
because northern ireland was one of the was the only part in europe didn't have a mandatory code of conduct for local representatives
that was introduced in two thousand and fourteen
and my office and my so and and i as deputy ombudsman now ombudsman have been key to establishing an investigative and <unk> function in northern ireland
that that is a unique model but i believe operates very well
that is not work that is out with <unk>
because for me ethical standards values fairness they're all part of good governance and the that's where we <unk> are
we're not a court we don't declare don't make binding decisions
but nevertheless we can influence with the recommendations that we make and with setting standards
now we asked colleagues on twitter to send in questions
and we had a set of questions from one dissatisfied user of the service under your predecessor who felt that she hadn't been treated fairly by the system
what can you say to people in that position
i think that ah many people misunderstand the role of the ombudsman
they believe that the ombudsman is there particularly to advocate for them and their particular issue
<unk> are impartial so if there the a finding of no failure can be disappointing to <unk>
and i believe that was the case in relation to the particular and individual that you're referring to
so the previous ombudsman did not find in her favour and that can be disappointing
but then you got to understand that there're the other side of that is that perhaps a clinician or a a member of health staff who has been criticised receives ah ah you know a message that actually they did it right
but there are many occasions in which <unk> don't agree with my decisions
but i still have to decide fairly ensure there's a fair process ensure everyone gets an opportunity to comment and and and report on the matter
ah that's that's what an ombudsman does
yeah it's difficult sometimes to explain that while the complaint belongs to the <unk> the decision belongs to the ombudsman providing it's evidence-based and and rigorous
provided it's evidence evidence-based and rigorous but also i believe fair
we have to give everyone and opportunity including those who are criticised
but this issue about it's an ombudsman decision while you bring your complaint
it is the <unk> decision has actually been written into the legislation that i referred to
which is that under the northern irish ombudsman legislation the two thousand and sixteen nine act that i mentioned that even if a <unk> withdrew their complaint i can still investigate
so it is the <unk> investigation
now you you've been with the office in northern ireland for ten years
so long time will you have any regrets about
moving on even though it's to an even more difficult and challenging role
i'd have huge i have huge regrets about leaving my staff because they are um they are wonderful to work with hugely supportive
and on days when i don't have my usual level of energy they give me the energy back to keep going
so i've regrets about leaving my staff
but i mean i was asked this question about why do you want to undertake the roll of police ombudsman
i do believe that i it's about public service and it's about bringing my experience
you said ten years experience in the <unk> office five years experience in the information <unk> office
it's ah bringing bringing that to bear in what is you know a very challenging area dealing with police complaints in northern ireland
now you've spent the day with us speaking to my colleagues at our <unk> away day
what advice would you give to ah younger colleagues many of whom of only recently joined the <unk> profession
the advice i would give is first of all it is a profession
as you know rob ah from your discussions with me i believe very much that that that it has to be recognised as a profession
and that um i'm amazed at your accreditation project at getting that off the ground
i would advise the young people in this office to take advantage of that
that is a wonderful opportunity and i realise the rigour and the commitment to achieving that accreditation but i would say go for it
i mean that that in this you are leading the way in ombudsman in the ombudsman world
it is um something that many have talked about i've talked about it myself
i've tried to do it but you and amanda have actually done it and i think that is amazing
so my advice is take the opportunity
marie anderson thank you very much indeed
it's been an absolute privilege and a pleasure talking to you
thank you rob thank you
thank you for listening to radio on ombudsman we would love to know what you think so please leave a review or comment
if you like what you hear please share and subscribe to future episodes
hello this is rob <unk> here welcoming you to another episode of radio ombudsman
i'm delighted to say that my guest today is rosemary <unk> scottish public services ombudsman
rosemary took up the post of ombudsman around the same time as i did in two thousand and seventeen and before this she was the scottish information commissioner
she has a wealth of experience in public service which we'll come on to
she has developed the idea of a <unk> standards authority in scotland which is something that i want to ask her about
rosemary you're very welcome thank you for coming
now we like to start each episode by hearing a bit about our guests and where they come from
so can you tell us a bit about your early life and the values you you got from that
i am hugely lucky i come from a very loving family
i have four younger brothers so i think it fair to say that um issues about equality were probably in there before i even knew the word
but my my family a military family so ah travelled around as a child
and mostly i'd say what i got from them was a real strong moral compass
not drilled into me must do this mustn't do that but about treating people with respect particularly when we were traveling to new places and meeting new people for the first time
and and i think that that moral and ethical background um not called that then
it was just try and be a good person tell the truth do your homework on time all these sort of things probably instilled in me a strong work ethic
but it also instilled in me a very deep level of caring for people
ah ah
because i was able to see over the whole of my life still am a whole range of people who have different starts in life different opportunities
and and i think within that i've developed my own sense of justice
and i'm hugely grateful to my parents they're lovely people
and and i even go with my brothers occasionally
when you were traveling around as part of the military family did you was that difficult did you feel like an outsider
yes and no to outsider
i went to a lot of schools so you had to learn to make friends quickly and you couldn't have a a long <unk> time if you like
because i lived a lot of time in in military accommodation that was like a big family of itself because you tended to be with people who were in a similar situation
but mostly i suppose i just tour as a big sense of adventure
it doesn't suit all but for me it was great because ah i just moved around and had a whole wealth of experience which i don't think i would've got in any other way
what did you study at university
well my main claim to fame i think sitting here in manchester is the thing that i'm probably most pleased with is my um m b a from manchester business school
um i also have a teaching qualification
but i think the m b a because i went back to that after i'd been working a while was probably the most enlightening part of my education
because again i learnt a lot about a lot of things but what it it gave me because i had the was able to reflect on a working background as well
what it gave me was a sense of how to ask questions and challenge in a way perhaps i hadn't done before that
they're very famous alumni from that m b a i think vincent <unk> is a graduate of that scheme did you know him
no i didn't in fact i i i don't think that any of my cohort ah are names that have ah come up to prominence
but have all gone on to do good things some very interesting things
and i i for myself because i was i was public sector at the time and i've remained public sector for most of the time since then perhaps have a slightly different view of it
because i was very deliberate in not always going down public sector routes for study or public sector modules because i wanted to learn more about different sorts of thinking
when did you decide what sort of career you wanted
i'm yet to meet an ombudsman who decided they wanted to be an ombudsman
yeah
i i think
i can own up to that
it it fair to say that
i wen to work i was working in china um lecturing in business and economics and i needed a job when i got back
so i thought oh they're advertising for investigators at the local government ombudsman that will do for a while it'll pay the mortgage until i get something else
and i've pretty much never left <unk> or information <unk> since
and i think what it was was like found a job that i enjoyed it was challenging but actually fitted in with my value system
right and you've had a very distinguished and varied career you were the scottish information commissioner
and what what was the highlight of that before you came to the scottish public service ombudsman
i think it's hard to say what highlight is in terms of being the information commissioner
there are a number of things that i did that i was really proud of in a good way
one of them was it it sounds very trivial but we established a portal for the uploading of freedom of information statistics from public bodies in scotland
and what that means is now there is a three or four year database of the number of freedom of information requests and the outcome of them for the whole of scotland
that we can look at trends we can look at developments
and that actually for me was a highlight because i didn't necessarily have the enforcement power to do it
it was done through cooperation and <unk> with public bodies
ah the other couple of things that really stick in my mind was very very early on a particular decision i made
which was enforcing and telling the scottish government they had to disclose whether they had taken legal advice about <unk> position with europe
should they gain independence because it was the time of the independence referendum
yeah
and and why that's particularly interesting is it was a very big issue i think in the independence referendum and nobody i think would have foreseen where we are now
the finals one which i think i'll talk about more when we talk maybe about some of the um ombudsman powers
was about a different way of intervening in relation to good and poor practice with scottish public bodies
you're you're english i think is that correct
yes
so has there ever been an issue about you holding prestigious and important jobs in scotland
about an english person having that responsibility
no um i have a scottish name <unk> is a scottish name and i'm married to somebody from a scottish descent
i was once asked by a journalist was i happy that i had adopted scotland as my home
and i think it's fair to say the answer reflected how i felt which was i'm eternally grateful that scotland has adopted me as ah somebody who lives there and does these things within scotland
but no it's it's a different experience to being in england but i've never not to my face anyway ever had an issue with being english
that's good to hear
and now can we just talk a bit about um the scottish ombudsman which you took up post nearly three years ago
the <unk> ombudsman are different from the u k ombudsman
because they're more modern they've adopted legislation to make them more relevant to developing situations and you have more powers than the u k ombudsman has
what what's it like being ah the head of an integrated public service ombudsman is that a good thing
yes i think it's a very good thing because you have a different sort of insight you have a different sort of overview and sectors do vary
the there is variance because they're working to different regulations it it makes your job very varied also
um i think one of the the challenges with it though is if you work in a specific sectors
so if i reflect on local government ombudsman you became much more immersed in the <unk> of local government
when you work across sectors what we find is particularly a personal reflection is um i have to do a bit more digging around to find out about how the the sectors operate in scotland
and um i also rely quite a lot on professional advice particularly for health and social work
so we don't necessarily develop through experience of volume of cases the same experience that you do when you perhaps looking at
at one particular area of public service
but the other thing that i think reflects with um myself and the welsh and the northern ireland ombudsman is because the population of the country is smaller
and the country itself has a a different sort of structure to it
you often get given things to do that are not necessarily what you'd expect an ombudsman to be doing
so as well as complaint handling and the the complaint standards we also have duties for with the final stage of appeal for a benefit scottish welfare fund
and then when you look at northern ireland and wales they also have other things that are different
and and i think that is as much a challenge as anything because it's almost like running two completely different functions but trying to have an integrated organisation
okay so you rely on professional advice but there must also be a challenge for your case handlers to deal with the the width of functions that they come up with
are you divided according to the sectors or to to people have
multitasking to do
they have multitasking to do and they are incredible set of people my investigators
but i think one of the things that drives us and that is probably the the uniting thing is very much about values
and i think like most ombudsman organisations i've ever come across um it's a fairly unique workforce i would say
because you ask anybody why we're there and very rarely will you deviate far from because we want to make a difference because we want to see improvement because we want to make things better
so yes it's a challenge having the scope and we have some individuals who may have a background in a particular area but we don't have specialists
okay now what you have which we don't have is the status of being a complaints standards authority
could you explain to our listeners briefly what that means
briefly what it means is the ombudsman is responsible for setting a model complaints handling process that all scottish bodies must follow
and we then with that have a duty to monitor performance in relation to complaint handling and combined with some of our other powers duty to enforce good practice to report on it
now that sounds you know oh that's nice model complaints handling
but what it means in practice is with some slight variations by sector um because different sectors have slightly different needs
it means that anybody making a complaint to a public body in scotland and about a public body in scotland is basically making a complaint under the same set of standards
so the model complaints handling process says that the first stage of a complaint you must try and respond within five working days to resolve it
very big focus on resolution
if you can't or the person is not satisfied you can then take another twenty working days to look at it in more detail
if it's something that you think you need more than twenty days for then talk to the <unk> about that
but it essentially means that if somebody does not receive a response or doesn't receive a response in time they get to the ombudsman a lot quicker than they might otherwise do
the other benefit of the complaints model complaints handling process is that there is a very strong focus on learning from complaints
so the standards that go with this which incidentally i have to lay before the scottish parliament the standards
they also have a very strong bent on learning from complaints
and i think that's an area where we can perhaps develop more in how we hold public bodies to account to demonstrate that learning
because like our complaints the model complaints handling we have to show that there is an impact and that there is value to individuals and to public services as a whole
ah i think for me the the most valuable thing about it though is it gives you an opportunity to work with public bodies not always in opposition to them
which with the best will in the world however much you try a resolution or a a a sort of <unk> way of looking at complaints
once a complaint has reached the ombudsman it is in many ways adversarial whether you want it to be or not
but when you're talking about complaint handling as a whole you have an opportunity actually to help public bodies
and encourage them to get better at complaint handling which you hope means they get better at learning from complaints
which means people get the right service the first time
i don't think we'll ever eliminate complaints but certainly it it hopefully will make it a more productive experience
now i i'm a full supporter of what you're doing
i'm a burglar of your practice when i was the higher education ombudsman i stole it hook line and <unk> to use in english universities
the idea that they could resolve complaints within five days was <unk> to them they wouldn't they wouldn't have that we ended up with ninety
but ah nevertheless they they did it
but the difference and the the radical nature of what you do is effectively you are a regulator now
whereas ombudsman have traditionally always said we rely on our moral authority not on a <unk> power
has that made a difference or is it just words
no i i don't think it makes is made a difference yet
i i also think i should add that i wasn't ombudsman when the complaints standards authority came in
yeah
and credit has to go to jim martin my predecessor for driving this yeah
yeah
what he's left me as a legacy is something really good to develop and work with which is what we're doing now
having been information commissioner which really is a regulatory function you your decision is binding or you go to court
i think the concept of regulation probably hasn't crept into our thinking with complaints standards in quite the same way
but it is something that we currently developing but maybe not calling it regulation in the same way
because one of the things that i would say learning from hindsight is that we took a very structured approach of rolling it out sector by sector this model complaints handling
and what that meant was it was a number of years before every public body in scotland was following this
so the n h s was the last and that's been the last just coming up to the end of their second year
now if you compare that to the first which was local government
local government now is a really high percentage of complaints get ah responded to in the first instance in the five working days
ah i think from memory it's it's over eighty percent and that's really significant for <unk>
now what we've been looking at in the last few months and we went live with in april is what we've called our support and intervention policy
and this is a a concept that i brought with me from being information commissioner
and and basically was looking at all the powers that you have as an ombudsman because the real value comes in the combination of them not just the individual bits
so when you look at the powers to set complaint handling processes to take action if complaint handling falls short you then look at other things like your information gathering powers
we've created a framework which sets out what our powers are and within that what we are going to do to either support or if necessary intervene
because when we for example a simple example we might see a number of complaints from a public body where the final response that they give to the <unk> does not <unk> the ombudsman
they have a duty to do that under the complaints handling process
so we are getting better at our own intelligence we're logging feedback recommendations observations from ah what we see in complaints
so if we spot something like that we might just well my my investigators my complaints reviewers will let the the public body know
we give feedback in decisions
if we keep seeing that we might give it more formal and say we spotted this a number of times
but is there any help yeah we might offer to say share a template letter
or if it's something different perhaps go and give them some training if we've got the resource to do that
but we set it out step by step at which point it becomes a management issue and senior managers might actually contact senior managers or chief executives
the ultimate being we use the powers that the ombudsman has to enforce and report
very incremental and <unk> but ah do you do you come across <unk>
well it went live in april and so far we've not found <unk>
and i think some of this is drawing on experience of
information commissioner of that i'll give you a very simple example
similar powers to compel production of information for an investigation
and telling public bodies very formally if you do not provide this this and this by this date i will report on this i will take further action
it can actually be contempt to treated as contempt of court in scotland
so you only need to make that clear that you're going to do it and to do it once and then report on it in your annual report
and actually public bodies realise i think that you're being serious
but we try to get to the point before that where you point out this is the value particularly for the <unk> of doing this
so we're in early days we haven't come across the real <unk> yet
but i've no doubt that there'll be some there at some point
but the word <unk> is a good one and we will endeavour to be as <unk> as we can but firm with it
what what is your you report to the scottish parliament
yes
what is your relationship like with that body
i'd say it's pretty good in the sense of it's open challenging and when i say friendly i don't mean we're all friends it's it's it's very professional in many ways
so i my main dealings are with the scottish parliamentary corporate body
i get my funding through them so we have contact with them on a fairly regular basis
each year i appear before the local government to communities committee to be held accountable for my annual report
so they'll ask me questions about our performance about what we're doing
i do appear before other committees as well either in relation to other policies or in relation to other consultations that we've responded to
i would say in scotland that generally the ombudsman is held in high regard and seen as being independent and impartial
and probably the the the most telling evidence of this is we're taking on new powers next year
this is about <unk>
yes we i'm taking on the wonderful title of independent national <unk> officer for the n h s in scotland
wow
and the reason that we are taking on this function is because the government's public consultation it was suggested it should be the ombudsman
it's another good example of how in a smaller jurisdiction you get a number of different things
but going back to parliament they have held me to account on things but also where i have brought something to them in my my committee appearances they've also been quite supportive
so one of my <unk> about my legislation is complaints must be in writing unless there are special circumstances
now the problem with that is the onus is on the <unk> to show special circumstances
and it means you can't be as flexible in how you take complaints
yeah
and i've been trying since i became ombudsman to have the legislation it's secondary legislation to say i can take complaints in any format
and at the last parliamentary appearance the committee did actually write to the government and say we think this is a good idea please could you look into this again for us
sadly the scottish government are not taking it forward at this time because they have other business and don't have the resource apparently which is very disappointing
we're coming towards the end but let me ask you a few <unk> questions
so you're funded differently to the way we're funded because we we get our money from a broad treasury vote
but you're funded through parliament
have you got enough money is that a satisfactory way to do things
no i haven't got enough money
and it's satisfactory in the sense of i think it is good that the funding doesn't come from government
it adds something to you being able to say i am independent what i think is <unk> about it it's ah probably the same for you it's the <unk> of it
it's very difficult to do proper business and resource planning when you can't guarantee you will have the money to do it next year
it also means that i feel like do go through some fairly unnecessary hoops just to get one additional member of staff or an extra little bit of money for this
where it does work well and where i think the corporate body really try hard for myself and other parliamentary crown appointments
is they hold a contingency fund to which we can apply
for unexpected things so if we were <unk> reviewed we could get legal costs through that
and that works well to point we had some unexpected i t costs this year which we were able to go to the contingency fund
but generally i i think ombudsman across the u k are underfunded
if we had sufficient funding we wouldn't have <unk> of cases we would be doing things quicker
but we have to make do with where we are at the moment
two final questions rosemary first of all going forward um what's your biggest challenge as the ombudsman
are you an <unk> or are you an ombudsman
i'm happy to be an ombudsman because that's what the legislation says and i know the origins of the word
but equally i don't mind um if other people call me something similar whatever they're comfortable with
it's the spirit of what we do that's really important
i think my biggest challenge and the biggest challenge for my office is a combination of <unk> and the <unk> work that's coming next year
that's fundamentally different in some ways
would you have regulatory powers
my powers will be very similar as they are to ombudsman
right
this is big
yeah
and it's very different from what happens in england
it's it's almost two similar but completely distinct functions
there're two different titles that go with them ombudsman and independent national <unk> officer
so as a result of that
i don't know
i say i would like one ah i do the job anyway
but i suppose for me the issue of the pay is not so much for my tenure but for future ombudsman
because i have a real concern across in in common with fellow ombudsman in the u k the
if you don't pay your ombudsman enough to attract good ombudsman you can't forever rely on what i think has happened so far
just ah in scotland we've just got good people who've been attracted to the work
yeah
so i hope they up the pay but if it's not for me i don't mind
what does the legislation say about second terms for <unk>
in scotland there are on their second terms
so you after five years you have to move on do you
i
so it under um public sector law it can be four to eight years
so as information commissioner i actually had a <unk> tenure this one is eight years
but at the point that i became ombudsman it was already known that we would be taking on the <unk> so it's probably right for that
because just the the nearly three years getting to the point of knowing what the legislation is going to say has been over and the blink of an eye
okay last question we're in manchester this is a young thriving organisation full of young graduates who've just come into the ombudsman world
perhaps a hundred and twenty young graduates in the last eighteen months
you're an experienced highly respected member of the profession if i can call it that
what what would be your advice to my colleagues just coming into the <unk> field
don't ever lose sight of the passion of what drives you to do the right thing for the right reasons
but leave <unk> for a while and go and do something else and come back to it
so that you can see just how wonderful a <unk> organisation is but also so you have a different perspective on world experiences
that's lovely rosemary it's been a great privilege for us to listen to you
thank you very much indeed
it's been a pleasure to be here rob
thank you for listening to radio ombudsman we would love to know what you think so please leave a review or comment
if you like what you hear please share and subscribe to future episodes
it's quiet out here there're <unk>
the sun is warm but it's not too humid it's actually kind of a great day for fishing
why it <unk>
yeah what does it smell like
it smells like dead fish
it smells like the water
what is going through your head right now
i don't know thinking about what they they went through
i don't know i just wonder a lot what it was what it was like
they say our people were born on the water
when it occurred no one can say for certain perhaps it was in the second week or the third but surely by the fourth
when they had not seen their land or any land for so many days that they lost count
it was after the fear had turned to despair and the despair to resignation and the resignation gave way finally to resolve
they knew then that they would not hug their grandmothers again or share a laugh with a cousin during his <unk> or sing their baby softly to sleep with the same <unk> that their mothers had once sung to them
the <unk> eternity of the atlantic ocean had severed them so completely that it was as if nothing had ever existed before
that everything they ever knew had simply vanished from the earth
some could not bear the realization
they heaved themselves over the walls of wooden ships to swim one last time with their ancestors
others refused to eat mouths clamped shut until their hearts gave out
but in the suffocating hull of a ship called the white lion bound for where they did not know
those who refused to die understood that the men and women chained next to them in the dark were no longer strangers
they had been forged in trauma
they had been made black by those who believed themselves to be white
and where they were headed black equaled slave
so these were their people now
what happened here um
i mean we really don't know a lot
a pirate ship by the name of white lion sails into the bay here
and they needed to trade something of value so that they could get supplies to make the rest of their journey and what they traded were twenty to thirty africans
and this would be at this place um kind of ironically called point comfort where slavery in the british north american colonies that would go on to become the united states begins
from the new york times magazine i'm <unk> <unk> this is sixteen nineteen
that's your happy valentine's day <unk> this is a tape for <unk>
hello darling how you doing excuse me while i partake of this cancer stick
that's okay
when i was a child my dad always flew a flag in our front yard our house is on a corner lot and in the front yard right in the corner was this
i couldn't tell you how tall it was it always seemed really <unk> tall to me at the time ah there was this very tall aluminum <unk> my parents didn't make a lot of money so our house always had paint <unk>
and there was always something about the house that was in disarray you know the grass was looking disheveled or the railing on the stairs was falling off but the flag was always pristine
as soon as it started to show even the slightest <unk> my dad would replace the flag with a fresh new flag
he would never allow a tattered flag to fly and i didn't understand it i i didn't know other black kids whose parents were flying a flag in their front yard
i know lots of white people who flew flags lots of white people who flew flags
my dad was born on a <unk> farm in greenwood mississippi where his family picked cotton in the same cotton fields that enslaved people had picked cotton not too long before
that county <unk> county in mississippi lynched more black people than any other county in mississippi and mississippi lynched more black people than any other state in the country
so it was a pretty <unk> violent and hard place to live
my dad's mom fled the south like millions of other black people during the great migration and came north to waterloo and found many of the same barriers that she had sought to escape
she was forced to buy a house on the black side of town most jobs were unavailable to her so she cleaned white people's houses my father went to segregated schools
and at a young age my father joined the military so that he could get his way out of poverty but also for the reasons that so many black people join the military
which is he hoped that if he served his country his country might finally see him as an american
he loved being in the army he was stationed in germany picked up german very quickly he was so smart
he loved talking about that time it was a period where he got to see things that a poor black child born in mississippi would not normally get to see
but the military didn't end up being a way out for my dad for long um he was passed up for opportunities
and the only jobs my dad ever worked were service jobs he worked as a convenience store clerk or a bus driver and because of that
this big pristine american flag flying in the front of our yard was deeply embarrassing to me
and i didn't understand why he would feel that much love for a country that clearly did not love him
i felt this way all through high school i was no longer standing for the national anthem i had stopped saying the pledge of allegiance and really
throughout most of my adult life i mean clearly i know i'm an american
i was born here every family member for generations back that i know were all born here but i never felt like i could claim fully that i was an american
but it wasn't until i really started researching and reading and thinking about this project that my own thinking started to shift
that i realized my dad understood things that i never knew
i now understand for the first time why my dad was so proud to fly that flag
my name is fountain hughes i was born in charlottesville virginia
my grandfather belonged to thomas jefferson my grandfather was one hundred fifteen years old when he died and now i am one hundred and one year old
now in my boy days we were slaves we belonged to people they'd sell us like they sell horses and cows and <unk> and all like that have an auction bench
put you up on the bench and bid on you the same as you're bidding on cattle you know
but still i don't like to talk about it because it makes makes people feel bad you know
so you kind of have to put yourself in the scene it is june of seventeen <unk> and thomas jefferson
at the very young age of <unk> years old has been tasked with drafting the document that is going to declare to the world why the british north american colonies the thirteen colonies want to break off from the british empire
he goes to philadelphia and rents two rooms on the edge of town along the river and sits down to draft what we all know now as the declaration of independence
when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another
so he's sitting at this portable mahogany writing desk that he carries with him and he pulls out some paper and a very nice quill pen
and he starts to write these words that almost every american can recite by heart
the declaration of independence we hold these truths to be self-evident
they become some of the most famous words in the english language
that they are endowed by their creator with certain
life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness that's what makes us unique that's what makes us strong the shared values that we all hold so deep
but what most americans don't know is that while he's writing these lofty words for liberation
he had brought with him one of the many enslaved people whom he owned in order to serve him and to keep him comfortable now that enslaved person was a teenager
and that teenager was the <unk> of thomas <unk> wife what that means is thomas <unk> father-in-law had children with one of the women that he enslaved
so actually he was thomas <unk> brother-in-law and so as he's writing these ideals he knows that they will not apply even to his own family members
at that time that thomas jefferson is drafting the declaration a hundred and fifty years have passed since those first africans were sold into virginia
the enslaved population has grown from twenty to now five hundred thousand people fully <unk> of the population is now enslaved
it has grown from a conditional institution where some of those first twenty were able to become free after a term of time to one where black people are born into it
they die into it and they pass that status on to their children you now have generations of black people who have never known a day of freedom and who will never know a day of freedom
and yet when thomas <unk> contemporaries talk in public about why the colonists need to be free from england they refer to themselves as slaves
and slaves to the king of england and so the colonists are being criticized in newspapers for this obvious duplicity by those who don't believe that they should break off from the british empire
one of them writes how is it that we hear the loudest <unk> for freedom from the drivers of negroes another writes to benjamin franklin and says perhaps you should ask the people who are actually enslaved what slavery is like
thomas jefferson of course is deeply aware of the hypocrisy and aware of the criticism of the hypocrisy so as he's drafting the declaration
include the passage in there where he actually blames the king of england for introducing slavery into the colonies he calls slavery a crime and he says that the king of england committed this crime
but that's not our fault it was not our doing this is just one more thing that the king of england did to wrong us so he brings this document to the continental congress
and it doesn't take long before delegates from the <unk> and from georgia look at that language about slavery and one can imagine they said what the hell are you doing
and they say that there is no way that they are gonna sign this document as long as that passage about slavery remains and so it is struck and the thirteen colonies sign the declaration
and the declaration goes out into the world without mentioning slavery at all and we start the revolutionary war
somehow miraculously these thirteen scrappy colonies managed to defeat one of the most powerful empires in the world and we become a new nation
and so the colonists gather and they try to figure out the language that they are gonna create in the founding document that we of course come to know as the constitution but now they have a problem
they were trying to leave behind an old country that they believed was antithetical to freedom and create a new one that they believe will be defined by freedom
this was a country that was going to be based on individual rights on a government of the people for the people and by the people
but this was also a place that at this time was still practicing the institution of slavery
and so the colonists have a choice to make are they going to be the country of their ideals the ideals that they were putting to paper a country based on the idea that all men were created equal
and if they were going to be that country then they were going to have to abolish the institution of slavery or were they gonna be wedded to the institution of slavery because they depended so heavily on the wealth that was being generated from it
and in that case they can't really write the document that they want to write and so what they do is they decide that they are going to try to have it both ways
and they bake that contradiction right into the constitution both <unk> and protecting the institution of slavery but never actually mentioning the word
and so they have written what is perhaps the most radical constitution in the world and from the beginning they knew they were going to violate its most essential principles
they call this new country a democracy but it wasn't one not yet
on august fourteen eighteen <unk> abraham lincoln invites five free black men to the white house for a meeting
they are part of the black elite in washington d c and he wants to have a conversation with them
the civil war has been going on for about a year and abraham lincoln is worried because the war is not going well and because it's not going well he's feeling like he might have to do something drastic
he's considering taking this very radical step of liberating all of the enslaved people who are in the confederate states
and he's thinking about doing this as a war tactic understanding that if he takes away the <unk> labor force that might cripple them or at least the threat of it would force them to remain in the union
but he's also concerned about what it might mean to suddenly free four million enslaved people and what the consequences of that might be
i can imagine these five distinguished men are very excited to get lincoln's invitation they are <unk> they have been <unk> lincoln to abolish slavery
but when they get there they are greeted by president lincoln and another man his name is james mitchell now james mitchell is a new employee he's only been at the white house for a couple of days
and his job is a new job and it's called commissioner of emigration now that's emigration with an e meaning his job was not to help people to enter the country but to help people to exit it
lincoln doesn't waste any time according to documents that recount what happened that day
he tells the men that he had gotten funds from congress to ship black people once they had been freed to some other country
and then lincoln said you and we are different races your race suffer very greatly many of them by living among us while ours suffer from your presence
in a word he said we suffer on each side
we are taught to think of abraham lincoln as the great <unk> and he was but the truth is like many white americans he was opposed to slavery because it was a cruel and unjust institution in opposition to this nation's ideals
but he was also opposed to black political and social equality as he said in a speech that he gave in eighteen <unk> he considered black people a quote troublesome presence
and that they were incompatible with a democracy that was designed for white people as he said in that speech free them and make them politically and socially our equals my own feelings will not admit of this and if mine would
we well know that those of a great mass of white people will not
as those five black men stood in the white house i wonder what it must have felt like
these men had been fighting for the liberation of millions and had waited for this moment only to be told that once they were granted their freedom they were going to be asked to leave the country of their birth
and to make it even worse lincoln then tells them that it's their fault that the country is fighting a civil war at all
he says although many men engaged on either side do not care for you one way or the other without the institution of slavery and the colored race as a basis the war could not have an existence
that's why the president said it is better for us both therefore to be separated
so lincoln ends the meeting and one of the men tells him that they will go back and consider his proposal lincoln then tells them take your full time no hurry at all
after that meeting those men made it clear that they were not interested in taking lincoln up on his offer to leave the country of their birth
there's a quote by a different group of black <unk> that really sums up the way that most black americans felt and that quote said this is our home and this is our country
beneath its side lie the bones of our fathers here we were born and here we will die
after everything that black americans have been through in this country that they didn't immediately take up lincoln's offer and go somewhere else and start over is really an astounding testimony to their belief in the american ideals
by choosing to stay black people were saying this is our country we are american and we're actually going to work to make these founding ideals a reality
and in the years that followed after the civil war ends a very short period called reconstruction began
and so you see the formerly enslaved pushing their white allies in congress to start to change our founding documents and to actually resolve those contradictions that were baked in
they do this through getting amendments passed and of course amendments are the way that we change our constitution
so of course the very first amendment that they have to pass is the thirteenth amendment which <unk> the institution of slavery
and what's interesting about that is this is actually the first time that the word slavery is mentioned in the constitution is in the amendment that finally <unk> it
it also ensures for the first time that the laws cannot treat people differently based on their race this is called the equal protection clause
and this clause will be used again and again really all the way up until now to guarantee that all americans are treated as equal citizens
and finally they pass the fifteenth amendment which probably is the most important amendment when we're considering what a democracy is supposed to be the fifteenth amendment guaranteed the right to vote no matter what your race is
now it didn't include women at that time but it certainly set the stage and it for the first time guaranteed that whether you were born a person who was enslaved whether you were white or you were black you had the right to exercise your vote in this democracy
the only reason we saw all of these gains in the south was because there were federal troops there and those federal troops were holding back the violence of white southerners who were not interested in seeing these gains
this all changes with the presidential election of eighteen <unk>
it was a contested election and rutherford b hayes is the republican candidate and remember back then it was republicans who were the progressive party and they were the party of lincoln that was working to pass all of this progressive legislation
but rutherford b hayes really wants to win this election
and so he makes a deal with the democrats in congress that if they give him their electoral votes he will withdraw the federal troops from the south and end reconstruction
so he makes the deal and the troops leave and we immediately see white southerners implement a campaign to force black people back into the position that they had been in before reconstruction
the suppression of black life over the next five decades would be so devastating that it would come to be known as the great <unk> the second slavery
tell you the truth when i think over today i don't know how i'm living i'm the oldest one that i know that's living but still i'm thankful to the lord
colored people is free we ought to be awful thankful
if i thought that i'd ever be a slave again i'd take a gun and just end it all right away because you're nothing but a dog
you're not a thing but a dog
the day of days for america and her allies crowds before the white house await the announcement
i have received this afternoon a message from the japanese government which <unk> the unconditional surrender of japan
reporters rush out to relay the news to an anxious world and touch off celebrations throughout the country joy is <unk>
it's february of nineteen <unk> and a young black man is sitting on a bus watching the georgia pines fly past the windows he's on his way to see his wife and he's probably very excited because he's been away at war and he hasn't seen her in a very long time
he'd been fighting for this country in world war two and just that day he'd been <unk> discharged for his service but he is a black man who is returning to the jim crow south
what happened on that day is a story that will be told across the country
good morning this is <unk> <unk> speaking i'd like to read to you an <unk>
it was a story that would actually change the course of history
he's riding the bus through georgia
he wants to get off and use the <unk>
the bus driver gets upset with him they have a little bit of an argument <unk> doesn't think much of it he goes to the bathroom runs back to the bus and the bus keeps going but then a few miles down the road the bus stops
and the bus driver gets off the bus and then calls and tells <unk> that he needs to get off the bus as well so <unk> gets off the bus and before he can even utter a word
he's struck in the head by a police officer
and the blows keep coming and he coming to the point that <unk> loses consciousness
<unk> is still wearing his crisp army uniform he's been discharged just a few hours earlier when he comes to he's in a jail
i woke up next morning and could not see
he was beaten so severely by that police officer that he would never see again
so <unk> beating was not at all unusual world war two had done exactly what many white people had feared
that once black people were allowed to fight in the military and when they traveled abroad and they experienced what it was like not to live under a system of racial apartheid that it would be much harder to control them when they came back
black men in their uniforms were seen as being unduly proud so these men who had served their country who had come home proudly wearing the uniform to show their service for their country
would find that this actually made them a target of some of the most severe violence but what was unusual was what happened after <unk> case was picked up by the n double a c p and they take him on a bit of a tour
where they're saying look what happened to this man who served his country
and that's largely seen as one of the sparks of the modern civil rights movement
the second sustained movement of black people trying to secure equal rights before the law and an equal place in this democracy
and in nineteen <unk> three hundred and fifty years after the introduction of the first enslaved africans into the colonies
congress passes the last of the great civil rights legislation
it ends legal discrimination on the basis of race from all aspects of american life
we often think of the civil rights movement as being about black rights but the civil rights movement was never just about the rights of black people it was about making the ideals of the constitution whole
and so when you look at the laws born out of black resistance these laws are <unk> rights for all americans
this experience which black americans were having did not go unnoticed by the rest of america
i mean basically every other rights struggle that we have seen
disability rights gay rights women's rights
that people with disabilities were still victims of segregation and discrimination
all come from the efforts of the black civil rights struggles
so we are raised to think about seventeen <unk> as the beginning of our democracy but when that ship arrives on the horizon at point comfort in sixteen nineteen
that decision made by the colonists to purchase that group of twenty to thirty human beings that was a beginning too
and it would actually be those very people who were denied citizenship in their own country who were denied the protections of our founding documents who would fight the hardest and most successfully to make those ideals real
not just for themselves but for all americans it is black people who have been the <unk> of this democracy
when i was a kid it must have been in fifth or sixth grade our teacher gave us an assignment it was a social studies class and we were learning about different places that people came from
and this was her way of kind of telling the story of the great american melting pot so she told us all to research our ancestral land and to write a small report about it and then to draw a flag
i remember kind of looking up and making eye contact with the other black girl who was in the class because we didn't really have an ancestral land that we knew of
slavery had made it so that we didn't know where we came from in africa we didn't have a specific country and we could say that we were from the whole continent
but even so there's no such thing as an african flag and so i remember going to the globe by my teacher's desk it was on the <unk> along the left side of the classroom
and spinning it to the continent of africa and just picking a random african country
so i went back to my desk and i drew that random african country's flag and i wrote a report about it and i felt ashamed i felt ashamed one because i was lying
but i also felt ashamed because i felt like i should have some other country and that all the other kids could trace their roots elsewhere and i could only trace my roots to the country that had enslaved us
i wish now that i could go back and talk to my younger self and tell her that she should not be ashamed
that this is her ancestral home that she should be as proud to be an american as her dad was
and that she should boldly and proudly draw those stars and stripes and claim this country as her own
this episode of cocaine and <unk> is the second episode in a three part series on harper valley p t a
if this is the first episode of the podcast you're listening to i would recommend going back and at least listening to last week's episode before this one even if you're just a huge <unk> c riley fan and you don't even know who shall be singleton is
have you haven't heard last week's episode you'll be missing out on a lot of context and i'm not going to be doing very much <unk>
ah last week we spent some time looking at how far outside of the box shelby singleton was willing to go for a hit song now are we sure we know what a hit song is how to define it
it's safe to say any song that hits the top ten could be called a hit right okay this past may when i began working on this podcast i spent about a week listening to every song to ever go number one on the billboard country chart
in chronological order from the first year the chart existed in nineteen <unk> until this show's <unk> point in the year two thousand
i needed to make sure i'd heard them all to build a timeline of what happened in the mainstream of country music in the nineteen hundreds there were quite a few songs i'd never heard before
unless you've purposefully sat down to give yourself the same experience or spent the past seventy something years of your life glued to country radio the same thing is true for you number one songs hit songs completely absent from our personal experience of country music
even when the song at number one the week before or the week after is one of our favorite songs of all time now imagine how many top ten hits between nineteen <unk> and the year two thousand we haven't heard
probably hundreds of hit country songs you've never heard in your life i've never heard in my life so we can say all hits are not created equal not in the mind of the audience and definitely not in the mind of the record industry
i should give a disclaimer here that commercial success is obviously not everything obviously not a gauge of artistic merit
there are brilliant country artists who've never had a hit in their lives that's not what we're talking about today
but if we're saying top ten singles are hits and i believe we should say that then just having hits wasn't enough for this industry you had to have more hits bigger hits it was called the record industry
move units make money or get out of the way for the next artist who will always be scaling up anything that isn't as good as or better than the last thing you did
you might as well have not done it and you'll probably end up wishing you hadn't
i think the worst thing that could happen to a country recording artist in this climate is for their very first single to become a number one hit you can't do any better than that the only way to improve on that is to stay number one for more weeks
sell more copies even if you manage to do that it's only a matter of time until you put out a song that only goes to number two or number five
but that's still a hit oh sure sure it is or maybe it's the beginning of the end maybe you just don't have the stuff anymore <unk> we gotta get those numbers back up to where they were or well it ain't gonna be good
imagine you're a new country artist and your very first single goes number one country and pop how screwed do you think you are there aren't many people you can ask about this
billy swan is one <unk> c riley the singer of harper valley p t a is the other one those are the only two people alive who've had their first single go number one country and pop
neither one of them ever had another number one song
i've heard them both called one hit wonders
billy swan never even got back in the top ten although he did also write his one hit i can help and elvis <unk> recorded that so i assume <unk> doing fine
<unk> c riley put out five more top ten hits four of which crossed over into the billboard hot <unk> these are country songs by the way
none of that <unk> nashville sound stuff the industry bent over backwards to push at pop audiences <unk> was achieving crossover success with one of the most <unk> texas <unk> you've ever heard
and a hardcore country sound behind it that's not what one hit wonders do
but because her first single sold maybe six million records
nothing she did after that mattered
<unk> carolyn <unk> was born in a small texas town in nineteen forty-five in nineteen <unk> while still a senior in high school she married her boyfriend mickey riley and became <unk> carolyn riley so c stands for carolyn
her uncle was a country guitar player and songwriter nobody you'd know but in the tiny town of <unk> texas just the fact that he'd gone to nashville to record in a real studio was a big deal
or at least <unk> seems to think people thought so her husband mickey knew it was <unk> dream to move to nashville and become a famous singer he was supportive of that
but they decided to wait until <unk> finished high school and save some money for the move then <unk> found out she was pregnant and they had a baby in nineteen <unk>
yes that is four years after they got married and unless it took <unk> four years to pass twelve grade the math doesn't add up at all for her to use the baby as an excuse for why they stayed in texas i'll get to it in a second
one day <unk> says she gets a letter from the great pedal steel player <unk> <unk> who'd seen her sing at a local <unk> and just had to write her to say that he thought of <unk> singing every time he heard connie smith sing
once a day
now in just a minute you may decide <unk> making this part up but it is possible that it's true later you will hear she was able to sing in a somewhat similar style to connie smith so <unk> letter gives her a little encouragement
the next time uncle johnny goes to nashville he invites the entire family on the trip and they go still in nineteen <unk> here thirteen people pile into two cars to make the trip
up in nashville they drive around lower broadway to look at <unk> <unk> lounge ernest <unk> record shop and the <unk> auditorium all that country music tourist stuff
uncle johnny gets them backstage at the grand ole <unk> and <unk> all <unk> she gets an autograph from connie smith jackie phelps the guy you'd later see playing guitar on hee <unk> takes uncle johnny aside to give him some advice
your little niece is a pretty country girl and i'd like to save her and her husband some heartache if she's got talent tell her she doesn't have to sell her body to make it to the top she can make it if she knows the right people
but if she gets in with the wrong crowd they'll destroy her and her home too
you listening to cocaine and <unk> the podcast about twentieth century country music and the lives of those who gave it to us
my name is tyler <unk> <unk> i've heard these stories my whole life as far as i can tell okay freeze
<unk> c <unk> autobiography is really the only source i can use for this stuff and it's super <unk> to say the least
this is the first of several outlandish scenarios where famous people give her incredibly personal advice that is also so extremely specific
it's almost as if they can see into <unk> actual future mere moments after meeting her for the very first time
you're a professional musician a colleague of yours brings his niece to see a show you take it upon yourself to call the guy aside and tell him to make sure to let his niece know not to be a <unk> not likely
<unk> does go on to find herself in some bad situations and i don't doubt for a second that they really happened but believing her about that does not mean i have to believe everything else she says
there's all these run ins with celebrities who seem to have psychic powers the timeline she presents often makes no sense fine but at least one major part of her story is deliberately misrepresented
she is <unk> lying about certain things there's even a note at the beginning of the book about how several names and some details have been changed to protect people
basically it could not be more clear that this autobiography is more like what you'd call an <unk> the hollywood movie version of these events
they might as well have printed base on a true story on the title page i should say this is one of those celebrity <unk> that's written with the help of an author so you know it's possible this guy had a hand in these <unk>
you can make up your own mind that's what i'll say but this is gonna get real crazy so just please try to remember this
here's an example of a small type of thing that i probably wouldn't even mention if i only noticed it once or twice the book opens with her locking up the office building in nashville where she worked as a secretary
walking over to a recording studio and being greeted by shelby singleton handing her the lyrics of harper valley p t a we've got shelby saying it's just right for your voice tom hall has caught the angry mood of the country let's see if you can make it sing
the problem is as you'll hear in a few minutes the entire week before this <unk> had been arguing with everyone about not liking this song and whether or not it would be released under her own name or a <unk>
in the very next paragraph she says she'd already studied the lyrics which she would have gotten from shelby why does she have shelby presenting the lyrics to her here with such pomp as if for the very first time
as if she's never heard this song before like i said small thing i would let it slide but this is a death by a thousand cuts situation
there's at least one scene where two people go back and forth with lines of quoted dialogue in a conversation that <unk> was not there for and could not possibly remember with such detail even if she was blessed with total recall over a decade after the fact
there's one more scene where she's driving her car while upset quote half blind from the tears she accidentally speeds over some railroad tracks just ahead of a crossing train and i'm quoting here
the train loomed over me as i roared across the tracks missing my back bumper by less than a foot the vacuum created by the rushing locomotive and the rumbling wheels almost flipped my car over the screeching
um half blind from the tears gets she knows within a twelve inch margin of error how close a train passed to the back bumper of her car so that's what i'm working with here and whatever you'll see
okay we're still in nashville the night <unk> uncle takes her backstage at the <unk> when they leave the <unk> that night doyle <unk> of the <unk> brothers has agreed to listen to <unk> sing
if they'll come by the office of sure fire his publishing company a few days later they drop in to the sure fire office and meet johnny russell who is a staff songwriter there johnny russell listens to her sing
they decide to have her go in the studio that night and the next to record a four song demo tape they have a photographer take some pictures of her <unk> thinks all of this means she's on her way to becoming a star
the second night of recording within forty-eight hours of meeting her johnny russell pulls <unk> and her husband mickey aside to tell them quote i've watched you kids ever since you got here and i need to say something to you
nashville is good to you when you're on top but it's a mean city too this business of wanting to be number one gets in your blood it consumes you until you can't think of anything else it's like drugs only worse
cause there's nothing you can do to get rid of it you'll leave your family you'll leave your self-respect you'll do anything to reach the top and anything to stay there
i've seen it happen too many times most people think they are the exception they come in here with high morals and high ideals and lose them overnight the pressures are too much what i'm saying is this
i don't think <unk> can make it here she's got a good voice and you're a fine young couple but this city will chew you up swallow the juice and spit you out like a dry hull on the street go back to texas and stay there
wow that is one hell of a monologue huh i don't know how anyone gets anything done in the music business when they're delivering fully polished a hundred and fifty word speeches like that to everyone they've known for forty-eight hours
anyway after a week or so the texas crew heads back to texas doyle <unk> had told them the <unk> would be needing a female vocalist for their upcoming september tour of germany <unk> should expect their call
all through july she expects the call all through august she expects the call of course it never comes so she gets all <unk> out until mickey comes home from work one day and tells her to start packing he's sick of seeing her <unk> around the house they're moving to nashville
as they cross the city limits sign into nashville she and mickey make a pact that they'll always travel together as a family the baby too quote show business might chew up other folks and spit them onto the sidewalk but not us we'd show them
we would gonna make it together
this is the end of nineteen <unk> because of everyone <unk> starts having sex with and the fact that she changes their names
and the names of the companies they work for it gets really confusing to work out the specifics of what happens when and where for the next year
for instance she refers to her first manager paul perry as pete terry through her entire book because of the affair she later has with him this other guy gets named phil <unk> and he's a big shot at black rose records
based out of new york phil <unk> is our big bad wolf uncle johnny bought a gas station right before <unk> and mickey moved to nashville so that's where mickey starts working
they lived in a motel room than a small apartment <unk> keeps calling sure fire music to find out why they didn't hire her for that <unk> brothers tour she eventually finds out that tour was canceled and then gets to work <unk> her career by checking the mailbox
and waiting for the phone to ring she writes that she spends weeks waiting for the world to notice her <unk> her husband for working twelve hour days at a gas station to support her and the baby while also begging him to move them to a bigger apartment closer to his work
one day she finally realizes she's gonna have to actually try to get people to care that she exists she gets all <unk> up and drives with her baby down to music row to look for this powerful woman she'd heard of who was from a town in texas
twenty-five miles away from where <unk> was from she apparently thinks she can meet this lady say hey i'm from texas too and get a record deal or something
she has no idea where this lady's office is supposed to be she just starts walking into publishing companies to find out if that lady works there or not when some kid asks if she's trying to get a demo tape heard <unk> pulls out her tape and the kid takes a listen
he seems to like it plays it for his boss who says it sounds too much like <unk> lynn and they tell <unk> to kick rocks she goes back to her car with the baby and cries then decides to drive over to the gas station where mickey works
when she gets there <unk> talking to a guy named jerry <unk> a rich guy who owns a vacuum cleaner business but also wants to be a songwriter
you've heard the song he'd write a few years after this called a good year for the roses
mickey has a copy of <unk> demo tape that he plays in the gas station just in case someone important happens to come in and hear it and care
<unk> isn't really important yet but he did strike up a conversation and offer to play the demo tape for his friends at monument records a few days later he calls to say monument is interested
but they want to change <unk> name because they're already doing well with <unk> <unk> and let's not get carried away with the <unk> over here right our <unk> not thrilled about this
but jerry thinks they can get monument to back off the name change if they stay on it <unk> gets shown off at a d j convention introduced to everyone in town as tina stephens the next girl they're gonna sign and do big things with
but then she gets forgotten about because apparently a major female artist on the label doesn't like <unk> or tina or whoever back to square one
jerry <unk> meets a radio d j named paul perry who knows phil <unk> a made up name for a real important guy at black rose which is also a made up name for a real record label
remember this sentence that d j paul perry sends <unk> demo and a promo picture to phil <unk> in new york city
<unk> expresses interest in recording <unk> when he comes to nashville sometime in january it ends up being early february of nineteen <unk> when <unk> walks in to black <unk> office for the first time
she writes literally nothing about the conversation only that she finds phil <unk> very attractive and she leaves with a contract that night she begins <unk> that <unk> will fall in love with her
within a week in reality they've kissed <unk> goes back to new york city for business when he returns a few weeks later he and <unk> start having a full-fledged affair
now i don't like dwelling on this soap opera stuff unless the story cannot be told without it so here's the relevant information that d j named paul perry becomes <unk> first manager
she technically gets a single released on black rose records but it's only technically released no money is put into promoting it and not even <unk> thinks it's any good
but she does think she and this rich powerful man are in love with each other so she's not too worried about that record
then one day in <unk> apartment <unk> laying naked on the couch after having sex with him when she's suddenly blinded by flashes of bright light there's <unk> holding a camera with a <unk> flash attachment
<unk> <unk> out he tells her there's no film in the camera she asks if he really loves her he laughs at her says mean things to her about how stupid she is and she leaves crying
fast forward to six months later it's early in the fall of nineteen <unk> <unk> in las vegas for a week as johnny <unk> <unk> paycheck is on his way up after having his first top ten hit the year before with the <unk> machine
phil <unk> is also in las vegas but <unk> manages to resist his advances
fast forward again to january of nineteen <unk> <unk> gets <unk> to release her from her contract so she can go record for little <unk> records
this is the record label started by johnny paycheck and his producer aubrey <unk> who had heard <unk> sing in vegas and decided he'd like to record her
aubrey does record her a single is released on little <unk> but like the black rose single with phil <unk> it's only technically released not really promoted because they vowed wound up in contract difficulties
i will come back to this
meanwhile jerry <unk> has decided to get out of the vacuum cleaner business and all the way in to the music business opening up a music row office for his publishing company
he hires <unk> as a secretary which is where she's working when a songwriter friend asks her to sing on the demo of his new song he wants shelby singleton at plantation records to hear
i couldn't find a recording of <unk> singing it but i found the songwriter singing it himself so you can try to imagine what <unk> would have sounded like on the demo
clark <unk> old town drunk comes out on plantation records in nineteen <unk>
when shelby hears the demo he's more interested in the voice of the singer than the song if you listen to last week's episode this is the part where he wants to meet that singer to see if she's got the image he's looking for to sing harper valley p t a
here on <unk> side she wants to listen to harper valley p t a before she agrees to anything her manager paul perry thinks she's crazy for not getting on board sight unseen but he brings her a tape she doesn't like the song
just doesn't like something about it says it sounds like a soft redo of ode to billie joe now paul perry and all her friends think she's crazy she agrees to meet with shelby and there's something she doesn't like about him too
shelby tells her they can make a pop hit together but they'll have to change her name because there's too many <unk> in nashville same old story he wants to call her rhonda <unk>
she's thinking about that when perry says if <unk> doesn't take this deal then he can't represent her any more it's not gonna get any better than this she signs the papers goes home and cries about it
her husband mickey comes home to find her upset hears the story about them wanting to change her name calls paul perry and yells at him to tear up the contract <unk> not doing it
the next day all the business people convince her they'll let her keep her own name if she just comes in on friday after work to record this damn song the entire day friday <unk> pissed off at the world
she feels like she's being backed into a corner and talked in to doing something she doesn't want to do on top of that she's sure everyone's lying to her about getting to use her real name
still she goes to the studio channels her anger into the song and nails it on the second take
shelby tells <unk> they'll use her middle initial to make her stand out more from the other <unk> and add an i to her first name so people know it's not pronounced jean
finding out she really doesn't have to be rhonda <unk> plus the fact that everyone in the room seems certain she just cut a massive hit song improves <unk> mood
she calls her mother at one in the morning to tell her she just recorded a song that's gonna be the number one song in the country
the masters are mixed and sent to the pressing plant on saturday morning <unk> spends monday handwriting hundreds of personalized notes to go with promo copies to d js all over america
anytime she comes to her own name or the name of the song she switches from black ink to red so it stands out on the page a station in ohio plays the single <unk> times in one day other stations ban it because they don't like her <unk> tone
love it or hate it everyone talks about it according to <unk> she and mickey take a copy over to ralph <unk> at w s m
this doesn't necessarily conflict with jerry kennedy's story about shelby taking over an <unk> the night of the session <unk> would want ralph to have a real copy of the record but then <unk> says ralph tells mickey y'all be really careful
so many families break up as soon as the singer hits the big time
the next friday they're in philadelphia for <unk> to sing her song on t v saturday new york city <unk> with mickey paul perry and his wife shelby and a dozen other business people from nashville
a real entourage they stay in nice hotels drink champagne order room service and leave huge tips at dinners <unk> doesn't realize how all this works until later
when she finds out she's the one paying for all of that <unk> and mickey don't need the help spending money they're throwing down major cash on clothing jewelry <unk> cars all the usual rock star stuff
a week after new york they're in florida doing a show with <unk> jennings out of nowhere <unk> tells <unk> that she won't stay married to mickey for long because he just don't fit the scene
if you ever need to find out exactly what's wrong with your life all you have to do is go stand by a country musician for a few minutes they're all psychic and <unk> at the bit to give you advice
anyway pretty soon <unk> starts spending too much time with her manager paul perry one night they're sitting around holding hands and <unk> talking about how careful <unk> has to be now that she's on top
he sure hopes she doesn't have anything in her past that could come back to haunt her you know like <unk> pictures taken by phil <unk>
back in nashville first thing monday morning <unk> heads over to black rose records there's <unk> in his office packing up a stack of brand new <unk> c riley records
made from her old sessions with him now that <unk> got the biggest hit in the nation these records will sell
they argue she demands the naked pictures he plays stupid at first but then says it'll take him a couple days to get them come back wednesday skip to wednesday
<unk> got a <unk> envelope like you see in every movie about a private detective and he wants to give it to <unk> but first she's gotta sign a new piece of paper saying she won't sue him for releasing her old recordings
see he's legally allowed to do that and she'll even get paid <unk> and everything it's just that he lost their original contract so sign here and here and you can have those pictures
of course she signs the thing then without even looking in the manila envelope she asks him to burn it which he does in front of her by the time she gets home
half an hour later the news is reporting that black rose records has filed a lawsuit against harper valley p t a singer and record label for breach of contract
okay here's the thing phil <unk> and aubrey <unk> are at least partially the same person
you do remember aubrey right johnny <unk> producer that heard <unk> sing in vegas wanted to record her and that's why she got <unk> to let her out of her contract in the first place
yeah that's all bullshit
phil <unk> and black rose records are not fake names for someone and something that happened before <unk> got involved with aubrey <unk> and little <unk>
<unk> tells the same story two different ways as a red herring black rose records is little <unk> records
which is also the explanation for why <unk> would be in las vegas opening up for johnny paycheck when all she's supposedly done is one barely released single for black rose records
if you were to <unk> this episode and listen to the part about how phil <unk> came into <unk> c <unk> life you'd be listening to the story of how aubrey <unk> came into her life
you'd be listening to the story of how <unk> c riley came to be signed to little <unk> records
i know this because it's described exactly the same way in court documents related to the lawsuit <unk> just told us about
quote as to little <unk> records the amended and supplemental bill asserts that prior to the time <unk> was incorporated its president aubrey <unk> did business in new york new york
as an individual under the proprietary name of little <unk> records that his first knowledge of defendant riley was a letter addressed to him on the date of december eight nineteen <unk> by paul perry
<unk> the tape and photo mentioned
there was no barely released black rose single before the barely released little <unk> single there was one barely released single
the contract difficulties <unk> mentions to explain why her little <unk> single suffered the same fate as her black rose single that's this lawsuit the court document sheds more light on this
in response to <unk> lawsuit <unk> tells the court that <unk> was never convinced she had enough talent to succeed as a recording artist
and did not undertake to produce any records of her voice for general distribution
in other words aubrey <unk> didn't think <unk> was that good of a singer he was using her as little more than a session vocalist for demo tapes he needed done anyway while letting her believe she was a real recording artist
<unk> seems to think that one single was just him going through the motions to string her along and she's probably right
speaking very strictly harper valley p t a is not her debut single as i said it was in the intro of this episode but her first single may never have been meant for an audience larger than her immediate circle of family and friends
something physical for <unk> to play pretend with to keep the whole <unk> going it was called you write the music credited to jean riley released on little <unk> records in nineteen <unk>
<unk> first mistake was signing <unk> to a real recording contract which stipulated that she be recorded four times a year a <unk> not met by using her for demo sessions
his second mistake was releasing her from her contract on april third of nineteen <unk> four months before she recorded harper valley p t a
now here are the two big questions i don't think i can or should even try to answer did aubrey <unk> and <unk> c riley have an affair
and did aubrey <unk> take naked photographs of <unk> c riley without her consent and then <unk> her
technically <unk> has never alleged either of these things against aubrey <unk>
that was phil <unk> i'm gonna play it safe and point out that it's possible phil <unk> is meant as an <unk> of more than one person
i'm not in any way a professional investigator all i did was read a bunch of publicly available information and match it to what <unk> wrote in her book
as far as i can tell i'm the first reader of <unk> autobiography who cared enough to take the time to look into this or at least i'm the first one to talk about it
searching <unk> and <unk> names together only brings up information about them having worked together and information about this lawsuit but listen even if phil <unk> is one hundred percent aubrey <unk>
and even if we choose to one hundred percent believe everything <unk> says about him that still doesn't mean aubrey <unk> took those pictures <unk> says she had him burn the envelope without looking inside
she even brings up the possibility herself that the envelope could have been empty
it doesn't look like any <unk> photographs were mentioned in the courtroom at all
the case was ruled in favor of shelby singleton and <unk> c riley
back in the business of promoting their hit single <unk> gets sent to charm school to learn how to walk talk and act onstage
then she's sent on tour concerts talk shows radio shows live t v appearances her hometown names a day in april <unk> c riley day and there's a big ceremony for that
she gets to do <unk> wild mountain berries with glen campbell on t v
she gets to live her dream of performing on the grand ole <unk>
but then she gets her first royalty check and finds out how much of the money being spent is hers basically all of it she's always expected to hang out and be nice to industry people
one night there's a scene with mickey when a random suit at a party is too persistent in trying to get <unk> to dance with him mickey grabs the guy's wrist and tells him to back off
later shelby tells <unk> that mickey needs to stay home if he can't control himself and mickey is banished from the road
if you're starting to get the idea that <unk> always thought of as little more than a puppet for the people behind the scenes of her career i would say that seems accurate
now aside from the song itself the biggest impact <unk> c riley had on country music with harper valley p t a was in fashion
it seems ridiculous today but in the late sixty that line in the song about the single mother wearing <unk> that in itself was enough to make a lot of country music fans gasp and turn off the radio
and while the song is actually sung by the daughter character who doesn't dress that way every time you see <unk> c riley she looks like mrs johnson
her style or more accurately the style she was made to wear would best be described as mod like nancy <unk> in her boots are made for <unk> phase
way before any other women in country music were dressing that way we're talking <unk> <unk> boots and in october of nineteen <unk> the first year the c m a awards were televised
a ridiculous dress
the ruffles start halfway up her rib cage and <unk> way out like they would to make a bell shape down to the ground but then it all just stops halfway down her thighs showing off legs and high heel <unk> boots
after seeing the dress but before the show she called shelby singleton to yell at him in the middle of her <unk> after she tells him she's not miss harper valley p t a
she's an artist shelby cuts her off to say you're not an artist baby you're a commodity a <unk> silver booted commodity now be there early we've got a show to rehearse
that's one exchange that i don't doubt for a second happened just like that
the rest of <unk> book is about her struggles with infidelity and conversion to religion more people seem to have mystical psychic powers
like after a divorce from mickey a random sales clerk in a department store somewhere stops <unk> to say your ex-husband still loves you god wants you to go back to him bullshit like that
she tells the story of the first time she tries pot having an intensely spiritual vision that sends her into a <unk> state for close to twenty-four hours and sounds more like an ayahuasca trip than any weed i've ever smoked
from the nightmare she describes you'd expect that to be the only time she ever <unk> up but there's a video clip of ralph <unk> interviewing her seems to suggest otherwise
so i want to get away from her autobiography for the rest of this episode and talk more about the music <unk> made after her hit because that last sentence is pretty typical of the way people talk about <unk> c <unk> career
reference to her hit as if she had only one a one hit wonder if you will
while it's true she never took another a song to number one on both pop and country charts not many people have ever done that
the only other woman to do that in the nineteen hundreds is dolly <unk> with nine to five in nineteen <unk> making <unk> the first woman to ever do it if you don't count the farce with little <unk> records
which you should not she's the only woman to do it with her debut single it's so unfair to judge the rest of her output against that that's like mocking a rookie basketball player for only breaking a world record one time
<unk> follow up single to harper valley p t a was called the girl most likely
sticking with the formula it's another song about prejudice in a small town this time it's the girl who everyone thought would be the first one to get in that special kind of trouble only a teenage girl can get in
only turns out it's the miss <unk> two shoes of the town who gets knocked up by the town doctor's son instead
it went to number six on the country chart and number <unk> on the billboard hot one hundred i would call that a hit song
after that aubrey <unk> put out an album consisting of everything he had sung by <unk> during her time with little <unk>
the album is called sock soul i'm guessing in reference to the line in harper valley p t a about how mrs johnson <unk> it to em
but this stuff was all recorded before anyone thought of <unk> c riley as the loudest voice calling b s on american society so none of the songs fit that album title or her image
the material is good it's just in the same vein being <unk> by every other female voice in country music
the price i pay to stay barely cracked the country top forty from there her singles were hit or miss if you judge them by commercial results
but even when she released a legitimate hit nobody saw it that way because it wasn't another harper valley p t a
her first proper single released after that little <unk> compilation of basically demo recordings was there never was a time
here's her doing it in <unk> cash show
that song was a top five country hit that also cracked the pop hot one hundred now listen to how great this other single list from the same album as that song the back side of dallas it wasn't a hit but it's a damn good song
up until the mid seventy the quality of her music remained pretty consistent here's her next top ten country girl
she was starting to branch away from the harper valley p t a prototype of getting on a microphone and pointing fingers at
society also letting <unk> <unk> her own harmony vocals was a great way to shut up the critics who liked to say she had no range as a singer
and of course most of these critics were pop writers who were only aware of <unk> c riley because of the pop success of harper valley p t a and whose only other frame of reference for country music in the sixties and seventies was probably johnny cash
like the l a times pop critic robert <unk> who reviewed a <unk> c riley concert in nineteen <unk> under the headline letter talent
quote <unk> c riley has all the confidence in the world but unfortunately very little of the talent
first of all her voice isn't any good second neither is her material that's two strikes against her and as soon as the public forgets harper valley p t a that's three strikes and she's out
now maybe that guy was having a bad day or something but he doesn't know what the hell he's talking about he's wrong on every single point from everything i've seen <unk> c riley was even better live than on recording
check out this performance of the song you heard just a little bit go back side of dallas
she always had a crack band behind her the harper valley express they usually made the tempo of everything faster to really put some gas in the tank and it's impossible to deny <unk> <unk> as a performer
the song she's singing is about a woman becoming a prostitute and her expressions alternate between sassy and serious in a way that keeps shifting the meaning of the lyrics
those charm school classes paid off she knew how to work a crowd striking poses and flashing twenty different kinds of smile in all the right places
but that l a times review of her concert is the sort of dismissive attitude the pop <unk> had towards southern culture
not only was <unk> not a <unk> wonder she made good albums with very little <unk> check out the album track from nineteen <unk> never even released as a single called without you
her voice is on the melody is there what more could you want from a country love song this is the kind of track you hope is waiting to surprise you when you buy someone's album based on one or two of the singles
without you is from <unk> second album on m g m after leaving plantation records in nineteen <unk> in what shelby singleton called a breach of contract
<unk> luck in the courtroom held winning this case as well though she maintained for the rest of her career that she was never paid what she believed she was owed for harper valley p t a earnings
her full commitment to christianity seems to have taken place sometime in the seventies
and seems to have caused at least some regret for her previous persona as country <unk> most blatant sex symbol to date the clothing changed the music took a turn to gospel and
this is purely speculation on my part but it looks to me like money could have really become a problem for her in the early nineteen eighties
that autobiography of hers was published in the year nineteen <unk> shortly before the release of a gospel album with the same title as the book
generally speaking when a musical artist quote-unquote past their prime puts out an album right after they put out a book
it's safe to assume that book is meant to generate new interest in that artist's music in advance of the new album
in other words it's often a promotional strategy if that's what happened here then the only problem is this book was printed by a small publisher of christian books
it may not be safe to assume that no major publishers were interested and that's why <unk> went with the small christian publisher
however it does seem very safe to assume that this small christian publishing house would mostly if not exclusively have a promotional network meant to get their product in front of conservative christians
a k a the exact opposite audience of the only reason anyone knows <unk> c <unk> name harper valley p t a a song highly critical of hypocrisy in social groups with hardcore conservative values
even the music fans who did find the book wouldn't be likely to recommend it to a friend because of how poorly it is written and how most of it is irrelevant to her career in music
people who bought the book because they happened to see it on one of their regular trips to the christian bookstore would no doubt be <unk> by <unk> rampant infidelity and the pot smoking
the used copy that i have once belonged to a library in new mexico it still has the stamp card in the back i can see here that only four people checked it out in nineteen <unk>
the year it was published one person in nineteen <unk> nobody in nineteen <unk> and one or two readers a year at best from there it was discarded in nineteen <unk>
having been checked out a grand total of thirteen times not good especially if that was the main plan to get people <unk> for that new gospel album
which entirely failed to chart if she had hopes of getting off the road where she seems to have been making most of her income from harper valley to the mountain top as a book album combo did not deliver
next move ask tom t hall to write another harper valley p t a a thing he'd been very vocal about his reluctance to do but also he's a big <unk>
it's easy to imagine him having a hard time saying no when <unk> came to him about it in nineteen <unk> tom wrote return to harper valley for her he even made all the lyrics fit <unk> new christian lifestyle
we're back at harper valley high because our <unk> grandchildren go to the school now and she's bought a ticket to the <unk> at a school dance she's wearing a dress that's well below her knees
because just about every character from the original song is now on the straight and narrow
but wouldn't you know it she spots a man giving a cigarette to a school kid and it turns out he's selling drugs in the parking lot there's the drummer of the band doing cocaine and these kids are all getting drunk and taking pills and taking off their clothes
she thinks about going home for her gun but instead decides to go home pray with her bible and you guessed it bring all this up at the next meeting of the harper valley p t a
in short the song is terrible nobody cared at all
even with tom joining <unk> for promo appearances on all the usual t v shows like nashville now
as you heard there seems to have been a sense of urgency in the writing recording and release of the song whatever the reason for the rush and even if bands of the original song had grown to develop more conservative values
there simply wasn't enough interest in this return to generate <unk> or sales figures
seven years later in nineteen <unk> <unk> put out what looks like will be her final formally released single here's to the cowboys
the entire review in billboard is one sentence riley gives a poignant reading of this tribute to cowboys who are committed enough to be domesticated
as some of you may have seen on fox news in two thousands and two somewhere along the line she apparently forgot that she worked with the guy who was probably responsible for creating the elvis is still alive rumors
thank you for listening to cocaine and <unk> this and every other episode of the podcast is written by me tyler <unk> <unk>

remember that every episode is converted into a full blog post on cocaine and <unk> dot com you could send your friend there to read the story and hey maybe someday that will give the podcast a chance but you're still listening to me talk right now
so i hope that means you did enjoy this one and i hope you're subscribed to the show wherever you listen a podcast because next week the harper valley p t a series is wrapping up with tom t hall
i love tom t hall based on how many people requested a tom t hall episode as soon as i went public with the show it's safe to say a lot of you do too
of course i had the whole first season written before i released an episode but i've got to say i was pretty surprised that tom t was such an instant demand from everyone i thought i was just making an episode about one of my favorite <unk>
so i'm excited for all you other tom t hall fans out there to get your ears on this one
i don't think i should put an ad in this episode for obvious reasons so what i'm gonna do is tell you about the other podcast i'm doing
the other podcast is called your favorite band sucks it's exactly what it sounds like it is you know it's it's a comedy podcast it's more like other podcasts than this one
cocaine and <unk> is very scripted very produced it takes me a long time to make these episodes your favorite band sucks is the exact opposite it's just my friend mark and i sit down and say some of the worst things you will ever hear about bands that you probably love
it should be available in itunes and everywhere by now or you can go listen to it at y f b as pot dot com
our first three episodes are out now we did an episode on the beatles an episode on the rolling stones
and an episode on christmas music
ah yeah enjoy it
all right here are the liner notes for <unk> c riley
i had no idea when i was in four when i began this episode and i'll tell you right now that i have no idea what the truth is here
just wow ah
i don't even know what i'm really allowed to say right now but i guess if i'm gonna get in trouble for this and i probably already crossed that line so ah
i know there are lies in this episode because i told you which ones i found out about but i have no idea what else is or isn't a lie
all i can tell you is that i did not knowingly perpetuate a lie when i'm reading a book i pretty much always save the previous and forward stuff until after i read the book
because there have been a few times reading some classic novel or something where the person writing the <unk> some scholar or someone assumes everyone must have already read this book before
and they drop <unk> boilers right there before you even read the first page so out of habit i just never read that stuff in the beginning of the book if the book's good i'll usually go back and read it or if i'm just like what the hell did i just read that i'll go back and read it
and that that second scenario was very much the case with <unk> c <unk> book by this second page of the book when she was putting those words and show we <unk> mouth and it just didn't seem like the way he talked to me
and it didn't make sense the way that she was having him act based on other information she was giving you at the same time i had feeling something was up
then a little bit later she's writing about having just married mickey while she's still in high school i'll just read it to you out of the book this is a quote
mickey and i move into a smaller apartment and struggled each month to make it on his salary we postpone going to nashville until i graduated from high school and we could save some money
i was at the doctor's office for a <unk> when he told me he thought i was pregnant in another month we'll know for sure he said okay end the quote
ah i didn't skip over anything there at all she writes a sentence about waiting to move to nashville until she graduates high school then the very next sentence is about her finding out she's pregnant
there's a four year gap between those two sentences i still have no idea why that gap is there but that's when i knew i was reading some bullshit
so after finishing the book i went back to read this stuff in the beginning and i found that disclaimer about the facts being altered
and that disclaimer is written by <unk> co-author who i also feel the mansion is a preacher here's what he writes quote to keep from hurting some of the folks <unk> loves we have changed the names of several people in the book
in one instinct we also changed the details slightly to purpose fully disguise a scene
only those who were involved will recognize what we have done but all the rest is true just as it happened when god picked up the harper valley girl and set her on a mountain top
okay even that disclaimer is so entirely bizarre the whole thing makes me wonder if this guy is even talking about inventing the character of phil <unk>
first of all they changed the named to protect people <unk> loves <unk> loves the person who <unk> her with revenge porn okay next in one instance we have changed the details slightly to disguise on scene
that is not at all and accurate description of full <unk> existence in this book there are many scenes that had a lot more than slight details changed
several they had do been completely fabricated anywhere in the book she talks about the first black rose single is a lie talking about meeting aubrey <unk> in las vegas
is a lie talking about getting out of a contract with phil <unk> to record with aubrey <unk>
is a lie it would take me ten minutes to list everything that is for sure a lie and it would probably take me an half an hour to list everything i suspect is a lie in this book
then still with this disclaimer the part of the end where he writes quote but all the rest is true and quote ah he wasn't there when all of this stuff happened so all by means is this is what she told me happened
and that really makes me wonder if <unk> came up with this whole phil <unk> story line on her own and tried to sell it to this guy as fact
maybe he figured out she was lying so this this disclaimer is his way of covering his own ass in case i don't know aubrey <unk> decided to sue the shit out of them
this is all obviously wild speculation on my part but at this point i'm not sure what other response i could possibly have did this pine of nonsense they attempt at <unk> the truth is so clumsy that it even presents another possibility
which is that they wanted people to figure out the truth and have it blow up into this big controversy to sell the book that certainly sounds like a business strategy someone might pick up from say working with shelby singleton
the only problem being that hardly anyone read this stupid book in the first place so that didn't happen there's so much other stuff in that autobiography that i didn't even get into
definitely do buy this book if you want to see a worst case example of a country singer autobiography
i hadn't yet been broken down enough by making this podcast to just start writing in the books i read or else whoever ends up with my copy of this one could have looked forward to some pretty intense <unk> all over it i'm sure
oh yeah by the way i am giving away the books that i read to make season one of this podcast cocaine and <unk> dot com slash give away for details on that you could end up with my copy of this book with a library card in the back and everything
a real piece of podcast history okay all of this deception aside i think we're starting to get an idea of how differently all the people involved can come out the other side of hits song
one thing that's really interesting that we heard today is unlike as you heard in the second episode of the podcast <unk> recording of the pill
the music establishment in nashville and everywhere else mostly just got on board with this song right away <unk> <unk> did say that the song sounded dirty and suggestive and some radio stations did ban it but who cares
i let you hear it from industry giants you heard johnny cash say it won a grammy award you heard roger miller i announced it as the c m a single of the year
sure the lyrics aren't scandal is at all compared to the pill but why do you think these two songs were received so differently by the old guard i know what i think
i thinks money talks i think that by the time any of those would be buzz kills started paying attention this song was already the number one pop song in america and it went number one pop before it went number one country
every major record label in nashville had been falling all over itself for fifteen years trying to do that they have made <unk> c riley the mayor of nashville if she did it a second time
her second single didn't get there but they let her hang around a while to see if it happened again it didn't and there is the story we end up with
ah by the way i could also get into a whole other ramble about nature versus nurture here you know is <unk> c riley quote unquote the way that she is now
because of everything that happened to her or was she always like that i honestly don't know after recording this episode i was checking one more thing and i found a people magazine interview from nineteen <unk>
that says <unk> was broken by the mid seventies so i was a little late on my guess when i said it looked like money problems were there in the early eighties but i was right
they were there if anyone care <unk> and mickey did <unk> after a super long who gives a shit will they won't they phase in that same people magazine article i just mentioned he's quoted as saying
quote she's a little crazy but she's just a good old country girl really unquote also after recording this episode i found out that <unk> c riley <unk> the l a times critic robert <unk> in her book
because of course she did also the review was from nineteen <unk> so it makes so much more sense knowing that it came from that time
then two years later in nineteen <unk> as <unk> stated in the book ah this is really aggravating for me to have to talk about right now because this is just my fault
this is my fault for not fact checking every minor detail of what i was using from a source that i knew was bad here's what robert actually wrote in his review
quote miss riley has all the confidence in the world on stage but unfortunately little of the talent
neither her voice nor most of her material largely drawn from her two albums is very good that is two strikes
the day the public forgets harper valley p t a may mean three unquote the difference between what is written there and what i quoted in the episode may seem so small as to not be noticeable by some of you but it's there and i do see it
my response in the episode to <unk> version of this review is <unk> than what it would been if i was reacting to the real review
so if robert <unk> happens to be listening to this i do apologize to you sir we may still disagree about something you wrote nearly forty years ago
but not nearly as strongly as i thought when reading and reacting to its second hand okay there are no more books to talk about as sources for this one
lots of good video clicks on cocaine and <unk> dot com so make sure to go watch those to get the full picture of some things i talked about come back next week we're putting this baby to bed it's the end of the harper valley p t a series
we're talking tom t hall on cocaine and <unk>
is it true that he is kind of a private and quiet like <unk> person when he is by himself
are you asking me or him
asking him if you want to weigh in too that's fine
he definitely is
that's <unk> edwards we were talking about her husband edwin edwards the former governor of louisiana
<unk> is almost <unk> and edwin will be <unk> in august
she was passing along my questions because he has a hard time hearing over the phone
is it true that you're a quiet kind of <unk> person when you're not in public when you're home by yourself
well i'm a very different person when i'm not on the stage
this the way i am um um i'm very quiet and private and i don't drink at all
i don't use drugs at all and so now most fun i have in life is taking care of my <unk> child
and my wife
okay
<unk> is <unk> third wife
they've been married since two thousand and eleven
the two of them met when she started writing him letters and federal prison
edwards served eight years on corruption charges
he was convicted of rigging casino licenses during his final term as governor
when he got out he and <unk> brought their relationship to reality t v
their show went off the air after eight episodes
since then edwards has run for congress and lost and he's had a couple of health scares
but he still has a remarkable command of louisiana political history much of which he shaped during his four terms as governor
to understand david duke you need to understand what makes louisiana politics distinctive
the unique alliances the entrenched corruption and the charismatic figures who've <unk> the state and their own images
and edwin edwards is louisiana politics <unk>
<unk> first <unk> campaign began in nineteen <unk>
first of all i spoke french and then in nineteen <unk> there were still people all the people in louisiana who understood english but they prefer to hear and speak in french
so ah <unk> french accent it helped me with that particular group of people
i mean he had a coalition a distinctly louisiana coalition he had <unk> and blacks
that's marc <unk> he worked with edwards as the state legislator and as the mayor of new orleans
in louisiana if you can put those two voting bases together in those days it was an <unk> coalition
unlike most of his white democratic peers edwards was an <unk> civil rights champion
he invited black <unk> to work in government positions and helped to craft a state constitution that outlawed discrimination
he also made louisiana richer
as governor edwards helped change how crude oil got taxed
moving from a flat fee per barrel to a percentage of the barrel price when oil prices shut up state revenues soared
so did edwin edwards his popularity
story is about <unk> gambling and <unk> didn't hurt him with voters
the <unk> of corruption and scandal that hung over his administration didn't damage him either
there were six grand jury investigations during <unk> first term
but he wasn't indicted in any of those cases
it seemed like the silver <unk> silver <unk> governor could talk his way out of anything
when asked about some <unk> political donations edwards said it was illegal for them to give but not for me to receive
edwards led louisiana for eight years leaving office in march nineteen eighty
the only thing stopping him from being governor for life for term limits that edwards himself had pushed for
so he went on a brief <unk> sitting out the next election cycle then returning in nineteen <unk> to reclaim his throne
in the last days of that campaign edwards fired off his most famous one liner
the only way i could lose this election is if i got caught in bed with a dead girl or alive boy
and that took on a life of its own and has been quoted many times since by other people
is that good enough or
ah yeah thank you <unk> does he regret saying that or is he happy that he said it
i guarantee you he doesn't regret anything he's ever done hold on
do you regret saying that or are you happy you said that
no um i ah it's one of the things that i said that ah people identify with me and i thought it was kind of funny
edwards was right to believe that nineteen <unk> election was a lock he'd win it with <unk> percent of the vote
to celebrate his victory he did something audacious even by edwin edwards standards
if there's one thing louisiana governor elect edwin edwards knows it's how to have a good time even with a four million dollar campaign deficit staring him down
edwards chartered two <unk> jets announced he was going to paris and invited anyone willing to contribute ten thousand dollars to come on along
more than six hundred people joined edwards on that trip to france which was touted as the largest single political fundraiser ever thrown by an american politician
the writer roy <unk> junior on assignment for people magazine went along for the ride
you know the whole deal did not smell of righteousness
that's for sure but as some people said it's hard to be proper and have a real good time
the french speaking edwards and his crew of <unk> eight high class cuisine at the palace of <unk>
the governor also received a warm greeting from a nun outside notre dame cathedral
and she gave him what she described as a french kiss which was actually of course more like a <unk> kiss
but she could take a joke and so he said okay sister but just don't let me get into the habit
and all of his supporters gathered round cheered and beamed
and that's the kind of thing they had come to paris for
the party ended for edwin edwards as soon as those <unk> jets landed back in louisiana
the campaign of <unk> was great it was one of the finest experiences of my life
the service in the governor's office from <unk> to <unk> it was not
it was it was a a very difficult experience
that said <unk> he was edwin <unk> assistant
by the mid nineteen eighties oil and gas revenues had <unk> and the state was facing a huge deficit
edwards tried to fill that hole with tax increases
his constituents didn't find that <unk> or charming
you know when you're trying to raise taxes on people who are really struggling already it's a very precarious political situation to be in
so this tax package was probably the beginning of his <unk>
in february nineteen <unk> edwin edwards is run of bad luck
got a whole lot worse
the fifty count federal indictment charges governor edwards and six others including his brother and a nephew
with <unk> and fraud and a <unk> dollar scheme involving the effective sale of state approval for a medical facility construction projects
edwards was accused basically of accepting bribes to steer state money to his friends
the trial dragged on somehow for fourteen weeks
<unk> spent most of it on a pay phone outside the new orleans courtroom
i was constantly calling the governor's office in baton rouge and getting the phone messages
and returning those phone calls and explaining to people under the circumstances you know the governor can't talk to you right this minute
and um we tried to be as diplomatic about it as we could
and of course most people knew where he was and what he was going through but they'd call anyway
the case ended in a <unk> edwards was later <unk> and found not guilty
when that verdict came in the prosecutor said if we didn't make him honest i hope we made him sorry
when i asked edwards about the case he didn't sound all that sorry
that was an example of a of ah of a stupid prosecutor ah who didn't know anything about what's happened
did it bother him when people said he was profiting from his role as the governor
did it bother you when people said you were profiting from your role as governor
no because
there's no truth to it so it didn't bother me at all i ah i i just laughed about it
edwards may have been laughing but he was still in a precarious spot
in good times most people in louisiana loved his <unk>
but these weren't good times the boom years of the <unk> were long gone
in nineteen <unk> louisiana was ready for a change
i notice my opponents don't make many people angry
that doesn't surprise you does it politics as usual
i don't like louisiana politics i love louisiana
i love louisiana enough to make some people angry
buddy <unk> was a congressman from north louisiana
in the last four weeks of the nineteen <unk> governor's race he <unk> from fifth to first in the polls <unk> by <unk> t v ads and a string of newspaper endorsements
<unk> led edwards by five percentage points after the first round of voting
setting the stage for a runoff but when edwards emerged after one a m to greet his supporters he made a move that nobody had anticipated
and i have determined that under the circumstances since i did not run first
that it would be inappropriate for me to continue this election
supporters were stunned some of this family cried
he's sixty he's been governor twelve years
he said that's long enough most voters thought so too
there would be no runoff <unk> would be the next governor of louisiana
and edwin edwards he looked to outside observers like his career was finished
but that's not how edwards saw it dropping out of the race that was the first step in his comeback plan
i spoke with him that night and he he was absolutely resolute that oh look you know i'm gonna let him have it
i'm gonna turn it over time he's been going all over this state saying he's gonna fix this he's gonna fix that
and he's gonna <unk> you mark my word
edwards had it all mapped out he would let <unk> run the state for a few difficult years then <unk> to save the day
it wouldn't be that simple the nineteen <unk> election would be about a lot more than who got to sleep in the governor's mansion
it would be a fight over what louisiana was and what it should be
and edwin edwards and buddy <unk> wouldn't be the only ones in that battle
in nineteen <unk> david duke was at the height of his powers
he'd honed his message built a rabid fan base and come shockingly close to getting elected to the u s senate
the governor's race would be the culmination of his life's work
this was duke's chance to turn his words into actions to take control of an entire state and make it into whatever he wanted
this is slow burn i'm josh levine episode five the road to hell

when edwin edwards was three years old the governor of louisiana had a man kidnapped
it was nineteen thirty and the governor was <unk> long
the guy who got snatched was about to expose rampant graft in state government
four days after he disappeared the victim <unk> to say not at all <unk> that he staged the <unk> himself
in a radio broadcast the man announced that governor <unk> long was his best friend in the world
long was shot and killed at the state capital five years later
a lot of people in louisiana will tell you that he was the best friend the state ever had
yes long was a corrupt dictator and sure he orchestrated a <unk>
but he also built bridges and hospitals and paid for it all with money he <unk> free from the big oil companies
edwin edwards carried on <unk> long tradition of economic populism
like long edwards use money snatched from big oil to build bridges and hospitals
all that and he finished construction of the louisiana <unk>
david duke on the other hand said he wouldn't follow <unk> example
we need another populist not a populist like <unk> long for more government but a populist for the state of louisiana for less government and more power to the people thank you very much
in reality duke's brand of populism had nothing to do with shrinking government
it was built on racial resentment
duke's message the journalist john <unk> wrote held a lot of appeal for the children and grandchildren of <unk> <unk> old voters
i doubt the duke cared one way or the other about <unk> policies but he did respect the man's power and fame and reference it to make a point about his own celebrity
the ladies that do the tours the state capital not far from here they always tell me they say you know there's two things people want to see when they come the state capitol in baton rouge
they want to see where <unk> long was shot and where david duke says
buddy <unk> offered voters a third option a complete break from the <unk> and <unk> that had marred louisiana politics from the long era to the present day
the harvard educated <unk> said that <unk> legacy was something for nothing
somebody else pays
<unk> promised a new era of responsibility one that would earn his home state national respect
he called this the <unk> revolution
most people in america will never come to louisiana most people in america will know us only by our reputation
i'll put louisiana first and we'll make them stop laughing and start listening
<unk> big initiative was a plan to modernize the state's approach to taxation
one day early and with votes to spare tax reform finally made it through the louisiana legislature
we're talking a new way of approaching our old problems that are eating us alive
<unk> was adamant that his fiscal reform plan was not a tax increase
he said it would just shift more of the burden to people with higher incomes
in the spring of nineteen <unk> he made that pitch to <unk> voters who needed to approve the proposal in a statewide referendum
david duke then a newly elected state legislator was one of the governor's most outspoken critics
overall it's a six hundred and twenty-five million dollar tax increase and this from a governor who swore to us he would not raise taxes
i i i'm gonna ignore david duke
i mean i don't care what the american nazi party thinks about this program
a lot of people in louisiana did care what david duke had to say
duke staged a series of rallies across the state railing against <unk> and presenting himself as the champion of the working class
at one event a louisiana <unk> tea party he climbed aboard a <unk> and tossed some tea into the mississippi river
you don't raise taxes in a recession duke said
you don't tax your way into prosperity
the blues on the streets of new orleans are now being sung in the governor's mansion after voters <unk> rejected new taxes
digging <unk> already troubled economy ever deeper in debt and forcing reform minded governor buddy <unk> to scramble his way out of a new financial crisis
as of may nineteen <unk> the <unk> revolution was pretty much dead
later that year <unk> wife patty left him when the political consultant raymond <unk> visited <unk> in early nineteen <unk>
the governor was still in a deep funk
he said i'm glad to see you i need your help
he said i need to write a letter to patty
i know i've made some mistakes but he said i want her to come home he said help me write this letter you're a good writer
<unk> said that he wasn't the man for that job
his own wife had just left him a few weeks earlier
but <unk> who'd helped <unk> win in nineteen <unk> was available to work on the governor's re-election campaign
he said move move into the mansion and i did
and it was nice you know you have a dry cleaners downstairs and you put your shoes outside the door every night and they come to start the next day <unk>
and every night when i go to my room there'll be a pitcher of milk and ice and some still warm cookies
how good were the cookies
the cookies were splendid ah
they were baked every afternoon and sometimes again just before breakfast
so i always had fresh cookies that probably gained ten pounds i was already fat so
apart from the cookies <unk> has no fond memories of working on <unk> re-election
the first big conflict came when a new <unk> rumor advisor named danny walker suggested that the governor wear a rubber band around his wrist
and he said well every time you have a bad thought if you pop that rubber band and cause a little pain pretty soon you won't be having bad thoughts
i said you keep your damn rubber bands yourself danny
<unk> actually liked the rubber band idea
the governor also embraced robert <unk> book
all i really need to know i learned in kindergarten which touted the virtues of sharing everything and playing fair
but he was into that guru sort of stuff <unk> <unk>
i can't stand that kind of thing
after reading that self-help guide the governor decided he'd been too <unk>
in his state of the state address <unk> apologized to the legislature for his <unk> and <unk>
let's say good bye to me and hello to we
let's say good bye to lines in the same
for <unk> the self-help stuff was bad but what happened next was worse
one day at the mansion he happened upon a meeting that he wasn't supposed to know about
i saw mary <unk> a whole bunch of high <unk> republicans sitting around a table with bud by the dining room table with buddy
and i said oh my god
<unk> had always been conservative
as a congressman he tended to vote with republican president ronald reagan and against his own democratic party
but <unk> says <unk> had always assured him he wouldn't move to the g o p
he broke that promise in march nineteen <unk>
<unk> explained himself at a press conference outside the white house where president george h w bush had just welcomed him into the republican fold
i would say the party is not the most important thing in american families are integrity ideals commitment principles
those are more important and on those issues i never change
but when it comes to political action i will be a republican and proudly walk in the park
<unk> was the first sitting governor in modern american history to switch parties
ideology aside <unk> thought the move was smart strategy
edwin edwards was going to grab votes from his left no matter what
<unk> figured that branding himself a republican would help stave off right wing <unk> who might threaten his re-election
the statewide polls showed that the top three candidates are duke edwards and myself
and the last poll i was in the <unk> edwards in the thirties
and duke ten eleven or twelve with some undecided i felt good about the politics
raymond <unk> did not feel good about the politics
it was a dumb move for him and me it was just a dumb move
democrats in louisiana felt burned by <unk> and republicans including state party officials weren't sure they could trust him either
billy <unk> the republican chair who'd undercut the effort to censure david duke
resented that <unk> hadn't included him in discussions about the party switch and <unk> forgetting the lessons of all i ever needed to know i learned in kindergarten cursed out <unk> rather than trying to appease him
the louisiana republicans made their endorsement in the governor's race at a state convention in june nineteen <unk>
that endorsement wouldn't go to buddy <unk> or david duke
the g o <unk> choice was a pro-life congressman named <unk> holloway the preferred candidate of the christian coalition
<unk> knowing that he wouldn't get endorsed didn't bother to show up at the convention
but duke and his supporters made their presence known
here's how the <unk> activist beth rickey described the scene in nineteen <unk>
it was like a duke convention they were just <unk> <unk> anything and everybody and they were just wild and they were
then duke was <unk> them on you know to disrupt things
they had to sing dixie to quiet them down quite literally they tried god bless america
ah and ah the battle hymn of the republic but it wasn't until i say saying i wish i were in the land of cotton that the ah hush fell over the convention
buddy <unk> had tried to consolidate the conservative vote
that plan had been a total failure
the <unk> of the louisiana republican party would be a gift to edwin edwards and to david duke
let's take a quick break
now it's the time to catch upon the podcast you've always wanted to listen to
and so many of them are available on <unk>

one of their new shows is murder on the <unk>
it's a <unk> true crime mini series
host by award <unk> journalist <unk> o'brien
murder on the <unk> explores the nineteen <unk> murder of mary <unk> meyer
in the neighborhood of georgetown in washington d c
her death resulted in a trail that rock the country
and became a time capsule of all the racial tension scandal and distrust of the nineteen sixties
it remains one of the most fascinating unsolved cases in u s history

no other state does elections like louisiana
the credit for that or the blame belongs to edwin edwards
the first time he ran for governor edwards had to compete in three separate races
a close democratic primary a democratic runoff and then the general election
in the days when democrats dominated louisiana that last race against the republican also ran was a pointless nuisance
it was like winning the hundred meter dash at the olympics then having to <unk> a kid pulled from the stands to get your gold medal
and i i didn't like that idea i said well look let's change it
everybody qualifies at the same time regardless of party ah affiliation
and everybody votes for anybody he or she wishes regardless of registration
<unk> open primary system went into effect in nineteen seventy-five
edwards <unk> to re-election that year as the republican party didn't even field a candidate
but in the reagan years the g o p surged throughout the south
by nineteen <unk> the open primary was open in a way edwards maybe hadn't anticipated
it was a true two party free for all
political writer john <unk> had a name for the showdown between david duke edwin edwards and buddy <unk>
i call this the the race from hell
you have ah three very angry men ah candidates for governor and the people aren't too happy either
in the beginning the race from hell wasn't exactly <unk>
one reason for that was a package of campaign finance reforms part of buddy <unk> good government agenda
the new law limited individual contributions to five thousand dollars and major statewide races
banned cash contributions of more than a hundred dollars and required that small cash donations be reported
duke could pass the bucket with impunity during his nineteen ninety senate campaign because that was a federal race
but thanks to <unk> the revolutionary <unk> guidelines on cash giving were now stricter than the nation's
<unk> by these new rules duke held fewer rallies as a candidate for governor than when he ran for the senate and <unk> fundraising slowed to a trickle
he'd raised sixteen million dollars during the nineteen <unk> governor's race
in the nineteen <unk> primary he brought in a little more than one million dollars
and buddy <unk> he preferred staying in to going out to meet his public
<unk> had always been like this
raymond <unk> saw it up close during the nineteen <unk> race
he was sitting back to campaign headquarters and read novels usually mystery novels and he wouldn't go out and campaign
we'd go to a restaurant to eat lunch and he would sit in the back the restaurant in the corner with his back to the room
so nobody would see him and recognize him and come over and start talking
<unk> charismatic <unk> routine had worked out fine in nineteen <unk>
and it seemed possible he could pull off the same trick in nineteen <unk>
michelle showers started volunteering for the <unk> campaign when she was still in college at louisiana tech then got a job on staff right after graduation
she says when the governor did make public appearances early on he seemed totally energized
and he literally walked into the room you know pushing both doors open
good afternoon everybody great to see you
you know he was clapping and smiling and really exuberant
and it was really very exciting to be in a room with him
he was just really engaging the crowd
and i would say for the first part of the campaign that's the way he was he really came into room and made it alive
the problem for <unk> was that a lot of swing voters felt drawn to another candidate
at first <unk> liked the focus group results he was hearing
blue collar democrats said they couldn't stand a hypothetical candidate with all of david duke's characteristics
but then as soon as i learned it was david duke they'd say well that's what politicians do or
well you know if ah k k k
well he was a young man and a nazi well he was a young guy
college kids do stupid stuff you know whatever it was they'd make an excuse for him
while <unk> struggled to hold his coalition together duke was finding a new way to expand his appeal
it's been tough for me sometimes over last couple of years a lot of media attacks but was made us made it better for me is that i'm a christian
i work hard i believe in christ and i'm gonna keep on fighting for you and for the future louisiana
thank you very much
duke invoked his christianity far more in the governor's race than in any of his previous campaigns
he used religion as both a shield and a sword
at a debate in september duke said that he'd repented for his past sins and those who tried to discredit him were being <unk>
i've certainly been intolerant before my life
but those who condemn and point their fingers at me i'd like them to look in their own lives and ask if they'd never hurt a friend or change their opinions
it wasn't clear based on polling how white people in louisiana were responding to duke's latest attempt at image management
susan <unk> had been struggling for years to get a handle on duke's voters
<unk> was a professor of political science at the university of new orleans
she'd taken her first look at duke during his run for the state house when his opponent john <unk> hired her to do a phone survey
<unk> poll in the primary had duke at seven percent she was off by <unk> points
and i was stunned and then um john <unk> stood up on a table and he was stunned too and
i remember him saying the people of <unk> are not racist
and i thought well maybe we should <unk> that
<unk> fired <unk> after the primary so she'd have to wait to pull another due grace
but she had a pretty good idea of what was going on with his supporters
people were reluctant to say i'm gonna vote for duke because they were afraid of being labeled racist even though they're talking to it you know um on an anonymous phone call to a pollster
it's like people are reluctant to say how much alcohol they drank or were they ever arrested
this became a research challenge for <unk> and her graduate students how could they get david duke silent army to break its silence
we came up with some alternate i would call <unk> indirect questions to identify someone who might be sympathetic to duke
um one of them which actually worked pretty well in increasing the duke support in the poll was to ask people if they approve or disapprove of the martin luther king holiday
<unk> conducted a survey one month before the <unk> primary
respondents were asked who they were voting for and also how they felt about statements like if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites
the raw numbers showed that thirty-five percent of people were voting for buddy <unk> thirty percent for edwin edwards and twelve percent for david duke
but when <unk> accounted for her <unk> indirect questions support for <unk> and edwards dipped and duke's support doubled
given the margin of error the election was too close to call
that's how things look from the outside on the inside there was gossip about a possible secret alliance in the governor's race
<unk> political consultant raymond <unk> heard that speculation
the rumor that we heard was that edwin edwards was encouraging and perhaps funding david duke
edwards wanted revenge on buddy <unk> after losing to him in nineteen <unk> but edwards also knew how to play the odds
he was smart enough the theory went to sense that he'd have a better shot against an ex <unk> than against the incumbent governor
ah nobody had any proof whatsoever
but i seldom ran in anybody on either side who didn't think that edwards was playing funny with david duke
when i got edwards on the phone
i asked if there was any truth to all that chatter
did he or his supporters do anything to help duke make the runoff
like either giving him money or or <unk> him up in some way
did you or your supporters do anything to help duke get into the run off with you
no i didn't i i didn't do that because i didn't think it was necessary and i would've maybe got caught and so i didn't do that
i just let it run his race i ran mine <unk> ran his
and that's as far as i got chasing down that rumor
but i did learn something else
the edwards campaign it turns out had a totally different secret alliance
<unk> holloway was the pro-life congressman who'd gotten the official endorsement of the louisiana republican party
instead of <unk> <unk> he was way back in the polls in a distant fourth and needed cash to air commercials
one of edwin edwards his closest friends
new one of <unk> campaign advisers
to him <unk> says the two of them hatched a plan
he would ah show me results of a tracking poll which how people confirm that every vote declined
holloway was receiving or getting was coming directly off the sitting governor buddy <unk>
and we would have people that were <unk> out or have a lot of money to support
and when edwards asked what else they could do so we get these commercials on t v or radio
i said that would help us possibly get in the second primary would david duke rather than a sitting governor
to him <unk> is describing an electoral double bank shot
edwards supporters send money to holloway
holloway takes votes from <unk>
<unk> slides out of the runoff and duke slides in
we felt that we could be um david duke um substantially and um <unk> would be a different results
ah polling at the time so it would've been tied
did governor edwards know about this strategy
yes i i informed him that was this that ah was going on and his answer was be careful
when i asked edwards about the alliance he told me he didn't know anything about it
in john <unk> book about the nineteen <unk> campaign <unk> <unk> campaign advisor brian wagner also denied making any such deal
wagner died in two thousand eighteen
that's sad i believed him <unk> story
to be clear none of this would have been illegal assuming the campaign contributions got reported
but it was kind of <unk> a way to help david duke without giving him direct support
i don't want to make this alliance seem more important than it was
those <unk> adds were just a small drop in an enormous bucket of campaign spending
in the final days of the race the owner of a hazardous waste recycling company spent a massive amount of money on anti <unk> commercials cause he was angry about the governor's environmental regulations
that <unk> was a huge deal
the <unk> adds really weren't
but it's still telling that the edwards campaign was willing to take active measures to help duke get into the runoff
i think it is very typical of edwin edwards
that's <unk> <unk> he was one of <unk> most prominent <unk> republicans
he also thinks edwards is totally corrupt
here's what he had to say about the edwards <unk> alliance
i'm not saying it's immoral it's just <unk> completely without regard to the morality of trying to help david duke get into the runoff and whether or not that would be good or bad for the state of louisiana
it certainly was playing every political angle and it was edwin edwards and his people at their edwin edwards just
this was in some ways typical louisiana <unk>
politics is sport with a win at all costs mentality
but duke wasn't a typical candidate
maybe the edwards camp was right that their odds were better against duke than <unk>
but what if they were wrong what if david duke won
we'll be back in a minute
i want to tell you about another podcast i think you'll love deep cover the drug wars
it's a true story that begins with a detroit f b i agent going undercover in an outlaw motorcycle gang
and ends with a u s invasion of a foreign country
pulitzer <unk> journalist jake <unk> guides listeners on this wild journey of marijuana <unk> and men
it's perfect for fans of <unk> sons of anarchy or anything by the cohen brothers
you can hear it now on apple podcast or wherever you listen brought to you by <unk> industries
in january nineteen <unk> david duke had been a bit player a second tier candidate in a small suburban race
now almost three years later he was a star and a <unk>
his election night party was a celebration of how far he'd come and how close he was to winning the state's biggest prize
oh you wanna know i got those <unk> over my shirt
no big deal i have those <unk> on my face if i didn't have to see
on october nineteenth nineteen <unk> duke's fans gathered at the <unk> center in his home territory of jefferson parish
they were treated to a short performance by that blonde woman in the blue dress who sang at lots of duke's rallies
after <unk> came a prayer
we ask that you guide our leaders and that they might govern with compassion and love and understanding
we ask a special blessing up on this assembly
and that which is done here will be ultimately to the glory of the kingdom of god
and then david duke himself took the stage
with every minute ladies and gentlemen it appears that we will be in a runoff for the <unk> of louisiana in new <unk>
back in nineteen <unk> at duke's first victory party he'd shouted about winning a state house seat without any big political endorsements
he'd also complained about the media and the political establishment and whined that he was always getting lied about
in nineteen <unk> he didn't sound bitter or vengeful
this david duke was smooth humble <unk>
he figured out how he was supposed to sound and how to make an appeal that wasn't entirely based on grievance
my thanks goes first to the forest in my life that's giving me strength then help me
withstand a lot and continue to stand up for you
and that's jesus christ ladies and gentlemen i support
david duke was in the runoff with thirty-two percent of the vote
duke finished just two points behind the leader
edwin edwards buddy <unk> political consultant raymond <unk> knew his man was gonna come in third
he went to bed at the governor's mansion before the race got called
and the next morning i got up i went down to get my cookies and milk
and buddy was down there and he said well you didn't have a good candidate did you
i said must not have buddy
he said well we took our best shot and he walked out that's last time i've ever spoken to him
buddy <unk> finished five points behind david duke
ultimately he wasn't taken down by an electoral conspiracy
he'd lost because louisiana didn't want a reformer
and tonight the people spoke and they said buddy thanks but she didn't do enough and i think that's fair
when michelle <unk> started working on the campaign she'd been inspired by buddy <unk> energy
but now that it was over <unk> thought <unk> actually seemed relieved
she found her own feelings harder to pin down
she was thinking about leaving the state maybe going to live with her parents in montana
but then she got approached by some people she knew from the louisiana republican party
they said we have an offer for you before you reject it outright
just listen to us and they said you could go to work on david duke's campaign
and of course my eyes widen like are you crazy
<unk> had never considered supporting david duke much less working for him
her family had been on government aid when she was growing up so his <unk> against welfare weren't persuasive
but <unk> really didn't want edwin edwards back in charge of louisiana
plus those people from the state party told her that she didn't need to take a public facing role
that she could stay in the shadows
<unk> agreed to meet with duke's campaign manager <unk> farrell
when they got together he said that the time had come to broaden the duke operation by bringing in people from the establishment
<unk> wanted to be a campaign manager someday
and she liked the idea of learning from one she was also unemployed
so from my perspective i had a job and an opportunity to look at an alternate campaign and that's how i started
during her stint as a duke <unk> michelle <unk> would hear things that shocked her
she'd also make a lot of phone calls on behalf of david duke using a list she brought with her from the <unk> campaign
that list was the main reason the duke campaign had hired <unk>
<unk> supporters were now up for grabs if they voted republican in the november runoff
then david duke was going to be the governor of louisiana
the state republican party was still not going to support duke publicly but he was the last republican standing
and when <unk> talked to her friends in the party they said they knew how to keep duke under control
when i would have those discussions they would say you know there's not much he can do
he's gonna have so many eyes on him if he wins
there's so many eyes we're gonna have people around him
he won't be able to push forward any of these ah agendas from his past
he'll have to stick to the policies
um and at that time i believed them
and at that time i thought well i wasn't really willing to say i was for him i was more for sweeping and a republican governor to try to fix things in louisiana
that's really where i was coming from at that time

thanks for listening
hello everyone i'm stephen west this is <unk> this thank you to everyone that continues to support the show on patreon and a special thank you to those you the up your pledge during these uncertain times
i'm beyond grateful and i'm not gonna take up anymore your time today's episode is on the political philosophy of richard <unk> i hope you love the show today
so if you were having a political discussion with someone and the conversation took a turn and all sudden you guys are talking about human rights
there's certainly a lot of different angles you could approach that discussion from but one of the most common ones might be what philosophical grounding can we give to something like human rights
i mean we all think human beings have rights but where exactly do those rights come from who or what out there guarantees these rights for people
well a common answer to this question might be that human rights are inherited by birthright simply by virtue of being born every human being is entitled to certain natural rights or <unk> rights
rights that protect the dignity of a human life at such a basic level that to go against them starts to seem like you'd be going against nature
now as far as the philosophical grounding is concerned this is an attitude much more common during the beginning of the enlightenment than it is today
and the two main thinkers that took on this position are often cited to be john locke and <unk> kant
when it comes to answering the question of who or what guarantees these human rights john locke goes in the direction of god you know we are endowed by our creator with certain <unk> rights
and kant goes more in the direction of a <unk> fact derived from reason but either way these thinkers are in their own way trying to use reason to arrive at a universal that guarantees human beings are born with natural rights
little did either of these thinkers know that just a hundred and forty years later we would be immersed in two world wars that would make the argument for the natural rights of human beings seem about as important as neck ruffles were to them
see as we've talked about on this show the early twentieth century was full of thinkers dissatisfied with what the enlightenment had produced they even went so far as to say that the entire project of the enlightenment was destined to consume itself from the start
yeah sure at the beginning reason calls into question much of the religious dogma of the middle ages but what inevitably has to happen once it gets done with that job is reason has to start questioning the new foundations for things
reason has to start questioning itself which then leads to philosophers using the process of <unk> to find out that <unk> is not some unbiased a historical measuring tool
it's not some neutral point from which we can make unambiguous claims about the truth of human rights or more importantly the universe to the thinker we're gonna be talking about today richard <unk>
people like locke and kant were no more discovering a truth about what grounds human rights than <unk> was before them
but unlike many of the thinkers of the early twenties century who may have felt a bit disenfranchised by the rational process richard <unk> felt optimistic about <unk>
some people called <unk> a <unk> which would usually place him in staunch opposition to anything that even sounds like the word enlightenment
like excitement but let me tell you <unk> was a very exciting man he rejected the title of <unk> and most titles for that matter
he operated in a very unique realm for a thinker where like a typical <unk> he didn't believe in any sort of grand narrative that could explain away the universe
but yet he was still a die hard card carrying fan of the project of the enlightenment overall
see in a world where there are so many twentieth century thinkers hating on the enlightenment here is a guy some people viewed as a <unk> coming to its defense
let me explain why he even do something like this
when <unk> kant in his famous essay describes the enlightenment as man's removal of his <unk> <unk> yeah he's talking about the <unk> of the religious dogma of the past
but <unk> would extend that <unk> to the rational dogma that was to come in the future because of how <unk> we were at the beginning of the enlightenment about what <unk> could produce
the spirit of the enlightenment to <unk> was not to use reason to arrive at the truth about the universe
it was ultimately a call to <unk> traditional forms of authority the significance of the enlightenment was not to land on new answers
it was to question old assumptions so in that sense yeah the initial project of the enlightenment ultimately consumed itself
but to richard <unk> the initial project of the enlightenment was meant to consume itself thinkers like isaiah berlin that would come along and suggest a pluralistic vision of things
this wasn't an <unk> idea at all to <unk> this was the project of the enlightenment left to play itself out
thinkers like berlin were always going to eventually come along
see the project of the enlightenment maturing through people like isaiah berlin taught us a couple of extremely valuable insights
one of which was that we don't need to try to use reason to appeal to some ultimate authority or universal to ground our ideas
<unk> is not a tool that gets us to objectivity about things
but it may get us a very effective mix of <unk> between cultures
<unk> wants to offer an alternative way of looking at the legacy of the enlightenment
maybe it is pointless to try to do our best impressions of locke and kant and try to access the universe through reason
but when it comes to strictly human institutions for example the political realm where we're not trying to access things in themselves
we're just trying to figure out how we can live together the best maybe that is where <unk> thrives as a method
what all this is alluding to is the fact that human rights are not the only things philosophers have tried to ground in <unk> in the past
the very structure of some political systems liberalism for example has also historically been grounded in <unk>
once again i just want to clarify because there are some people out there that get angry very quickly
and they also must be part of some sort of email club that's out there
when we're talking about liberalism as a foundation for society we're talking about a government with a focus on individual rights consent to the governed and aversion to any sort of <unk> system or systems that were popular at other points in history maybe a caste system for example
now you can imagine if you're a philosopher and you're trying to make a case for liberalism being better than a caste system
might be tempting to start to make an argument that human beings at the level of the universe are all equal and therefore should not be relegated to different ranks within a society
but to <unk> this would be making the same mistake that locke and kant made in our example from before about human rights
the fact is to <unk> we don't need that sort of ultimate foundation to be able to make a case for the fact that liberalism is how we should be running things
for many different reasons one like we already said we can't actually access the universe at that level through <unk>
two society is just far better off when it can base public policy on the rational consensus of individual citizens rather than a philosophical theory arrived at by some guy in a tower that people might not even be able to relate to
think of the limitations you instantly place on yourself if you decide that every public policy or value of a society needs to be grounded in some philosophical justification that tells you how human beings are at large
first of all let's say you decided to structure your society around the political philosophy of plato
you're soon going to find yourself on a constant p r campaign trying to continually sell these ideas to a population just crossing your fingers that they go along with it
second of all almost always these philosophical ideas that you might structure your society around were created in an entirely different culture that emerged out of an entirely different history
which means these theories can bring a lot of baggage along with them that you may not want in the present culture
thirdly you are always going to be fighting a sort of losing battle to <unk> because you will always be trying to cram one interpretation of how human life should be structured into the enormously complex pluralistic <unk> of people <unk> together
<unk> is essentially saying maybe we don't need the philosopher up in the tower thinking all day telling us how to structure our societies because well i've decided it shores up with how the universe is
maybe we don't have access to the way the universe is but maybe that doesn't matter maybe we don't need some elaborate philosophical theory to structure our society for us maybe a strategy is legitimate
liberalism for instance if the citizens of a particular culture positioned in history at a particular time and place all the citizens facing a very specific set of common problems that they need to solve
maybe a strategy is legitimate if the people of that society decide that they have confidence in it because one thing for sure one ultimate theory is not good enough
<unk> who was a huge fan of isaiah berlin sometimes talks in his work about the quote fact of pluralism
this is what a society is to <unk> we are worse off as a society if we try to use a single religious or philosophical theory to justify our political strategy
you will always be fighting a losing battle people will always arrive at a bunch of different conclusions
so instead of <unk> on a never ending sales campaign for an idea <unk> suggests that we allow our political strategy to reflect the common values of the people that make up the culture
you writes about how if we do this and we're careful eventually if you were having that same conversation at the beginning of the episode and you asked somebody what grounds human rights
the common tendency won't be to try to appeal to something written into the universe or to cite some religious or philosophical justification you read in a book somewhere
the new standard will be for people to see social policy as legitimate if it was approved by the people actually living in the culture
when asked the question what grounds this piece of social policy the answer won't involve pointing to some philosopher from three hundred years ago
you know descartes famous work a treatise concerning why drugs should be legalized and why you should be able to use your cellphone on an airplane no no
the authority lies in the hands of the set of people positioned in history with a very specific set of problems to solve that they care about
and once again to <unk> not only do we not need any more authority than that we don't have access to any authority other than that and we're better off this way anyway
should be said this is yet another way we can access an answer to the question of how we can find a bridge between nature and culture
<unk> obviously is not appealing to a single theory but he also is not appealing to pure <unk> or <unk>
his answers to these questions about how we can justify our political strategy place him in what i think is the most accurate category to describe some of his biggest ideas
<unk> is often thought of as a <unk> and i think we can understand <unk> overall position a little bit better if we take a second to talk about the concept of truth
more specifically the key differences between the traditional ways people have viewed the concept of truth and the way a <unk> like <unk> would've viewed the concept of truth
so let's talk first about one of the most common theories of what constitutes truth from the history of philosophy one that richard <unk> thought has been dominant since the very beginning of the enlightenment
what he sometimes calls the <unk> paradigm sometimes called by others the correspondence theory of truth but let me take a second to tell you exactly what it is
the most basic idea is suppose somebody says a statement about the way things are in the world how do we tell if that statement is true
well that statement is true if it represents the way things really are in the world if there is a correspondence between the description and reality then we can say it's true
now there is of course mountains of detail that we could talk about here but richard <unk> disagrees with the entire premise of the correspondence theory even at this basic rudimentary level
whenever you try to create a bridge between a description you have in your head and the reality of the world that you're looking at the only way you can ever describe anything is through language
language <unk> our relationship with reality you can't access reality without language but to <unk> it even goes one step further than this
not only is language a medium between us and reality but language actually constitutes reality
meaning that the language we use and the way we use it changes the way we think about reality
this could be an entire series on its own but the point is that certain languages and the cultures that use them favor certain habits of interpreting events
these interpretations greatly determine the entire way we see reality and the way human beings perceive reality varies greatly from culture to culture language to language
so the idea that there're some sort of correspondence or representation going on that the world out there is somehow helping us verify whether statements are true or false
that's just wrong because <unk> thinks it would be impossible for us to ever step outside the parameters of language and access the world of things in themselves things independent of this language that we use to categorize them
he has a very famous quote that will be extremely useful for us for the remainder the episode he said quote the world does not speak only we do
the world can once we have programmed ourselves with a language cause us to hold beliefs but it cannot propose a language for us to speak only human beings can do that end quote
so it should be said <unk> not talking about ordinary language when he writes that he's talking about something else that we're going to get deep into here in a minute but i want to point out that this comparison he's making here
between accessing the world versus some sort of human created tool that's deeply affected by the bonds of history and culture
this is a classic move that <unk> makes that if you were new to <unk> might help you understand an outline of some of the topics he wants to cover for example language is extremely useful in human affairs
it's just not capable of describing the world of things in themselves outside of language
well consider how this compares to the beginning of the episode we have locke and kant trying to use reason to access some sort of ultimate truth about the universe but here's <unk> saying that <unk> is most useful in human affairs like the realm of the political
the world does not speak only we do here's another one from the enlightenment people like rousseau who believe in some sort of underlying human nature noble savages as he would say
really beyond that anyone that wants to take up the mantle of the common attitude that human beings at their very core dread seeing other human beings suffer
that's a common one for people to hold that naturally as human beings we don't want to see other people in pain so we can rely on the fact that if things ever got bad enough one culture would always come to the aid of another culture
<unk> actually responds to this position directly in an interaction with simon <unk> in the nineties so right here he is referencing the idea that there some sort of default altruism embedded into human nature
he says quote maybe there is such a sentient disposition but it is so malleable so capable of being combined with indifference to the suffering of people of the wrong sorts that it gives us precious little to rely on
we should just thank our lucky stars that there are quite a lot of people nowadays who are pretty consistently appalled by human beings suffering unnecessarily end quote
so he's saying maybe there is some aspect of human nature that makes people not want to see others suffer but if there is it's incredibly malleable
thank your lucky stars there happen to be a lot of people living today who don't want to see unnecessary suffering but the larger point there is that also if you're a fan of liberalism
there is nothing written into nature like a god or a <unk> facts that say liberalism is the way
but thank your lucky stars for the last couple hundred years there been a lot of people that believe in it as a strategy
so while we can understand the move that <unk> making here
placing a lot of authority in the hands of the people actually immersed in the culture this may start to bring up a whole new set of questions one of the most pressing might be this
if the authority of whether a social policy is good or not lies in the hands of the citizens and not even a philosopher can arrive at absolute foundations for even something as simple as human rights
don't those criticisms just instantly extend to my beliefs as an individual
like how am i supposed to ground my worldview in anything that's enduring enough that i can feel confident about it
the short answer to this question is that you can't and that shouldn't bother you
the longer answer can be found in <unk> lengthy exploration of the concept of irony
let's talk about it right now so a common email i get is from a person who says something to the effect of this
hi ah i've been listening to the show for a while i've heard about a bunch of different philosophers and i've gotten to a place where i feel the complexity of things makes me feel pretty uncertain about choosing a worldview
sometimes i feel agnostic about almost every issue of substance i can think of but this creates a problem for me because i still need to operate in day to day life
how is it possible to live a life where you're radically uncertain about things but still capable of functioning on an every day level
there are many answers to this question but richard <unk> offers one of them through discussion of living a life as an <unk>
now by <unk> he doesn't mean you're <unk> metal down at the home depot everyday the term <unk> is a reference to irony
to fully understand the life of an <unk> though we first need to understand the much more common almost ubiquitous way that people approach figuring things out about the world
a way of thinking deeply embedded in the history of philosophy
most people view their intellectual development as a person as a linear progression of moving past appearances and getting to the reality of the world
this goes all the way back to <unk> allegory of the cave shadows on a cave wall we do the work of a philosopher and eventually can ascend out of the cave and see the sun or true knowledge for what it actually is
well this way of viewing ourselves has been a fixture in our cultures for so long that it's the way many people see their process of growth when learning about the world
there's this intuitive sense that we're born we're young dumb naive we get information from our teachers parents basic news sources and there's a sense in which we're living in a world of appearances at this point
see it's not until we've done the work of reading five newspapers a day reading a thousand books traveled to a hundred different countries not until we've done that can we say that we've arrived at a worldview that sees reality on <unk> terms
but just as there's no single theory embedded into the universe about human rights or political strategy or anything for that matter
there's no single correct view of existence that you're somehow accessing through life experiences and reading a bunch of stuff
you may think that you have a rational justification for every view that you hold you may think it's the greatest worldview that it's ever been created
but it was created by you by a human being and <unk> would say that although we often deceive ourselves into thinking it's the truth
really what we've created here is what he calls a final vocabulary
more on final <unk> in one second but first i think it would be helpful to hear <unk> talk about a key distinction between someone saying the world is out there and saying the truth is out there
and how these statements ultimately relate to the language we use he says quote we need to make a distinction between the claim that the world is out there and the claim that the truth is out there
to say that the world is out there that it is not our creation is to say with common sense that most things in space and time are the effects of causes which do not include human mental states
to say that the truth is not out there is simply to say that where there are no sentences there is no truth that sentences are elements of human languages
and that human languages are human creations truth cannot be out there it cannot exist independently of the human mind
because sentences cannot so exist or be out there the world is out there but descriptions of the world are not
only descriptions of the world can be true or false the world on its own <unk> by the describing activities of human beings cannot end quote
this is one of <unk> most famous concepts what may refer to as the distinction between making and finding
locke and kant are not finding the truth about human rights they are using a very human process called reason to make a truth about human rights that we'd then use to structure our societies
liberalism was not found to be the best political strategy historical circumstances and common values among people made it the best political strategy for a time
when you read a thousand books you are not finding the truth about existence you are making a final vocabulary that allows you to interface with reality during the specific time that you happen to be living
by final vocabulary <unk> means a collection of stories metaphors narratives discourses tons of different tools of rhetoric that you use to make sense of the world and see your place in it
this is called a final vocabulary because the things that make it up are often very final the foundations are probably not gonna develop any further because when it comes down to it if you were pressed hard enough
to explain your worldview by somebody skilled enough at arguing with enough time on their hands <unk> says at eventually there would be no way for you to explain why your worldview is better than anyone else's in a <unk> way
it is a courageous thing to fight and die for your country because look fighting and dying for your country is like one of the most courageous things you can do the bible is true so you should trust the word of god
when pressed hard enough to justify your worldview in a conversation these are the sorts of stories and metaphors that ground the values of someone who thinks they got it all figured out
when the more accurate description is that they set up camp in an echo chamber of people that don't call them on their mistakes
either because they only talk to people who mostly agree with them already or because the people that disagree with them that they allow in to their circles lack the ability to press them further maybe people just want to be polite
maybe other people just don't care enough about changing someone into a little version of them to spend their time doing it
<unk> <unk> an antidote to this way of thinking about getting past appearances to the reality of the world here is a pretty famous passage from his work that describes his three criteria for living life as an <unk>
he says quote i shall define an <unk> as someone who <unk> three conditions
one she has radical and continuing doubts about the final vocabulary she currently uses because she has been impressed by other <unk> <unk> taken as final by people or books she has encountered
two she realizes that argument phrased in her present vocabulary can neither <unk> nor dissolve these doubts
three in so far as she <unk> about her situation she does not think that her vocabulary is closer to reality than others that it is in touch with a power not herself
<unk> who are inclined to <unk> see the choice between <unk> as made neither within a neutral or universal <unk> not by an attempt to fight one's way past appearances to the real but simply by playing the new off against the old
end quote so imagine living life as an <unk> as opposed to this other type of person we were just talking about
you'd live your day to day life not like <unk> from ancient athens you are not gonna walk in front of cars doubting whether or not they're actually there you'd have a sort of working theory a final vocabulary that you use to function
the difference would be that you would have seen other final <unk> seen their weaknesses
and you'd realize that yours is probably equally as flawed as there's in some way because it's not like you have special access to the truth
you don't have a deity backing your worldview you don't have some neutral point outside of culture and history that you're doing your thinking from you are just as <unk> as they are
and your conclusions rely on history and culture just as much as theirs do you would have continuing radical doubt about your relationship with reality
you'd also realize that any attempt by you to argue that your final vocabulary is somehow superior to others is a pointless exercise and it's actually you engaging in that circular reasoning we were talking about before
because think about it you're arguing for a set of stories and narratives as being superior but all the while you're using that set of stories and narratives as the premise that you're starting your arguments from
this is why <unk> thinks that when it comes to our final <unk> arguing in the traditional sense is not a very effective way of making any progress at all
<unk> says that an <unk> always realizes that anything can be made to look good or bad by being <unk>
because it's not like there some single <unk> standard out there
winning an argument in the times in <unk> is just far different than winning an argument today
because the values of the people judging have changed the historical circumstances have changed the story about how the world fits together has changed different arguments are more effective in different final <unk>
so if you are gonna argue with someone you are always relying on the fact that your points are gonna fit well into the final vocabulary the person that you're arguing with which is far from a guarantee
and the other side of that is that you may find yourself constantly arguing against a particular common final vocabulary that happens to dominate the culture you were born into
better to instead lead by example through irony when someone thinks they've <unk> the truth with their vocabulary they got it
the far more effective method will always be to do what <unk> calls ironic disruption which doesn't mean you pull out your richard <unk> handbook and argue them down point by point until they see the world the way that you do
the goal is through one method or another usually rhetorical devices
you try to allow this person to see on their own the perspective from outside their single worldview the hope being that once they're in this place will realize how limiting their basic way of viewing the world is
because it completely closes them off from new ways of connecting with people ideas and the world that is out there once again the world that is out there not the truth that is out there
to be in this place stepping outside of your worldview and seeing a completely different way the world can be rationally justified can be transformative
should be said this process also benefits the <unk> because they need as much experience with final <unk> as they can get they need to be able to spot these from a mile away
<unk> says an passage that an <unk> is never quite able to take themselves seriously
because they live their life acknowledging how much of their final vocabulary wasn't even a choice they consciously made
and that at any point some of the issues they believe in most strongly today might tomorrow change in a single conversation
this is a very different approach to your intellectual development and a very different way of approaching conversations with people that disagree with you politically
this person would seem like an alien in the current political landscape but this is ultimately the type of person that emerges in a pluralistic landscape of ideas rather than one that believes in a single correct answer to every political question
see you may wonder why bother why even spend a second of my life trying to talk to somebody showing them how they're limiting themselves to a single answer
let them do whatever it is they're gonna do but <unk> would say that these people that truly believe they are reading books and getting past the world of appearances to the true reality of things
this outdated <unk> attitude is responsible for so much of the cruelty that goes on in this world
liberal society in his eyes has a constant obligation to remind ourselves of the ways that the current order of things might be hurting people around us much more effective when you have a pluralistic outlook
you know there are <unk> out there that would make an argument that everybody should stop fighting over their petty disagreements because ultimately everything is arbitrary
there are capital r <unk> out there that'll say everyone should stop fighting because well i've come up with the right answer i found it no more work to be done
the way richard <unk> walks this line of nature and culture is partially through his beautiful use of pragmatism you know <unk> wouldn't say you should care less he wouldn't say you should care more
what he would say i think though is that the substance of what we care about lies in solidarity amongst fellow human beings
that solidarity is what keeps us in line not a cosmic law that solidarity is what determines our values not some philosopher up in a tower
to understand the historical and cultural environment that you live in is only the first step towards understanding the solidarity that holds society together
he said it well when describing one of his books here and one of the most famous passages from any of his work
he says quote the fundamental premise of this book is that a belief can still regulate action can still be worth dying for among people who are quite aware that this belief is caused by nothing more than contingent historical circumstances
end quote
thank you for listening i'll talk to you next time
i dreaded doing the show sometimes because whatever it was
feelings
yeah feelings feelings
i don't know if we had sort of an acknowledgement at that point that things were strained between us
but we were definitely not as close as we had once been by the time that that was happening
and part of this period of time is about the weird duality between becoming recognized as friends more publicly
even as we were spending less time in that kind of intimate communication that really makes a friendship feel safe and secure
i don't know does that feel right to you sorry
that feels so right please be my spokesperson for everything thank you
i'm ann friedman co-host of the podcast call your girlfriend and a journalist
and my name is <unk> sow
i am the other co-host of call your girlfriend and the co-author of big friendship with ann friedman
<unk> sow is a media strategist who was named to forbes thirty under thirty
ann friedman is a journalist whose writing has been in places like the new york times <unk> and the guardian
they have been best friends since two thousand and nine but for most of that time they lived on opposite coasts
in two thousand fourteen they started <unk> the podcast call your girlfriend whose tag line is a podcast for long-distance <unk> everywhere
it gets hundreds of thousands of listeners
they record it from their respective homes just like they did for the interview for this episode
but maintaining a friendship across the country and across a professional collaboration hasn't always been easy
the geographic distance between them turned into emotional distance and they had to figure out a way to <unk>
they've <unk> a book about it called big friendship which comes out in july
but that project is just the next chapter in their story which started over a decade ago
here's <unk>
ann and i met at a gossip girl viewing party in washington d c in two thousand nine
gossip core was important then it is still important today
that party was hosted by our mutual friend <unk>
she specifically invited both of us to that party having already identified that we would probably get along and be friends
in the same way that someone would like set you up on a blind date <unk>
this was like a friendship like set up
i do remember just feeling like every comment and every joke and every little like aside or contribution she made to the kind of meta conversation happening about the t v show was just spot on
and just being like i could be here forever and listen to every single word that comes out of this woman's mouth
i just really liked your outfit ann
wow
i was like yes finally a good outfit in this town
like i remember that being really important to me
but i just remember really appreciating that this person was both like hilarious and also smart
and then much later when i connected the dots to the fact that oh you were the ann friedman whose <unk> i had read before i was like great
everything makes sense now of course
this woman who wears this jeans and t-shirts situation so perfectly also have like ten out of ten tastes in teen television
and so you know it worked out really well for me
it just was easy right away
and so things escalated like very fast
we really went zero to a hundred in like the first couple of months
when i picture this time in our lives i just picture us spending dozens of hours on one of our couches
we just spent so many hours doing nothing
and in that way it felt very much like a college or a teen friendship to me
our twenties were very much marked by a lot of like big group hangs you know
but i think ah for me that when i knew that we were going to be friends for a long time is when it was okay to be like actually i don't wanna be doing that
i just want to be taking our bras off on the couch and just talking about mundane stuff or like reading side-by-side like not really saying anything to each other
i had been living with a boyfriend and we broke up when you and i had been friends for six months or something like that
and then when i went to revise my h r paperwork at work like who is your next of kin or whatever they make you put down for work emergencies
at that point it was very clear that it was you
yeah by that point you were someone in my life where i was like yes give her my <unk>
like please call her if i slip on a banana at work
this is the only capable person in my life thank you
your job at the banana factory
the people need to know
if i'm found in a ditch somewhere i hope that my phone literally says please call ann friedman
but we have now been friends who live apart for much longer than we were friends who lived in the same city
i knew that eventually you would move because we lived in a very transitional kind of city
and we had talked about it and it was like the great recession like people move to go to jobs like anywhere in the country
so it was not like it was a surprise that one of us would have to move
it just felt too soon
yeah and it's funny when i think about making that decision it was so wrapped up in work for me
like even though obviously i was physically leaving like our ability to spend all these hours on the couch together
i didn't feel like our friendship was going to end or even be <unk> threatened by the fact that i was moving away
and that's not to say that i wasn't sad about it or that it was easy
it's just at the time it really just felt like okay like we're going to be as close as we ever were
it's just gonna look a little different
i was devastated when you moved away ann and i remember very consciously having to make a choice of like i will never show this person that i am <unk> out by this
because i knew just how important it was for you and i was also really excited for you that you were actually on a path to do something that you wanted to do
i don't shine if you don't shine is something that <unk> first said to me and then we would say to each other
mostly i think as an assurance when one of us was worried she was taking up too much space in the other's brain or life or whatever
maybe asking for too much support or help a way of reassuring each other that we were invested in each other
and i don't shine if you don't shine was the assurance that <unk> a lot of those conversations
i have always felt that collaboration is better than competition
every success in my life is a testament to that
and somewhere along the line we started calling it shine theory privately
and then in twenty thirteen i was a columnist for the cut and wrote about it in a column
and lots of people read and shared the column and then it became a lot bigger than we had anticipated
but like all things that go viral there are also a lot of complications where you're like great is everyone really on the same page about what we're talking about
i remember much to my surprise and horror <unk> dot com had already been bought
a woman who ran a fitness studio was using it to push some sort of like miss fitness studio contest
my name was on the website
and so a lawyer was hired
and i think that having to go through this experience with you ann like i make decisions differently when i'm making decisions with someone than i do if i'm making them for myself
you really learn that like people have different appetites for negotiation
and like people have you know like a different style that they want to be <unk> or not <unk> in and whatever
i think that having to sort out a lot of those <unk> through this process illuminated a lot of things
and you know like one of them being like okay this really sucks but i really like the person i have to do this with
it was important to me that we were able to make a decision this big together
you know it was like that was not falling apart
the point at which we were trying to figure out what to do about the <unk> trademark was actually several months or maybe even dragged out for like more than a year
and that period of time i don't know if we had sort of an acknowledgement at that point that things were strained between us
but we were definitely not as close as we had once been by the time that that was happening
i think that we were entering into a period where a lot of things that we were <unk> were starting to become problems you know
like we were both changing and going through really hard things in our own lives very far apart physically and emotionally in most cases
and i think for me also like this has been the central the lesson that i am learning as as i grow up every day
people are changing constantly
and it is really hard to do a check in every day and realize that you are different than you were yesterday
and so i think that even if we were like living in the same city or we you know like bought a house together and we were roommates or whatever i still think that we would we would be two different people
clinging onto an idea of who i think someone is is very reassuring
but in that like you don't give people room to change their minds or to explore new things or to do new things and so
we were different and we didn't acknowledge it at the beginning and then we were changing and didn't realize that we were changing
and there was so much to account for in that gap
and so for each of us deciding to share less of ourselves was sometimes a conscious and sometimes a totally unconscious <unk> decision
yet we had all of this communication related to hosting a podcast together
for years and years and years the only podcast that i listened to was this american life
so it never even occurred to me that it was something we could do
but i had met gina <unk> our producer through ann and some of <unk> friends in l a and at some point somewhere in palm springs
like between probably drugs and wine for me it was suggested that we could do a podcast
i think she was just like you guys have good chemistry and you should think about doing this
and i'm also pretty sure we said that standard thing that i hear most people who are women say when you suggest they record themselves which is i hate my voice why would i do that or something like that
you know i'm pretty sure we were kind of dismissive but then also that we thought about it and talked about it and
several weeks later
do you remember when we were in the car and you bought the u r l on your phone
yes we came up with the name in the car
i confess that if i had really sat there and thought for longer than thirty seconds the show probably would not be called call your girlfriend
it would be called something else
indeed
but this is how we work
nothing is real unless there is a website
nothing is real unless you've had a meeting about it
and gina had done all of the work to say this is what we think it could be
and because she did that it made me feel like we could actually do it
we didn't think that tons of strangers would listen to it
i think some like a huge part of the show's success honestly is that we backed into all of these things
if they had come to me and said hey do you want to run a small media company where we have to get a government e i n and we have to do payroll
i would have said absolutely not please never speak to me again this is not what i want to do
and it sounds like a really dumb thing to say now but it never occurred to me that people who were not our friends would listen to it
hi welcome to call your girlfriend
a podcast for a long distance <unk> everywhere
um usually we are long distance <unk> but today we are in the same room
i know we are cheating and i love it
but i dreaded doing the show sometimes because whatever it was
feelings
yeah feelings
when we are not communicating well and you add distance to it like that was an issue
or always thinking like okay we'll deal with this later
there was always like a thing you know like a small thing that you would deal with later and then that jar got full and you're like oh this is a lot of stuff
and it happened in so many little ways that we didn't really even fully acknowledge it until things had gotten really bad
and then i think part of this period of time is about the weird duality between becoming recognized as friends more publicly
even as we were spending less time in that kind of intimate communication that really makes a friendship feel safe and secure
i don't know does that feel right to you sorry
that feels so right please be my spokesperson for everything thank you
there was sort of this illusion that we were still in touch in the same way we had always been
even though we weren't actually talking in like truly intimate ways about what was happening in each of our lives
we were kind of talking about logistical things for work or we were talking about the news or pop culture on the podcast
you know the kinds of conversations that really <unk> our relationship in the beginning just weren't happening anymore with the same frequency
i knew that we weren't doing well but i knew that you didn't hate me
the thing that was hard about our conflict is that we loved each other but we didn't know how to communicate with each other
i don't remember what the words were that you said in that conversation but i just remember the relief i felt when you told me that you didn't feel good
i feel awful i think is what i
thank you ann
should have been a scary moment
should've been like oh no and instead i was like thank god finally like it's all on the table
and i remember just feeling there is a huge sense of relief of great we are having a breakdown and we are talking about it i love it
and so that's how we ended up at couples therapy
doesn't it feel good to laugh about this now
oh like oh expensive every laugh is the sound of thousands of therapy dollars
we would like i don't know record the podcast and then you know like hang up that equipment well are you ready to go to doctor <unk> later
show up to therapy do that really hard work and also sometimes like agree or disagree with the therapist and be able to talk to each other about it
there is something about that that felt like such an out of body experience to me where it was like am i really this grown-up
who like i worked with this person we are now at our therapist and now we're gonna go home and lay on the floor because this was so hard
if you had not been at those therapy sessions with me i would not believe that it would've happened
but it did happen and somehow we did it
right we both still wanted to be there
and like i think about that saying about like how do you stay married you just don't get divorced or whatever i don't know
but i will say that like we were both continuing to show up
in our friendship i've learned a lot about being someone who who doesn't run away from their commitments
we felt like this experience we had had trying to repair an intimate friendship that had like hit the rocks is not something we saw reflected anywhere
and so there was a motivation i think to try to put some of this down in words
i think we started to talk about writing a book proposal in maybe <unk> does that sound right
yeah when it came to audio neither of us knew what we were doing and it was very much like okay great like we're starting from scratch
and with this you know ann is a writer
and i'm her friend but i'm also her fan
like i've read ann for years
and so i was really thinking about like how is this collaboration going to work
we sold this book as like we are two <unk> authors and i was like great
i'm like paired up with an olympian and now we have to do hurdles
you know a lot of books that are <unk>
you know in this <unk> way have you know chapter one is by one person and then chapter two is by the other person and they kind of volley back and forth
and we made a choice pretty early on that we wanted to have one narrative
and so as a project it is really impossible to <unk> our various inputs
and i don't know i feel like that feels truer to me in the sense of like that's really what a friendship feels like
and the way we did that is we outline together quite meticulously and then we would take a section of the outline split up
we'd each write <unk> that section of the outline on our separate computers and then we would each read aloud what we had written to the other
and then we would knit them together and keep the best parts of both and then move on to the next section of the outline for seventy thousand words
wow
can you believe we did that
i'm just like saying that out loud it's wild
my truly like favorite moments of our writing process is when i would be frustrated or ready to give up and i would look around
and you were typing away furiously with your signature ann friedman typing noises and exclaim out loud i love words those were the moments
i can't believe you're <unk> me like this
i am <unk> you you are a <unk> writer and it is disgusting to be a part of but also it's you know i'm like we got we did it
my favorite moments are hearing you from like the other end of the house be like okay okay
like i can tell you we're really working through something
like you had really had a breakthrough
one thing that is truly consistent across every year of our friendship is that like i always do want to know what you think
i always do think you have the best jokes
like that is like never ever changed

from p r x
i was like mike i really want to work together
and i just remember his response he was like count me interested
and i don't know how you proposed to your wife but when you asked her to marry you if she had come back said and said count me interested
would you have been like that was a yes
i mean come on
i would have asked for clarification
i'm mike <unk> i was co-founder and former c t o of instagram
i'm kevin <unk> former c e o and co-founder of instagram
kevin <unk> and mike <unk> co-founded instagram in two thousand ten
a year half later they sold it to facebook for a billion dollars
they stayed on to run the company for another six years
and then in two thousand eighteen they left together
and even now they still work together
the first time they met though they had no idea that it would lead to something so meaningful
in fact kevin doesn't even remember that first time they met
i'd like to say i do i really don't um
the first time i remember meeting mike was in coffee bar the small cafe in san francisco
it became my go to office because i had left my job and i was working on this app called <unk>
and it was just me
i knew of mike i had seen him like we were in the same circles
and i recognized mike and i walked over to say hello
but the first thing i noticed was the thing he was working on
it was like this beautiful website
and i didn't realize he was working with a designer
so anyway in my mind mike was like this amazing designer
little did i know that actually he was an amazing engineer
i don't know that you've ever touched photoshop actually
actually that's not true
i built the shutter on the very first version of instagram and it was very basic
wasn't the shutter literally just two gray <unk> that just closed and opened
that's what i said very basic
that was not that was not that good honestly
but that was the first time i remember hanging out with you cause i remember being so impressed
and i asked you what tool you were using
and i don't remember the tool but i remember using it and just being like oh man like
so good to have like a mike in your life where you can ask him a question they just always have the best answer
and it turns out years later i still feel like that's true
i remember thinking oh here's somebody who's actually like pursuing something that he's excited about
actually building it and like oh a kindred spirit that's here on the weekends not just to check facebook or do something but is it building
so having another builder was exciting i'm like oh somebody else cares about the stuff
i think maybe where mike and i overlap most is the fact that we both love to make things
my dream was always to build something that a lot of people used
so our friendship revolves around that
and it just so happens that that also happens to be a profession
i did know that he was working on <unk>
i think i already had maybe installed it and just playing around with it
was a check in app it let you check in at different places
it was a way of sharing what you were up to and where you were
with the twist that you can add photos and videos to it which in two thousand and nine was actually the only one i could find that could do that
and even though you had to jump through all these hoops to upload a photo on <unk>
people were doing it and all of a sudden it wasn't just this person is here but oh that's what it looks like there
so that was to me the inkling of something interesting in <unk>
but you know i was pitching it to investors and one of the investors was like yeah here's fifty grand
you can go work on this and like take a small small <unk>
but you have to get a co-founder these things work best when you have a co-founder
he was saying hey look at all the best companies in the world
they were like ones that really work are the ones were generally there's more than one solo person running the ship
google was a co-founder pair
youtube was a co-founder pair
the point is when you have a team you're more likely to succeed
and i agreed with that i mean the pattern was clearly there the evidence was there
so kind of went through the <unk> in my mind of like who do i know that could be a co-founder
and i remember running into mike and i think the next time i ran to him i floated the idea hey like maybe we should work together on this
we basically decided we were going to prototype working together
so we would get together at a cafe near mike's house and we created a fake project
why we didn't just work on <unk> i don't know but we created a fake project with a fake outcome we wanted to accomplish that night
mike would do one half of it i'd do a different half of it and we'd come together and we'd ask questions figure out how each other worked
and we really enjoyed that experience
so you know i remember this fateful day standing at the <unk> station before mike had to go to work and
i was like mike i really want to work together
in my head i was probably like i really want to work together and i really need this fifty thousand dollars that's right so i need a co-founder too
and i asked him this question and i just remember his response he was like count me interested
count me interested like you know are you in or are you out
i vividly remember the moment he asked because i had one of those life flashing before your eyes but not the past the future
i was like okay i can be working with somebody who i have come to really start respecting and i wanna work with
and that's where count me interested came from which to me sounded like a yes but maybe i was a little <unk>
but to me it was just like oh yeah of course
i i'm gonna ask you a question okay
i want a little bit of
understanding here
you're now married
i don't know how you proposed your wife but when you asked her to marry you if she had come back said and said count me interested
would you have been like that was a yes
asked for clarification
i look back and a lot of the major decisions in my life that i've made
this one was an easier one where i knew that it was what i wanted to do and then the next week was <unk> can i do it
you know i've come from brazil i was on a work visa
you were taking on so much risk because you had everything set
they gave you a job you had this work visa everything
and you were jumping in like i think back how crazy we were to do that
we had to like form a company so that the government would be like okay you can have this visa
i think this was the first moment where i really started feeling this sort of mutual trust with kevin
cause the count me interested moment was january and we applied you know soon afterwards
and eighty days goes by ninety days goes by
and i was like <unk> look i know you want to get this off the ground
and it's like march it's april now like
three months is forever and startup land like if you want to cut this and be like i'm just gonna find a u s co-founder that can make this work i'll get it
and i remember kevin was like no man like we're gonna make this work
let's email the lawyer let's like keep pushing forward like no we'll wait we'll figure this out and
that meant so much to me
i mean it still does like cause he could have easily been like yeah man this is too hard i need to get this going
and that would have been a rational decision to have made
but instead he was like no let's like figure this out and
it finally came and that point it was like all right i can actually join and actually do this stuff together
we had been working on <unk> for a while eight nine months or something by that time
and we were meeting one of our early investors
and he was like so what are you building what's up like what's new
and we're like well you know we have these features and we it does this thing and it does this thing
and he his face was just blank
like he's just looking at us like what are you talking i don't understand what you're trying to build
and we were so sad after that meeting because it was so clear to us that we couldn't explain what we were working on
so we went back to the office we sat in front of a whiteboard and we said okay we have to focus this thing
it's trying to do too much all at once
so we stripped everything away that day
and we focused just on the components that would effectively become instagram
and maybe in the course of a week or two made the first version of instagram
i spent far more time with kevin than any other human being for that first year of instagram easily right we were in there every single day
for thirteen fourteen hours sometimes over night
you know mike would be brushing his teeth in the employee bathroom you know at four a m just because like we had been there all night
we got to launch day we launch it to the world
october sixth two thousand ten i know that date and the date of my daughter's birth those are the two dates i will never forget right
people liked it people started using it
and i was taken aback because i mean i had worked at a company before that struggled to get ten thousand people to use it over a year
and we got to twenty-five thousand that first day
and i remember turning to mike and i said i think we've created something
i'm usually the pessimist and mike is usually i i'm not sure optimist but you're <unk> right
but like i had this moment of clarity that there was something special cause i'd never seen people react this way
and mike just looked at me like i don't know maybe not maybe this is all going to come crashing down
the one little <unk> server that we had was just like metaphorically and perhaps physically melting by the all the traffic that was coming at it
i really felt like we had <unk> this opportunity
and i was like should probably add another server
and kevin was like no we don't need another server
and you know in in retrospect i think it was like you know we didn't know if this thing was going to take off and it was expensive to add another server like did we really need it
and i was no i think we do
and then mike later he oh man sorry like i was a little heated
you know we had been up for thirty-six hours at that point you know kind of fighting off sleep and also excited
both the best and worst days of our lives
it was like you know the thing was working but also was crashing
i think that was the only time we've ever raised our voices with each other
it was brief it was like a probably thirty second interaction
i approve this message
which is true like that was the one time that ah it was heated and it was just the heat of the moment
actually i'm gonna take it way back at our first disagreement which actually i haven't thought about in many years
two or three weeks into working together i remember coming in and saying
what do you think of us like one or two days a week just working from home cause i can just jam on stuff and just stay up all night and code and i'll be up until noon
you know like i think i'll work better that way and you're like
no i'd really like for us to be in the same office together i think that matters a lot
and i remember being annoyed for like ten seconds
i was like yeah okay like sure like we'd give that a try
you know and like in the end it was great like we were able to jam on ideas and move really quickly and
if i had to like abstract it and what i learned about working with kevin over the years it was i don't think you're ever a person that will just agree to something because it will make somebody else happy
but you also make sure that in <unk> you're also not being a jerk and making them feel bad about feeling differently you're like
no i've thought about this and here's you know what i wanna do before
is there like a reason why you know you really feel differently and then we can have the conversation
that sort of like <unk> ability to disagree is really important
i get annoyed really easily
but interesting thing is mike doesn't annoy me like he really doesn't
like i really don't get annoyed with mike cause he has character and integrity
those are the two things i care about
like you're just a generally good person and when you say you're going to do something you do it
who cares if like you know mike chose the wrong x y or z to solve a problem or maybe introduced a bug or what like i don't care
mike has never made except for that one time on the server issue mike has never made me angry
i don't think we ever actually had titles for the longest time
i guess once we started doing public you know events we had to talk about what our titles were
there was a time where we were like okay you're c t o i'm c e o we kind of like divided it that way
but you always say co-founder first that's the title
when i thought about my identity and like what we were doing in the company it was like co-founder maybe technical co-founder if you wanted to put an adjective in front of it
required technical co-founder
but i do also think and this speaks to our personality and our relationship it is really important for any company to ultimately have one final decision maker
and i've seen so many companies not have one and it become a mess sometimes there's a tie break needed or sometimes like a call needs to get made
you really need to find somebody who's willing to like make that call and you all have to be ready to like make that person successful in that role or else it's just not gonna work
we had a bunch of people that really wanted instagram inside their company
but we were having so much fun doing our own thing that like we just didn't wanna like be part of any other company
we didn't want to be a wing of a building we wanted to be the building
and i remember you turned to me at one point you're like i really don't think we should like pursue any of these
like i think we're better off independent but if you feel differently like let me know like let's have that conversation
which was helpful is that made me reflect and be like no no this is really fun
like i'm working with somebody i deeply respect we're starting to build a team that's working
yeah let's like let's keep doing this thing we've still got money in the bank
so you know for the longest time we were just like we're gonna do this thing ourselves
and the only time we literally had like a number to face was the facebook offer
when we were like oh a billion dollars just sounds funny to say right like
it's a billion ah ah you think of like dr evil or one of these movies right
but someone comes along and offers you a billion dollars for something you've been working on for i don't know all of a year publicly and then you've got eleven employees and you're just like man i'm like how do you even do that calculus like
what do you say to that
i really remember being in sort of like a a <unk> it's like everything was just very strange
we had long conversation about what we want to do
at the end of the day the thing that mattered the most to us was that they wanted us to keep running it independently like we had been doing they
they were like no <unk> a thing
you're a community you guys have effectively a team and a company and a culture
keep doing that
and we stayed six years
there was a lot of like hey checking in how are you feeling what do you want to do like
we only wanted to be at instagram if the other person was at instagram
every january i would decide i wanted to consciously <unk> to still being there
make it an intentional choice
like i come around in january and i say is this still what i want to be learning
i vow to myself it's funny the vows you make to yourself when you're eighteen years old
i vowed to myself when i was eighteen i wanted to have a life full of unique years not the same year over and over again
like that was my biggest fear
and i looked and i was like i feel like you know we've done incredibly hard things
i've learned a ton but it feels like we're on some like diminishing returns curve of learning
and i remember i had dinner with kevin i was like hey man like i feel like it might be time for me to try something different which is like a hard conversation like it's a scary conversation to have
i remember kevin turned to me and said like i get where you're coming from
is there anything that you think would still feel like a new interesting thing
i like listed a couple of things
and then will i had the interesting experience of kind of doing part of <unk> job for a few months cause he went out on <unk> leave
and he was out he was like mike i'm on <unk> leave i really want to be present with my kid mike
can you make sure things go well while i'm away
and it was interesting because in my head i always had this question like is the one thing that i would make me stay like to have this very different experience of being c e o rather than c t o
and i got to have that experience for like two months
i remember kevin getting back i was like kevin i do not want your job at all
and like we'd always joke that one of the reasons we work together is that we didn't want each other's jobs
and at some point it felt like a thing i had always said and i wanted to make sure it was actually really true
but i remember at the end of that experience being like no i'm really glad i got to try cause it made me realize where my happy spot is is not in that role
it's in the role i was in it and that role i feel like i've accomplished what i wanted to accomplish
and i wanted something hard
and i wanted to be bad at something again
maybe it won't be as big as instagram maybe it won't
probably won't be as big as instagram let's be honest
but maybe it'll be just as fun to learn along the way
that's ultimately what made me want to jump
but we had no idea what we were gonna do
the first thing was rest and recovery
we were kind of off doing our own thing we wanted to just chill out and disconnect a little bit but we <unk> and it was like yeah what do you miss the most
it's like well i miss hanging out of course and you say those nice things to each other but i miss building stuff
i learned a big lesson i think in the middle months before we really <unk> which was i think i'm holding this idea of kevin in my head of like
i bet he's like already thought of like what's next and like he hasn't told me about it
and i realized like
oh no really
no i created this like thing of like oh like we haven't talked in a few months
and if you think about it i've never you know actually thought about this but like that was the longest we went without really talking in nine years
so like
it was like man like we haven't talked which must mean that like he doesn't want to talk to me
and i remember having this phone call that was so like what a relief like we talked on the phone and you're like yeah like i'm where you are
like i haven't thought about what's next and i'd love to work with you and i love like to love to keep working with you too
to me the lesson learned was like if you have like a very close relationship with somebody and then you just don't talk to them for a few months like
your brain is gonna start assuming that that silence means something that absolutely doesn't
it just meant that we just needed some time to clear our heads and have our own thing
and once he talked i was like oh okay great he feels the same way i do which is like we don't know exactly what it is yet but we want to do it with each other
and that was a real like relief for me i was like great we're on the same page and now we can just spend the time to explore and figure out what we're excited to build next
both of us wanted to do something together again
like that was rare like most co-founder pairs find themselves in some sort of fight along the way and break up and
the idea that we could have a new challenge together potentially i think was what made it way more exciting
i'm not sure we were like looking for personal relationship when we started like a friendship
but the bond we have now is
i think i'd <unk> to people who like were in the military together
and i'm not like saying were we did anything even close to as important as that but when you go through things with someone when people try to kill your company when people try to throw you under the bus
all this stuff has happened to us and then some
and i remember very specifically this moment we ah we're having a disagreement with an investor
and we were so stressed out and we went to this really terrible <unk> on market street
but we sat down and we both ordered like the <unk> thing we could possibly imagine
and honestly that might have been a low in the company but it was a high for me
like i look back on that moment really fondly because it was us against the world
it was like we're gonna win this thing even if people don't believe in us even if we're having this thing go on like we're gonna make this work
call it friendship but that is like a bond that you don't form hanging out
the fact that we still like each other this long i think speaks to like a deeper trust and like real bond
but i think the fact that we liked each other after that first year which was like pure exposure spoke to trust but i think also just the
we have a way about each other that is not one that we find annoying
which sounds trivial but actually when if you're that around somebody for that long for that many days
you haven't showered in three days sometimes and you're eating the same lunch you've eaten every single day like
it's actually really important and hard to screen for in a like you know couple of nights in a coffee shop <unk>
i think that was a regard where we probably got lucky
couldn't have said it better that's exactly it

a word of warning this series contains mature language depicting instances of sexual physical and or emotional abuse of children
are you the toughest coach in the u s will you put the kids through here is it more demanding than most places
i really can't answer on that one because i don't know you know what's going on in other places
did the <unk> have great success as coaches absolutely
oh my god i can't express the feeling
did they create a system that established the u s women as an overwhelming powerhouse most definitely
gold and silver <unk> for team u s a
for more than four decades no name has meant more to women's gymnastics than <unk> <unk> and martha <unk> two of the most successful coaches in gymnastics history
right now we turn to women's gymnastics and the united states which has become a power in recent years now looking to become the power
<unk> and martha <unk> gave the u s its first superstar mary lou <unk> its first gold medal and eventually put american <unk> on top of the medal stand year after year after year
<unk> became <unk> as a big bear of a man <unk> and loud
<unk> was the guy with the thick accent that was giving these big bear hugs
martha came across as the opposite of her husband <unk> and reserved what is she like
she is actually very sweet but very tough
if we gave a hundred percent she wanted one hundred ten nothing was ever good enough for martha and i think that s what made us so good
the <unk> embody remarkable achievement
did it come at a price hell yeah
this is heavy medals from thirty for thirty podcasts i'm alyssa <unk> gymnastics has been part of my life in some form for as long as i can remember from watching mary lou on t v at the nineteen <unk> olympics when i was seven too later being a teenage <unk> obsessing over kim <unk> tumbling passes
and for the past fifteen years at e s p n where my reporting partner bonnie ford and i both cover international sports
when i covered my first summer olympic games in beijing in two thousand and eight china was accused of having an <unk> <unk> on the team and i was writing about it i'll never forget <unk> <unk> shouting into my digital recorder about how the chinese coaches had just stolen his playbook
i wish i still had that tape here was <unk> <unk> not just upset that china had possibly broken the rules but wanting to make sure i knew he deserved credit for recognizing that younger and smaller <unk> had better chances for gold it was a point he'd been making to reporters for years
as the truth has come to light about the consequences of pinning a nation's hopes on the shoulders of children <unk> and martha <unk> have come under scrutiny
today breaking news allegations that strike at the heart of a very successful u s olympic sport
one of the worst things we have seen in u s olympic history
their legacy is littered with questions about what they accomplished and how much responsibility they bear for the incredible amount of damage that has been done
claims tonight from a former <unk> who has filed suit against a doctor and legendary coaches <unk> and martha <unk>
yes this unnamed <unk> <unk> the <unk> of turning a blind eye to abuse
but as complicated as their story would become it all started with something simple
it started with perfection
at the nineteen seventy six olympic games in montreal <unk> nadia <unk> earned the first perfect ten in olympic gymnastics history
and when the judges announced her score the crowd <unk> but no one more so than <unk> coach <unk> <unk>
at thirty three years old <unk> and martha <unk> were just beginning their career as coaches outside of romania they were unknowns but <unk> was impossible to miss
especially as the six foot plus coach towered over his four foot eleven <unk> pound <unk>
over the course of a single thrilling week nadia became the crowd favorite and an international star as she scored perfect ten after perfect ten
an unbelievable seven perfect tens all together and in the individual all around nadia won the gold medal a first for romania
finally nadia comes up and does her incredible routine that's where the crowd exploded i mean there was explosion explosion of support explosion of love and excitement and i'm looking through the corner of my eyes
and i see the soviet team getting they stuff and they walking out of the arena i said yes yes we got it
finally after decades of dominance a romanian had beaten the soviets
in a way for some people this is the end of a love affair the <unk> of the u s s r <unk> competition nadia <unk> now takes over the <unk> sprite of a girl
but for <unk> <unk> and his wife and coaching partner martha there was something even greater at stake the favor of the romanian government
it was late night on the romanian time so i was watching it with our team doctor and his wife <unk> friend and my wife we watched on a black and white t v
my name is <unk> <unk> that's the hungarian pronunciation in english is like gee <unk> po <unk> so <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> was the <unk> for the romanian national team
he'd been working with <unk> and martha for years he'd designed <unk> floor routine and helped her train for this moment but instead of watching from the sidelines with <unk> and martha he was watching from home because the romanian government wouldn't let him travel to montreal
because i didn't get the visa to go
<unk> had recently married a french woman and so the government didn't trust him to go to canada and actually return to romania
from his living room in the small town of <unk> <unk> like the rest of romania watched nadia make history
the whole town came out to the street it was like midnight all of them they come out and this was like a carnival in rio you know it was unbelievable first off they get drunk you know that was the first thing but everyone was so happy
and and there was a huge celebration huge
but this moment was bigger than just the party in those small town streets
the whole world was in ecstasy you know
the whole world was in ecstasy that's why <unk> perfect tens and her gold medal were so important they made romania visible a country that suddenly stood out from the rest of the communist bloc
nadia was a lovable figure from a place the western world saw as very grim
nadia was the diamond she was the treasure of romania she was the best product romania ever had nadia put romania on the map after nadia everybody knows that there is the romania
during the cold war sports were a way for nations to assert their power without going to war olympic success equaled national pride for athletes and coaches in romania it meant security and stature it meant not waiting in line for a loaf of bread
people suffer from shortages
brought about by despotism and corruption of the imperial government
and romania at that time was under a very very strict ugly dictatorship and it was a cult of personality
public display of giant portraits of communist leaders
we had to <unk> the leader of the country
<unk> win was the ultimate political validation for the country's leader nicolae <unk>
the <unk> was <unk> the crowning of a princess
there was a national celebration the president got very excited
the presentation was made personally by the president of romania nicolae <unk>
nadia and the <unk> were welcomed home to romania as heroes
they gave us awards you know we got um some bonuses we paid only half of the tax like everybody paid we got fifty percent deduction on our taxes
propaganda is power in a regime like <unk> and there was no better propaganda than celebrating and rewarding the success of its olympic champion and the coaches who had brought romania such high honor
nadia was made a hero of the socialist country and she was a hero all decorated
her country honored nadia with its highest award the hero of the socialist labor
she got the car <unk> got two cars
nadia and the <unk> were gifted cars their taxes were cut in half as the rest of the country dealt with crushing rations the romanian coaches and their <unk> had meals delivered to them for free
the days of waiting in food lines were over for them
the only thing that they all expected us to do is to win medals
as long as they could keep making romania proud
<unk> <unk> had always been an athlete but never a <unk>
he was a boxer in the beginning then he became a hammer <unk> then he became a <unk> coach so everything but gymnastics
<unk> first experience with gymnastics didn't come until college
i had to pass some <unk> test which was all difficult to me i was a tall and pretty heavy guy
so it was it was something something to to see me ah swinging on the bars and doing a tumbling which was an unknown sport for me totally unknown before
he was introduced to gymnastics and to one of his classmates martha <unk> the woman he would marry
i got married and my wife a former <unk> she was a good <unk> though we got married and we went out to teach the gymnastics
martha and <unk> both <unk> in physical education with the goal of coaching young kids they wanted to work together and decided to focus on her specialty gymnastics
it was a new experience totally new experience for me i never had the experience to teach young children i didn't know how to to start with them
<unk> came to the sport not knowing much about gymnastics but that didn't really matter because he was essentially teaching himself the basics of the sport by teaching little kids who didn't know much about gymnastics themselves
that's something <unk> noticed the first time he saw <unk> in action
i saw this big guy big guy ah dressed in a blue <unk> and some very small little kids who were up almost just up to his hips you know
flipping like they're little fishes in the water you know like little silver fishes tumbling on the floor it was very impressive and i saw this guy with huge hands you know sometimes spotting them and throwing them up in the air and catching them and
oh my god this guy there was something different
it was kind of an ideal match giant <unk> could easily spot these small kids and help them safely learn new skills his wife martha had the gymnastics know how and credibility
they started to teach very young kids very hard tricks easy to spot them you know
the <unk> refined their system in local <unk> for ten years before breaking onto the national stage
after that he ah got in connection with the ah <unk> federation ah they get lots of help from ah them
<unk> and <unk> approach got results nearly all of the athletes on the romanian olympic team that won the silver medal in nineteen <unk> had trained with the <unk>
as a group they were noticeably younger and <unk> than the <unk> who had come before them
<unk> nadia <unk> of romania four feet eleven <unk> pounds
by comparison the nineteen <unk> olympic gold medalist was a <unk> the nineteen <unk> gold medalist was <unk> they'd been through puberty they were taller they had women's bodies
when nadia won gold at fourteen years old it sealed the trend toward child athletes
the youngest ever to win a gold medal in the all around competition
nadia congratulations again and i one thing i wanted to ask she's the youngest girl to win a gold medal at the olympic games where does she go from here what what about nineteen eighty
i'm going to participate at the olympics in moscow and i'm going to try to do better than i did here and learn a lot new things
how many more tens does she expect
as many as possible
congratulations and to your coach <unk> <unk>
before the nineteen <unk> games were even over the <unk> were focused on repeating and adding to that success and because <unk> was seen as responsible for nadia
the romanian government put the <unk> in charge of a new national training center in the small industrial town of <unk>
<unk> always like to ah work in this type of a small places when he had lots of control
it was isolated that was the point <unk> liked to keep tabs on the girls
so he knew when the girls went to buy some ice cream or ah he knew because he knew everybody so the girls were under control they could not go and buy food or something without him knowing it
<unk> had moved to <unk> with <unk> and martha to continue as the team's <unk> and dance coach they were working at the pinnacle of <unk> centralized system
and there was tremendous pressure to find more <unk>
my real full name is ah <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> was a <unk> for <unk> national team from nineteen <unk> to nineteen <unk> she competed under her middle and maiden names <unk> <unk>
because it sounded more like romanian
by age twelve <unk> was the reigning junior national champion
i just got a call at home
it was <unk> <unk>
i saw nadia on t v and i loved gymnastics and i said i always told my mom my gosh i wish i could train with her but that's never gonna happen and then we get a phone call and i was like i said okay mom let's go
<unk> traveled with her mother by train to <unk>
i was so happy when we got there and i saw <unk> he was he looked to me like a mountain i was a little tiny girl and he was like big and all smiling and everything
her mother kissed her and placed a half a loaf of bread in a dresser drawer before leaving she told her daughter to please remember to eat
she said okay honey i need to leave now i need to catch a train i said bye mom i gave her a kiss and then <unk> showed her to the through the hallway to the door
and i was just like oh okay by myself in a room i said okay so where should i put my stuff and the door just suddenly opens ah ah in a scary way and you know just really fast
and <unk> comes in and he smacked me over the face so hard that i flew on my bed and he opened the drawer where my bread was in and he said if i ever see you again eating anything like this i will kill you
that was my welcome
don't misunderstand the national training center at a drab town called <unk> is not a concentration camp there are pillow fights and fun and going to school but there's mostly training
and tough training it is this was nadia in her training days with coach <unk> standing by but not catching her is this training or torture and what did the youngsters think about
we've felt watched all the time
<unk> <unk> was thirteen years old when she was recruited to train with <unk> and the other <unk> in the making
life in <unk> was one of deprivation <unk> and living in constant fear
i tell you what i what i saw when i got there you know two little crackers in the morning it was a little food but it was not enough
i mean i ate toothpaste because i was not able to sleep i was so hungry and i just tell them i need something in my stomach
we were eating <unk> on the street if you find a little apple that it was like <unk> then you would pick it up
you you fall asleep dreaming about <unk> floating in front of your eyes you fall asleep seeing like fried chicken
especially when you go on the coaches eat to a table next to you and they get like fried chicken and french fries and they eat right next to us and we sit there what we have
a yogurt a plain yogurt and a boiled egg or you have a dry piece of meat that gets stuck in your throat it's so dry
i mean you you go to sleep hungry and with all that training you know training training training and we were given a fist of vitamins or who knows what was that
and we never knew what's gonna happen next and there were times where eleven o'clock at night came and <unk> came to the dorm and said put your shoes on and let's go start running outside you're fat as pigs
go run rain shine snowing
there was no patience or compassion for injuries at <unk> training center
he wanted everything fast quick you know put them back together fast you know if the doctor doesn't didn't follow <unk> orders you know they are out
<unk> fired doctors who didn't follow his orders and the <unk> knew that complaining about injuries could lead to a beating
one day doing a vault at practice <unk> landed awkwardly and broke two fingers she walked back to her teammates and showed them her throbbing right hand
and they told me shut up don't say anything because he's gonna get so mad and i had to finish that practice with two broken fingers
i remember trying to grab the bar with the one one of the hands i couldn't put two fingers down and somehow he just got kind of sick of looking at me not doing a good job
he said few words you know and and just just dismissed me nobody's gonna take me to take an x-ray not have a doctor to look at this
and all what i hear from colleagues is just keep going
everything about the <unk> lives in <unk> was monitored the national team coaches listened to their phone calls and intercepted their mail
when homesick girls ran away from the training center police took them back to <unk>
i was so scared i swear i thought he has eyes on trees and the bushes on the walls
we couldn't quit it was not a choice and you had to keep going against your will against everything
<unk> maintained complete control while martha came into the gym mostly to coach balance beam
to me it always seemed like he was always on top of everything and she was doing whatever he wanted her to do and obeying everything
when martha was in the gym she could also be physically abusive
and we could actually defend ourselves from her because she was not strong enough to catch us and hit us
so you know something like she was scratch us or and she would grab us from the neck like this and then she would pull her <unk> into your meat and it kinda hurt but she was she was not good at beating
<unk> was the bad one oh gosh that was bad
and when they faltered at meets they faced his wrath
let's say on beam you fell on beam that was a disaster you got off the beam saluted the judges and we went straight to the bathroom and he came after us and we got beaten up
and then he said well you better pull yourself together because you have two more events
the girls only respite from <unk> and martha was their dance classes with <unk>
you know it was relaxing for us it was fun he could ah make us you know smile and have a good time
they also knew he would look out for them
<unk> was always the one that was always behind <unk> back he was protecting us
when he was together with <unk> and martha he was a tough guy because he had to look like a tough guy because he would have probably lost his job if he didn't
so every time we went to practice at the gym in the afternoon and <unk> was there before and he was always at the door looking through the keyhole and when <unk> and martha coming he said six six six and five five was martha and six was <unk>
<unk> used dance counts as code names for martha and <unk>
that's how we knew when he said six we already were like oh my gosh <unk> coming
some days <unk> disappeared from the gym to go hunting
those are the best days of our lives in the gym so basically <unk> wasn't there
who was <unk>
oh <unk>
<unk> and martha faced enormous pressure going into the nineteen eighty olympics their standing with the government was only as good as their next result
they'd have to match or beat the success of the <unk> games to keep their country's favor
the entire romanian team felt the weight of their country's oppressive regime when they met with officials before they left for moscow
some kind of lieutenant i don't know he was all dressed in green and stuff big and big guy and really serious and he said you better think what you're doing twice don't you ever bring shame on your country you're wearing our country on your shoulders
trying to defend her gold medal in the <unk> nadia became the center of a judging dispute
nadia went on a beam and her beam score didn't come up
<unk> protested <unk> low beam score in full view of the television cameras
nadia had to settle for the silver in the <unk> but went on to win gold on floor and beam <unk> won a silver medal on the uneven bars
the <unk> repeated with a silver in the team competition but this time finishing second to the russians was a disappointment <unk> and martha weren't returning to romania as heroes again
so when we made a big <unk> about <unk> scoring on beam the government didn't like it
in a society <unk> about how it was perceived on the world stage and particularly by its communist allies <unk> protest in response to the russian judge embarrassed the romanian officials
plus his most important ally in the <unk> regime
had just been <unk>
so ah <unk> knew that the end is close and then he told me at that moment we are now in big trouble and from there everything started to go sour for us
the first time i ever saw <unk> <unk> in action with his <unk> was pretty memorable
it was the nadia <unk> tour when <unk> and the romanian women's national team toured with the american team in march nineteen <unk>
my reporting partner bonnie ford covered the detroit stop of the nadia <unk> tour a <unk> promotional tour of the u s featuring the romanian national team and its superstar
so i personally as both an olympic fan and a reporter at that time i didn't think of it as a political event where the <unk> were showing off their system so to speak
certainly they did they saw it as a propaganda tool and a chance to highlight their excellence
but to me it was just a chance to see the best athlete in her sport
i was focused on nadia the audience was focused on nadia a lot of you know very excited young girls this was like <unk> nadia mania was definitely a real thing
<unk> <unk> was very visible and he was unmistakable on the floor huge guy he was in our eyes the guru the genius behind <unk> precision and and perfection
being on tour with <unk> as the <unk> coach it was interesting to watch him and the <unk> really just how they interacted with each other
the u s national team had been invited to perform with the <unk> on their tour <unk> <unk> was a member of that team
the <unk> were always very stern very robotic they worked extremely hard they did numbers of routines and skills way beyond what we had ever seen
mike jacki the man who would become the president of the u s gymnastics federation was on the tour working for one of the equipment sponsors he had a front row seat to the <unk>
martha was in the background she didn't say anything <unk> instructed her like he instructed everybody else she was very subservient i mean it it was not a coaching duo
you know he was definitely the coach and she was definitely the third assistant even though there wasn't a first or second assistant
but despite how well the tour was going things behind the scenes were deteriorating for the romanian coaches
they could tell from the way officials were treating them that they were in danger of losing their jobs and their prestige
we were done then we were treated very poorly from the very beginning of the tour i mean the president of the gymnastics federation was very gave us a cold shoulder
on the washington d c stop they were invited to a dinner party hosted by the romanian ambassador
and at the dinner party nobody would talk to us they look at us like strangers like not even part of the team i think we had a feeling that there's something was going on
<unk> said that i don't know if we have any future back in romania
the tour was almost over in two days they'd be headed home the <unk> and <unk> knew things could only get worse for them that their favor with a fickle and punitive government was waning
they were tired of the scrutiny in romania everyone was watched all the time <unk> had <unk> about what a life in the united states could be
they had to make a decision
we made a plan
after the final show the team returned to new york before traveling back to romania but the coaches had no intention of getting on that plane
martha had an aunt with a place in manhattan that they could use to <unk> for a few days in order to get there <unk> would have to distract his roommate the head of the romanian security detail
the plan was that i will take the secret service guy out to ah shopping and then we meet at the apartment
the morning of march thirty at nineteen <unk> <unk> and her teammates were told they could go shopping as long as they were back in time to board a bus to j f k airport at noon
so we had a little bit of money and we met down at in the hallway and they said okay so you have two hours no funny business no <unk> no eating no nothing
then we all went out the door probably i walked like ten steps and <unk> says <unk>
i need you to come back i started crying i said oh my gosh what have i done wrong this time he said you're gonna have to come back with us in our room i started crying because i thought you know i i mean just the fear of what have i done wrong
<unk> followed <unk> orders and went back to their room with martha
i go back with martha to the hotel room and very unusual behavior she went looked at the the the window when walked back to the door looked to the window walked back to the door i talked to myself what in the world gosh in my head now i'm supposed to be waiting to get beaten up
and i think we waited a good half an hour and then he comes through the door with a this kind of look on his face his face like he was all pale and stuff like that he says <unk> we're not coming back anymore
when i heard that i asked what that's the first time that i i talked and i said what is that well we decided that we're gonna stay here we're not coming back
<unk> and martha asked <unk> to bring back luggage for their families
and then they just told me said um we just have one request please make sure that we're gonna leave this room you don't leave this room for about ten minutes after we're out of this room
and you cannot tell anybody anything until you get on the plane they left and i looked out in the windows and i saw them throwing the luggage into a taxi they jumped in taxi and left
and that's when i knew for sure i said oh we really we really got rid of the <unk> we're not going to get beaten ever again life is gonna be good from now on
meanwhile <unk> got his security guard roommate out of the hotel and into the crowded streets of times square for their own shopping trip
it's a big sale big sale i think they had a feeling that something was going on we had some plans yeah and he would not let me go and suddenly he sees a little store with umbrellas
<unk> had his opportunity
i saw a cab you know stopping down the street i jumped in the cab and i was gone
<unk> made his way to meet <unk> and martha at her aunt's apartment
and when they saw me they jumped up and down that i had made it they were very happy
after <unk> saw the <unk> leave she went out and found her teammates on their shopping expedition and loaded up on chocolate
i did i bought <unk> and i ate even i ate chocolate right when i bought it oh my it was the time of my life
there was no one to stop her at noon as planned the romanian national team boarded a bus to the airport
so we finally got on a bus and the security guy who was already green on his face he was all green and said where's <unk> you know it i said i don't know how should i know maybe they didn't come back to the store yet i have no idea
there was no sign of <unk> martha or <unk>
and so the bus left we got to the airport no <unk> we got to the plane no <unk>
the plane waited three hours on the <unk>
i i couldn't believe it to myself i couldn't believe it until the plane took off and i saw they're not in the plane i said okay now they can't come any more
it's been some time since the united states has had a really top drawer <unk> from the communist bloc of nations but overnight here in washington a triple <unk> by three <unk> became known which has <unk> the american athletic world
romanian gymnastics coach <unk> <unk> one of the world's best his wife martha also a highly regarded trainer and <unk> <unk> the top <unk> for the romanian women's team today they were at the capitol asking a congressman to help <unk> them with their families
the <unk> left a seven year old daughter in romania <unk> <unk> a wife and a young daughter
all i can tell you is is that they are extremely warm and i believe very talented individuals ah who have a great sense of of the desire to be free
the u s already has granted the coaches permission to work and there's no doubt they plan to do what they do best

if it saves energy and gives you performance a boost well when is a shoe just a shoe from american public media this is marketplace tech <unk> the digital economy i'm jack stewart in for molly wood
world athletics the governing body for track and field is set to announce whether it'll ban certain types of shoes
in particular <unk> <unk> shoes have been prominently on the feet of athletes responsible for tumbling race records recently
nike claims the two hundred and fifty dollars sneakers shave up to four percent off a <unk> time so is that technology <unk>
we got hold of iain hunter professor of exercise science at brigham young university as he was with athletes training at b y <unk> indoor track he told us the shoes work by combining foam in the sole with a carbon fiber plate
i think the plate mostly allows for some structure of the shoes
so if that plate wasn't there and you have a <unk> millimeter height off the ground that's just foam and you try running around the corner that's just gonna collapse on you
so that the plate
mainly give structure to the shoe but it does give a small benefit in terms of energy cost
combine that with now you can do higher foam because you can hold everything together with the plate
and you've got a really good pushing into the ground a big displacement of the foot while it interacts with the ground and then pushes off really effectively
so it quite literally puts a spring in your step
yeah it it's not a coiled spring like we're used to but any foam is really a spring this one's just really effective at it
but where's the line that's what the question is now and i think these are either at the line where i'd feel comfortable or a little bit beyond
so you're saying that there could still so be some innovation allowed in shoes we're not going to say everybody must wear the same type of shoe but there must be a limit to it
yeah i i think it's wonderful to have the innovation on what nike has done as ah propel to other companies to catch up and they will catch up
so we could have the standard for <unk> or a road racing as a shoe like the <unk> but then nike or someone will go a little further with it
and we'll end up with like sixteen millimeter foam and enough carbon fiber to hold the structure of it so you're not collapsing but it will just continue on
and the at some point the rules need to just standardize here's what a shoe is
the price of these shoes to us amateurs out there ah it seems incredibly high is it sort of what you would expect for a <unk> running shoe
yeah when they say two hundred and fifty dollars for a pair of shoes that nike has mentioned probably will last year about ninety miles before it's losing some of its effectiveness
that is getting to the point of not outrageous but people are going to be restricted by the cost of that and they'll be looking for cheaper options
if new balance <unk> others start competing with the same quality and performance of shoe and are charging a hundred and fifty nike is gonna have to start dropping their costs down
so i just the natural how marketing works and and it'll all come to an equilibrium over time
i remember reading about the advantages that some forms of artificial legs could give runners potentially over runners with like <unk> legs i mean are are we just reaching a point where kind of sport is hard engineering
it is and and i think it should be but there have to be some restrictions to how far you go
and we we don't want people to be tempted to <unk> their lower legs so they can go from a two fifteen <unk> to a two o five <unk>
our legs aren't built just for running they're built for climbing and swimming and jumping and all kinds of activities
so if you tune the leg to be tuned just for running they'll be great at running but not good at other things
and that that's where you could go if you didn't have rules established
given that these shoes do kind of have a limited life do do athletes train in them and actually run in them in races or do you sort of hold them off for that that performance boost when you really need it
well if they're sponsored by nike they'll do all of their race pace work in those shoes
but if they're buying their own shoes what i typically see is they buy the pair do maybe two workouts in them before the race so they probably have about fifteen to twenty miles on them and then they do the race
and then they'll maybe workout in those ones but buy a new pair before the next race they do
and that's if it's someone that cares about saving a couple minutes on a marathon time
i i think it's somewhere around one or two minutes the benefit that most would get from this shoe
the price of progress i guess iain hunter that he works with u s a track and field
and now with some related links <unk> shoes first came to prominence in twenty sixteen when they were worn by the first three <unk> in the rio olympics men's marathon
an estimated <unk> of the first one hundred <unk> in last year's <unk> marathon were wearing <unk> shoes
that's just two of the statistics that <unk> has pulled together to show the dominance of this tech in various different versions some graphs in there article too from my fellow data nerds
i also got lost in the new wall street journal video on the shoes and the controversy around them which as it says some are calling a seismic shift
so we'll link you to that and a voice you hear on marketplace tech from time to time nick thompson editor in chief of wired magazine is also a keen <unk>
and he set out to put these sneakers to the test himself by running the new york marathon wearing them and crunching all of his data
they felt strange and <unk> at first he says my initial steps reminded me of putting on ice skates and then walking on a rubber mat to the rink
but once i started running the strangeness disappeared and i forgot i was wearing them
more of his experiences and his crunching of the scientific data to see if he experienced the tech of <unk> effect at marketplace tech dot org
i'm jack stewart and that is marketplace tech
this is a p m
the holidays are over it's back to reality for most of us and back to some distant warehouse for a lot of are unwanted gifts
from american public media this is marketplace tech <unk> the digital economy
i'm jack steward and for molly wood
this season's online holiday sales were worth some one hundred and thirty-eight billion dollars to <unk>
but nearly a third of that stuff is expected to be returned according to new research from c b r e a real estate research group
and that's pretty typical thirty percent of online shopping is returned versus eight percent of stuff bought in shops
and all of those returns come with a cost even if that free to us the shoppers
there's the emission from the trucks and planes the waste from packaging and discarded products the cost of finding space for it all or even just checking it out
david <unk> with c b r e says right about now warehouse workers are getting buried
well it's just the flood of packages when you when you think about the way the supply chain is built and designed it really is meant to be as efficient as possible in moving product from the point of production to wherever something is made to the end point the point of consumption
and all of the networks the the the buildings the flow through the buildings the transportation networks even the way the employees are trained to handle the packages are really meant to get that stuff moving out as quickly as possible
are there ways that we could use technology to try to mitigate this problem
in my opinion the real solution is going to be a technological solution at the point of sale so how do you provide the customer better assurance that what they're buying is what they actually want
so the classic example is someone buys three or four shirts with the intention of only keeping one or two of them because they don't know if the size is right they don't know the colors quite can be right they don't know what it's gonna feel like
and i do think there are technologies between augmented reality and virtual reality where we'll be able to shop online and have a more a a sense of an in-person type of experience which i believe will really substantially reduce the number of returns that occur
the other side of it though is that offering that type of free <unk> seamless return policy is really important to keeping customers
do you think we as consumers have a role to play here i mean returns are so easy most of the time that free there're maybe something we don't even think about as much as we should
i think we need to incur some of the cost frankly i do think that the free and painless return system that we've all been accustomed to dealing with is long-term not sustainable
so i do think at some place we need to understand how damaging it is not only to the the retailers that we're we're doing business with but also to the environment
you know one fact that i find shocking frankly is that in the united states alone five billion pounds of return merchandise gets put in the landfill every single year just in the u s
so merchandise that's been handled and enough time has passed between the point of sale to the the return point that has been deemed worthless and it gets thrown away five billion pounds a year
so i mean that it it's just it's it's a destructive type of type of system that we're all taking part in and i think we all need to do our part to make it go away
and one of the ways to do that is to pay for it and when people are asked to pay for something they will be a lot more careful about the way they behave
now the flip side of that is that the consumers have voted overwhelmingly in favor of free and <unk> returns and have said that they will find someone if if you won't give it to me someone else will
so fixing this is not going to be easy it's really hard to imagine the first retailer that's going to be brave enough to turn around and say sure we'll take your returns but it's actually gonna cost you
that was david <unk> with c b r e
and now for some related links
it's impossible to talk about online shopping without mentioning the <unk> that is amazon as <unk> says where it goes other retailers follow
and in the last decade it has set new standards and expectations for delivery pushing its competitors to do the same
<unk> has the five ways which amazon changed shopping in the twenty tens
with returns often being free it's really not surprising that consumers aren't aware of the real costs
or maybe we just like to assume or hope that those unwanted items that we so carefully return with all their original packages intact are then <unk> and <unk>
the idea that a good chunk of them end up in <unk> is well as the ali times calls it a hidden environmental crisis
david <unk> explained that the logistics operation is set up to run smoothly in one direction getting things to us
there are a lot of efforts to streamline the opposite direction too though there are companies making it that business to help retailers and consumers
so if you do ever step out from behind your computer and actually go to malls a little more frequently than me you've probably noticed some return bars where you can drop off purchases and have someone else just deal with all that sending it back stuff for you
and for the sellers these companies promise to analyze returns and the reasons for them and reduce the packaging they need vogue business breaks it down
but i think really the new year's resolution that i'm taking away from all of this is just to buy less stuff i'm jack steward and that's marketplace tech
this is a p m
hello to <unk> and to all the new marketplace investors who joined us before the end of the decade
thank you for being part of this community of donors who believe in the importance of trustworthy independent news and information
it's your ongoing support that keeps us strong and helps make people smarter everywhere thanks again and happy new year
the u s needs a lot more hospital beds fast
can tech help us build them
from american public media this is marketplace tech <unk> the digital economy
i'm molly wood
states and cities are rushing to find hospital beds to prepare for an increase in patients suffering from <unk>
in new york makeshift hospitals are going up in central park and a navy hospital ship is in the city's harbor
its <unk> convention center has been converted into a temporary medical facility and the u s army corps of engineers is looking to convert empty hotels and other buildings into hospitals across the country
now as part of its response to the coronavirus the chinese government built two giant hospitals in ten days
and we wondered could we build hospitals that fast here in the u s and what tech exists to innovate on the construction process
chris <unk> is working on it he's the c e o of the manufacturing and design firm <unk> which specializes in modular medical facility construction
we deliver acute care facilities think about hospitals and we design them digitally and and we manufacture them in our plan
imagine a a big complex lego that we can ship out and then when we ah when we when we get there we assemble it as a completed building
and and all of this relies on a bunch of technology that we use the the the digital design and the supply chain and the machines that make these parts real together
but but at the end we take raw material and we turn it into hospitals
and about how long does that take
yeah typical building may take twelve to sixteen months to make
and and we do it in four months now and every day we're you know we have a team that's working to make it faster and faster
yeah you know i asked that because no pressure but it seems as though we are going to need some health care facilities quickly
how do you how do you see you know your company being a part of that
so a few weeks ago when the size of this pandemic became clear
our team had to <unk> on we were making permanent hospitals and we were doing them really fast but we had to think about how to take this problem um and put it through our machine <unk>
and figure out how to do that so that we could get hospital beds quicker
we set out immediately to design a twenty-four bed <unk>
um ah
a <unk> is a it's a mobile isolation care unit this <unk> it it's got three jobs
and the first one it's it's got ah protect the <unk> health care workers
and and then there's this the second thing that they've got to do which is they they're designed to protect the <unk> existing capacity
and and then the final one is we're trying to make these <unk> ah become a permanent and flexible asset that that that helps serve the health system go on forwards
so i mean they're institutional grade they're reusable
it's a it's a fleet of i c u rooms that gets to be moved in the future to wherever the hot spot is
how much do they cost
these things will be around two to three hundred thousand dollars a bed ah in the beginning and then those those prices will drop down
so these are significantly less expensive but they're still high-tech ah devices that are <unk> full of equipment and <unk> and electronics and they're still pretty expensive boxes
can you tell us at all where these projects might be happening like where you're putting up these <unk>
well we're we're we're not putting them up yet um so it's still it's still going to production in two weeks
um the first ones could be in any of the spots that are needed
so um obviously we've been in ah pretty heavy discussions in new york we've been in discussions ah in in georgia and there's a big ah there's a big delta between there's two places but it really doesn't matter to us where they're needed
they can go just as easily to one or the other
and then just out of curiosity is it sort of like a modular house where it's basically sort of <unk> and then it just comes on a big truck
you know it it parts of it are so ah ah a lego analogy is really a pretty good one
if you think about a lego kit or advanced one um it has it has different types of parts
some of them are <unk> and some of them are um are are custom parts and some of them are little pieces that can be used in a thousand different different ways
and and we're agnostic about it we think that there's just a a value stream that goes from raw material and it's converted into a usable building
and and the process that it goes through is a whole lot of different stages
we're just trying to find an optimal one
there's not always a right path because of ah but in in fact we're using many of the things that we do for regular hospitals right now
but we've we've made different changes the foundation for example is significantly different on a <unk>
it doesn't need all of the <unk> that that a acute care hospital may have a that you know that has a <unk> lifespan
so so the the idea is we we think of it as completed parts but every <unk> completed
and it goes together in a form of <unk>
and it's kind of the way they build a new boeing seven <unk> <unk> it's not made on an assembly line the way you you know you think of an assembly line
it's it's made in chunks that are made all over the world and they've all brought together charles and put together as an oh yeah in in a matter of days
so that's more like what we're doing with with <unk>
got it what makes these specific to medical facilities
what kind of certification and technology goes into that
the hospitals are really heavily regulated
and and if you if you try and understand which ones there are you it's it's it's a long list
and so what i would just simply say is um um these things are dealing with life safety at an institutional level they're dealing with emergency power critical care um operations
they're dealing with temperature control that's based on air exchanges which allow you to evacuate ah disease and infection
they are designed to be visible and operational high performances if you will
right so these these nurses and doctors are under enormous amount of pressure
and what you're trying to do is create a a place which is safe for them to work but visually ah controlled so they can see everything at once
and you know that's what we focused on we how we make this really a beautiful ah elegantly simple <unk> visually controlled device that is technologically empowered
and can be deployed really fast and still be done with the stuff that's available today not the stuff that we wish was available today
you said that you're trying to take a typical construction time for a building from twelve to eighteen months down to four months
how long will it take to construct these <unk>
so the the first one will roll off in june the the end of may and it'll be operational a week later
and then after that they'll just keep coming as long as they're needed
so once the line is loaded then think of it as just a continuous river that keeps dropping them out
so there's about ten large modules in each one of these and every day and a half another ten will be ready to be shipped
let me ask you this it's clearly a technological miracle in a lot of ways
june is a long ways away do you wish that you had started getting called sooner
yes necessity is the mother of invention and i think that we're as a nation in the midst of a necessity
i like what i see in terms of the human spirit coming together to try and solve hard problems right now
chris <unk> is c e o of the modular medical facility construction firm <unk>
he said the company is talking right now with a few states about building the <unk> he mentioned
but so far hasn't <unk> any deals
and now for some related links to that point about whether <unk> is already building facilities
fast company has a piece on how yes we have the technology and the modular construction expertise to get buildings up quickly
but we also have a lot of logistics and <unk> problems
the army corps of engineers as you heard wants to convert existing facilities
but for the reasons that <unk> mentioned a hotel or convention center is not ideal for the job those buildings are hard to <unk>
they need h <unk> systems that can prevent infectious diseases from being pumped into every room and they have plenty of other medical needs as well
the piece points to some modular design companies that are creating medical pods that can be built quickly
some others in addition to <unk>
but since each city and state has its own rules around construction and permits and even just a shortage of actual land to put modules on
it's a tough problem to solve quickly at a time when speed is what we need
and here is what else we're watching in tech
the wall street journal reports that no surprise the u s is already starting to track people's smartphone data to analyze movements and ultimately build a database that can show at a national level
how well social distancing measures are working and where people might be gathering together in large groups so that authorities can both crack down and potentially predict a future outbreak
and look we're gonna talk a lot more about this later in the week this need for a data-driven response to this outbreak and the fact that this is useful existing data
and the fact that it is also likely to become a privacy invasion at a grand scale
<unk> has a piece about how singapore is collecting data in a more <unk> way through an app called <unk>
that's what m i t is trying to do with its app safe paths but both cases rely on people downloading the app and using it and voluntarily reporting information
in singapore there is a more central authority that can you know make people do the thing
that's a lot harder in the u s and since the data already exists in one giant cookie jar full of delicious quarantine baked cookies
it's gonna be real hard to convince the cookie monster to find another treat
i'm molly wood and that's marketplace tech
this is a p m
this marketplace podcast is supported by technology dot <unk> jobs dot com
do you have a big tech ideas sometimes it's too big take them to <unk> they are making tech a huge part of their future from a r mirrors to apps that guide you through the store

how amazon has become a big part of this covid nineteen life and in more ways than you might think from american public media this is marketplace tech <unk> the digital economy
i'm kimberly adams and from molly wood
as we continue to deal with the coronavirus outbreak many of us are doing more online shopping and relying on amazon more than ever amazon has hired about eighty thousand new workers to keep up with the demand
and following employee walk out since protests the company announced thursday it would start taking employees temperatures at work and provide face masks
amazon in the era of <unk> is the topic for this weeks quality assurance where we take a second look at the big story in the news matt day covers amazon from bloomberg
and we talked about whither the company fit into that now crucial designation of essential
obviously a good deal of amazon is kind of essential in this times and particularly if you're somebody with mobility issues you're somebody who for for health reasons doesn't want to even take the risk going to ah going to a supermarket or <unk> store that remains open yeah you you are relying on <unk> and
you know on on that regard if you are trying to get drug user or hand sanitizer or wipes chances are using amazon dot com but one of the <unk> that we found of this environment lists if you talked to amazon's workers is that they are still shipping a lot of <unk> stuff
amazon's digital door remain open for for books for you know toys games for kinda everything else they have been sale online anyway they are still shipping them and there're workers in facilities around the country you know still risking their own health going in to work
um and the service of moving those goods to your door too
we are talking about e-commerce but amazon also has a lot of other business right
right right and there is just a bunch of other areas that you know they stand to to likely benefits from this you know one of them it doesn't get talked about quite as much as as delivery but ah amazon web services their cloud computing group which you know is essentially on-demand software or or or processing power
you know businesses with employees working from home are ah are making more use of that ah analysts say and then you know if you're sitting at home watching netflix or using a variety of internet services a lot of the <unk> of of those ah live on amazon web services and so
you know this is kind of the conventional wisdom that they stand to gain ah too from this ah this environment right now
you know so many of our conversations are about what happens after we come out of this even though it's hard to even envision when that is or or what the world is gonna look like at that point
but when we look at amazon a a year from now what kind of stories do you think you'll be writing about this company and and its business
i think we're gonna be writing about you know how this you know as as catastrophic are gonna been as it's putting to be globally um this is the kind of the thing that amazon was built for you know they've spent most of the last decade building a a giant logistics network in the u s and and parts of europe to
really in an unprecedented way get goods to you quicker um to to every doorstep they can access they've been you know <unk> e-commerce since that term was new um so i think in a lot of ways their company built to take advantage of this
and now it hasn't been a a glorious couple of months for them they've had some complaints from workers about you know <unk> goods and the rate at which they've been worked there's been you know the the usual criticisms from u s senators about giving ah workers better pay
which has been an issue at amazon um often on for a while you know but but to a large extent this company was designed to handle these kind of challenges so i think you know if this indeed means a a sort of permanent increase in online commerce you know amazon would stand ah stand to gain a tremendous amount from it
another question is just whether they're able to capitalize on that you know the way their business leaders would hope or if some of the the p r backlash related to some of these controversies ah <unk> them
we have seen protests this week by delivery workers and people working in amazon's warehouses will this have an effect on the company's operations
the the issue with amazon it's it's been a complicated story for a long time but one of the things this crisis is doing is some of those folks are kind of taking an opportunity to speak in a way that they haven't before there was a a <unk> in an amazon warehouse just outside of detroit
it was the third um you know <unk> in three days at an amazon facility you know across the country and that's just something you don't see very often
you know so clearly you know workers who feel under extreme amounts of pressure themselves um think that this is an opportunity for them to you know maybe ask things of management that would have been um more difficult under this sort of business as usual conditions
bloomberg's mat day amazon also says that's no longer going to sell <unk> masks and other urgently needed covid nineteen related supplies to regular customers
the company has a new section of its website just for these products and says it will prioritize them for hospitals and government agencies
and now for some related links matt day recently wrote about amazon surging and hiring to meet all the demand from people stuck at home due to coronavirus
and some of that hiring last month was happening at job <unk> where people weren't exactly able to practice social distancing
amazon said it's since updated its recruiting strategies too according to math reports keep applicants safe
and my colleague andy <unk> covered those amazon protests we were talking about
and speaking of safety instacart says it's going to start providing full service shoppers with a safety kit including a mask hands sanitizer and a thermometer
shoppers have to request the kits but they are supposed to be free you can find the links to all the stories at market place dot org
and here is what else for watching after years of negotiations a bunch of lawsuits a department of justice investigation millions of dollars in lobbying and some extra stays at the trump hotel
the merger between <unk> and sprint is finally done that deal is worth about <unk> billion dollars and leaves us with just three big wireless networks a t and t verizon and <unk> and no one else

this is a p m
huge number of people signing up for unemployment are exposing an infrastructure problem in the states
really really old technology
from american public media this is marketplace tech <unk> the digital economy i'm molly wood
new <unk> governor recently went on t v asking for volunteers who know <unk> a more than a <unk> computer programming language
that because the state's unemployment benefits system runs on a <unk> <unk> that can't keep up with the volume of requests for financial help
and new jersey isn't alone several states not to mention a lot of financial institutions are all at the mercy of these very old systems running on a programming language that isn't even taught in schools anymore
joseph <unk> a cybersecurity consultant and author of the book cybersecurity for <unk>
well first of all there are many financial institutions that use <unk> with <unk> for back-end processing of transactions and batch processing
i think they probably have things in a lot better shape because they have the resources in-house
in some cases they've replaced the systems at great expense over recent years in some cases they're doing it now
and in some cases they've made the decisions to actually train people to be able to support these systems going forward
but when it comes to government and i would say probably even worse in the state governments than than in the federal
you have many systems that seem to hang around for a very long time
one of the questions that i i posed ah in the last week is simply if god forbid this pandemic continued for several more months and all americans had to vote in the presidential election remotely
um ah
do all fifty states actually have computer systems that could accommodate that volume of ballots going out and in to be counted processed in a secure fashion you know you know in in any reasonable time frame
and i'm afraid of what the answer to that question might be we simply have a lot of legacy systems involved in various state processes and they are not meant they were never designed to accommodate you know mass loads that could suddenly happen now
um ah
and it's a lot harder to scale these legacy systems you know
newer technologies scale much better and i'm afraid of what's out there you know at the state level
um and i'm sure there're some in the federal government but you know this ah ah after this pandemic is over it's really gonna be time to take a serious look at a lot of these older systems and evaluate whether they really are reliable only because we haven't had to make changes or they're really reliable
and i think in many cases we'll find it's the former
right i mean it seems like this is sort of an an invisible infrastructure problem in america that in some ways is as expensive and difficult to fix as road and bridges
it's as expensive and perhaps in some ways more dangerous because you don't notice it until the problem happens
right you have people who desperately need money because their work suddenly ended they place an unemployment claim and they can't get it processed
that can be dangerous people could be low on food and other supplies and it's not like they can easily obtain them now either
and i think that's precisely the issue with these older systems
often we assume that they're reliable until it's too late and the problem ah you know has hit and at that point you know you've got tactical problem how do we process these ah unemployment claims
and a strategic problem how do we make sure this never happens again in the future
you're saying that even if we were able to bring a lot of programmers out of retirement that these systems simply may not ever be able to handle the load that is being put on them now
it may be possible to scale them up with improved hardware but that's gonna be very expensive number one
and they don't scale as simply as more modern systems do so you know the fact that you're hiring programmers out of retirement and people don't live forever
you're not gonna have an endless supply of programmers who programmed in the seventies ah in the workforce
and i'm not saying that these systems aren't reliable they may be very reliable for what they do now
um ah
but we have to accept the fact that systems may need to be changed and may need to scale up suddenly and we may not be able to do with the existing technology and human resources
i mean i have been at companies that <unk> and it is hard and it's really expensive and what does that look like at a sort of state and national level what kind of investment in terms of both technology and money would that take
um the thing to keep in mind is there's also a political problem with things like this
you know if you're a state elected official and you have to budget a large amount of money for replacing the system no user of that system initially benefits from it
so you need to have the political um will which i think after this we will to invest the money before problems happen understanding that you're investing for the future
we should have our infrastructure set up that if there is an emergency in which people are dying the governor should be focused on people not on you know technical <unk> in an unemployment system
right this is a speculative and ah vaguely nightmare scenario but at what point do you think companies
like amazon or microsoft or google might approach states and the federal government they maybe you need a a private solution a <unk> infrastructure for some of this
um i don't know if they already have they they may have approached them years ago and been told that the system is working we have no need to replace it um i don't know
ah but you know i i'm sure that after this is all over as the governor himself said we're gonna have that <unk>
and then after that <unk> there just gonna be evaluations of many different options ah as to how to proceed and some of those will involve ah utilizing third-party resources potentially
ah by the way you could have a cloud that's run by the government it could be a private cloud system it could be their own infrastructure
ah you know there are many many options but moving away from the <unk> code running on the <unk> to a more modern platform might allow for greater you know scalability suddenly if needed ah as well as for easier maintenance if you know code changes need to be made
and you you certainly not gonna need to go begging for ah programmers at a press conference
just <unk> cause the cybersecurity consultant
and now for some related links we got a link to that <unk> report from the government accountability office which found that among other things the department of defense uses <unk> floppy disks to coordinate some of the country's nuclear forces
you can see why they wanna get that big cloud project moving i guess
in other infrastructure news m i t technology review has a piece this week about how generally speaking the internet is holding up shockingly well in the midst of our big transition from work and school to home
it points out that cloud service providers and also streaming media and telecom companies
so thank amazon or comcast netflix microsoft google they all put a lot of money into new internet infrastructure in the past decade or so in order to keep delivering their services
and now this current crisis is generating even more investment
now if only we could do the same for the power grid and the bridges and the state and county <unk>
and here is what else for watching in tech a brutal week at yelp
the company that is basically built on small businesses is laying off a thousand people and <unk> another eleven hundred according to <unk>
yelp c e o will take no salary for the rest of the year and the company is cutting executive pay by twenty to thirty percent
also on thursday microsoft released a report about remote work trends based on data from its teams product
the company of course reported a huge increase in the number of people using teams
but the report has some super interesting data
for example it notes that people are using video obviously in their meetings a lot more than they ever did before
a thousand percent more in march in fact
but the u s <unk> a little bit in terms of video calling
in norway and the netherlands about sixty percent of calls include video but only thirty-eight percent of american meetings have the camera turned on
i mean listen i'm just gonna confess that i straight up refused to join a meeting by video on thursday because i for one can no longer stand the sight of my own forehead
i see you america or rather i only hear you

facebook users in illinois could each be in line for a couple of hundred dollars for privacy violations what does that mean for the rest of us
from american public media this is marketplace tech <unk> the digital economic i'm jack steward and from molly wood
about a decade ago facebook started automatically tagging people whose faces its algorithms had recognized in our uploaded photos at the time it seemed like magic
but this week facebook has agree to pay five hundred and fifty million dollars over claims that tool violated privacy rights the settlement has in illinois which has strict laws protecting biometric data
facebook revealed the settlement agreement at the same time as its quarterly financial results this week and they by the way show the revenue was up twenty-five percent to <unk> billion dollars at the end of last year
for today's quality assurance we have natasha singer a tech reporter for the new york times to explained what this settlement means
so illinois has the toughest biometric privacy law in the united states there are only three states that have these kind of laws
and so biometric privacy pertains to your fingerprints or facial scans for facial recognition and so in illinois the law says that companies can't collect that kind of information like facial data for facial recognition without getting written permission from someone
and also they can't collect the data without telling somebody how long they're gonna keep it and so facebook users in illinois sued facebook saying that it had collected their facial information and had not obtained their kind of affirmative <unk> permission and had not told them how long that facebook was gonna keep it
um facebook says that these claims are not true but facebook said that it settled this lawsuit because it was gonna you know drag on and take up too much resources and was better for everybody and the <unk> if they settled the lawsuit
do you think the size of this um facebook settlement might serve as a warning to other companies so considering this sort of technology
it it feels like maybe when facebook introduced things like facial recognition they were just looking at fun ways of using it and maybe some of the other implications are now coming to light
if you think about a face print right it's like the facial equivalent of your fingerprint and you might want to use your fingerprint for fun ways
but we kind of this really know that your fingerprint has all kinds of implications and it's unique so even the notion of facebook turning on facial recognition by default for fun things is problematic first of all in illinois
but also to a lot of people who are concerned that the problem with facial recognition is that it can be used to identify people without their knowledge at a distance
and so it <unk> your ability to be anonymous both online and in public
do you think there's a chance we'll see companies basically <unk> to just not collecting any data like this ah ah at the risk of it somehow being regulated in the future
certainly i think companies that are having similar technology and they have illinois users must be thinking about it right cause it be think about like <unk> <unk> which are spreading everywhere
would your <unk> camera is gonna um take images of people and it's used for facial recognition right so that like it can recognize your babysitter so that they can come in in illinois you need consent for stuff like that
and so what does that mean for all kinds of devices that collect ambient biometric data um i think we don't have the answer to that i think that companies now because of the size of the facebook settlement are going to have to think about what their illinois plan is
i can't imagine that they want to have one set of software for illinois and another for the rest of the country first of all you know that's just from a business perspective inefficient
but second of all you know you don't want people in other parts of the country saying well you turned that off for illinois why haven't you turned it off for us
and so we're seeing for example with the california privacy law that there a number of companies microsoft apple have said we're gonna honor the rights under the california privacy law for everybody in the united states
it feels like when we talk about these privacy stories we we talk about you know the value of your privacy or the value of your data and it's always very hard to put a number on that
do you think things like this illinois settlement ah ah are starting to move in that direction and putting a a dollar value on these things
so i think the notion that there's a trade and you're trading your data for you know services so you're giving up some of your privacy is the silicon valley framing um that you're getting value for data
but when we think of a trade you know what you're giving up and what you're getting but when you give up your data you have no idea how it's gonna be used
it can be used <unk> for all time for all kinds of purposes for which you didn't give it and i would argue that it's not a trade it's not a fair trade and i would also argue that um data is not property
in europe security and privacy are fundamental human rights and if we think of other fundamental human rights like the right of free speech you wouldn't say i'm trading my free speech for facebook services
so this notion that we're trading our right to privacy for services i think is just a problematic framing
for the new york times according to the chicago tribune a federal called judge must approve the facebook settlement
and then members of the class action
claims for part of the money
for some related links today check out the <unk> story at the new york times for more detail on the settlement and next steps as well as coverage from the chicago tribune for more and why illinois has become so important for privacy lawsuits
and then if you didn't read it a couple of weeks ago well set aside a good few minutes to completely digest the new york times story the secretive company that might end privacy as we know it it's about <unk> a i a little-known company that created an app for law enforcement to use facial recognition
as the article says without public scrutiny more than six hundred law enforcement agencies have started using <unk> in the past year and while big tech companies are at least facing some scrutiny for their facial recognition efforts this company seems to have flown under the radar until now
well so what you might think i've done nothing wrong why does it matter if my face is recognized in public privacy <unk> would argue that we're just not aware yet of everything that we're giving up
the new york times took the feeds from three public <unk> in new york and photos from employer websites
and using that they match two thousand seven hundred and fifty faces it's just one example they found a professor on his way to lunch with a job candidate
as the times says our experiment shows that a person equipped with just a few cameras and facial recognition technology can learn people's daily habits when they arrive at the office each day who they get coffee with whether they left work early
the professor's reaction when he was told was oh my god that's unbelievable but these days it really is easier and easier to believe
i'm jack steward and that's <unk> tech
this is a p m
summer camp fresh air burned fires or you know stay inside and learning how to shoot youtube videos
american public media this is marketplace tech <unk> the digital economy
i'm <unk> kim in for molly wood
summer vacation is rapidly approaching for some families that means sending kids to camp some of those are youtube camps
these are essentially places where kids can learn how to create <unk> youtube videos and channels
the demand has grown as kids want to emulate the online stars they watch
julie jargon is the family and tech columnist at the wall street journal when she wrote about the trend
she said kids learn how to light shoot and edit videos also how to develop their personal brains
they're teaching them to create their own unique voice so that they can stand out in the crowd of youtubers and develop original content
um but you know a lot of the kids i talked to they just want to shoot videos of themselves playing <unk>
so there's a lot of that already but that's what a lot of kids are interested in doing they they watch the youtubers playing video games and then they want to do it themselves
yeah i can say it i hear youtube camp and my initial reaction is gross
but i know that's just my like me being <unk> and reactionary ah help me understand the value of this
well you know i mean i think that's the reaction actually of a lot of parents and i there is a debate ah raging a lot of households right now about whether to allow children to have their own youtube channels
and a lot of the you know the first time reaction from parents is no
you know there are there are a lot of concerns about kids being exposed publicly and being open to bullying and predators and all that stuff that we worry about on the internet
but a lot of the parents i spoke to who also shared those concerns you know kind of went about it thoughtfully and said well my kid wants to do something they're passionate about it how do i foster that
and is there a way to look at youtube as a medium that can be an outlet for their creativity to develop the skills that they might not be able to develop on their own at home
and also how can those skills trans like to other life experiences
um and also just learning the poise and the composure of speaking on film and addressing audiences
you know those are all good things for kids to know how to do
yes summer is is i guess is like blank canvas for kids to do whatever they want or i guess what their parents want them to learn
and are parents more valuing developing digital skills than they were in the past
i think so i think there's a growing awareness of the fact that these kind of skills could be useful for future careers i mean gaming it alone is such a huge industry
a lot of kids go to coding camps to learn how to code video games
um so there are a lot of digital sort of skills that ah you know older generation of parents don't have and they're seeing that it could be applicable to future career choices for their children
some parents are you know they are increasingly concerned about screen time and like social media and spending all day video gaming they even if it is for learning
so what makes a family more wary of tech compared to other families that are like go for it
you know i i was just think it comes down to an individual choice and and individual feelings about technology some families just really embrace it and they don't want their kids to be behind
um and they feel like if their kids aren't learning these skills or aware of what's going on on social media and the internet more broadly that they will somehow be social <unk> or they won't have the skills to be competitive in you know in the future workforce
other parents are just really cautious i mean it's not what we ah grew up with
and so there you know you hear the horror stories and you you hear about online bullying and youtube is a very public forum and people can leave you know mean comments
and ah you know is a child really ready to deal with that um you know they are are they <unk> ready and emotionally ready to um let it roll off their skin when someone posts a mean comment about their video
um that's a difficult thing for adults to even face um that kind of criticism from the trolls and so parents have to really prepare their kids for that
i mean there are things you can do you can moderate the comments that are posted on youtube you can turn them off um you can make a youtube channel private so no one can see it
that sort of defeats the whole purpose of posting on youtube though because it's meant to be shared and um youtube videos are meant to be commented on so um
it's just a whole new world that parents are trying to navigate and and i think it really comes down to personal choice as to whether you you want your kids to jump into that world or ah maybe kind of keep them away from it to the extent possible
let's talk a little more about kind of the fame side of things some camps that you found were <unk> against building expectations that your kid gonna be a star
but other camps were like using it as a marketing point
anything problematic with that
yeah i mean ah what what the reality of you know what are the chances that your child is going to achieve some sort of youtube fame
probably pretty slim considering how many videos are on youtube and sort of the mystery about what um the algorithm chooses to push up you know you can create a video and get no views
i mean it's really hard sometimes to sift through all the videos and find a video on a particular topic um you know and there are something like a a billion hours of youtube videos viewed daily
um so how do you break through the clutter and make your video stand out
i mean and you know i think parents have to be realistic with themselves and with their children that just because he posted a video to youtube doesn't mean you're gonna start you know having a million subscribers and
right
and you know advertising and sponsorship contracts and that kind of thing
i mean there are certainly people have achieved fame and fortune on youtube but just like with anything else you know you're not gonna become necessarily the next star n b a player just because you go to a basketball camp
so i think you know you have to you have to just be realistic and and understand what you and your what your child want to achieve with their youtube channel
julie jargon writes about family and tech at the wall street journal i ask her if this means more kids will be coming home from camps starting conversation by saying
hey guys medicine here i've gotten a couple of great things to share with you julie said yeah that's already happening even outside of the camp
and now for some related links interested to know how youtube is working to weed out the objectionable videos that get uploaded
vox sat down with neal <unk> the company's chief product officer he says it's not about just finding bad videos and removing them it's about constantly updating the user guidelines for computers and human workers to follow
among the staggering stats you'll read five hundred hours of video content get uploaded every minute more than ten thousand people have been hired to make the final decision of whether a video stays or goes
and <unk> says corpus no fewer than seven times corpus as in the full body of work on youtube
let's see what else we got how about the promise of making money through your youtube channel
business insider lays out the path to getting your channel into the youtube partner program first thing you have to do in order to be eligible
have at least a thousand subscribers and your audience has to have watched four thousand hours of you in the past year
there's a lot more that goes into it from there like different tiers at which you can access more tools it's a little daunting
and finally learning camps are a way to combat the dreaded summer slide or that thing where your kid gets <unk> during the months when they're not in school
lots of articles churned out every year at this time with ways to fight it we found some articles in parenting and read brightly that suggest apps to help
we are after all a tech show

americas nineteen <unk> world cup
six foot one big unit of a defender
u s soccer athlete to the ah twice over a man with over hundred international appearances
the play just thirteen minutes in the entire tournament
the final thirteen minutes of the final dead rubber game
to be told that you're gonna be on the world cup team but you're not gonna play
it i l tell you what it is that you can see emotional but it it killed me killed me you know did i wake up at night now i wouldn't sleep at night
i was i wouldn't sleep at night i was so angry that i didn't get to play i was so angry at that time i'd rather have not played those thirteen minutes than to have been given a courtesy twelve minutes in a game
do you have any idea how insane is to give just thirteen minutes of play
no even real play but to congestion patronizing throw away play
its madness then very nearly broke the man
i like closure i like closure i like knowing why i fucked up i like knowing what i did wrong so i can fix it and i couldn't figure out what i did wrong in <unk>
from a soccer aspect of what i do wrong in <unk> <unk> to not deserve to play
what did i do to piss off steve <unk> what did i say to piss off steve <unk> to have a personal thing against me to not even consider me as a player to be on the starting eleven
and then one day
not long after he returned home from france
i got a letter
it was from steve <unk>
a letter that i did not open for almost two and half years and just sat in my door i didn't want open it i didn't want anything to do with it
what did the letter say <unk>
i just remember the quote that said with hindsight is twenty twenty and i just kind of said they're gone okay so you you you this is the way you apologize
what did it feel to read that letter
i never got closure i never got told what was in good enough about my game he inserted madness to everybody's life not just me i think he did it to <unk> and and i think he did that to a lot of guys i think that at that time but it's now not not a big deal
but at the time you know i i go back and i just said he screwed mentally with me like no other coach has ever done to me
did you ever write a letter back to steve <unk>
no
if you're gonna write a letter back what would you say
i think i would just wrote why that is just why why
how many letters did you write steve
i only wrote a letter to <unk> <unk> i didn't write to anybody else
it said there is a phrase said that you said with twenty twenty hindsight you would have done something different with the us what would you have done differently
twenty twenty hindsight i i should have found a way to get him on that field because i think his experience and is veteran ship would have affected the team in a very positive way to this day i feel badly that <unk> <unk> didn't play more than what he did
this is american fiasco

a very personal first draft of the history at twenty twenty we've been reminded how important human connections can be so how we find those connections that this week on the united states of anxiety subscribe
this is american fiasco a show about people who communicated their feelings in writing and the days before
were a thing
i'm roger bennett
u s coach steve <unk> he was smart enough to know that it is only as good as his last win
world cup
so it wasn't a question of if he be <unk> but rather of when
secretary general of the u s soccer federation
did you speak to steve after the game
yeah of course
what did he say
i was devastated and there are times when you you you get too hard and there are times where you hug
and at that time we just needed a couple hugs we'll face the realities in a little while but right now you just let it sink
here the the last team ah in the world cup thirty-two of thirty-two teams <unk> have changed
i can only think like the godfather when they
i don't think it was quite as bad as that
a day off than last the <unk> steve told the washington post he wanted to remain head coach and that he wouldn't let a few disgruntled players dictate his future
but things change quickly
after his boss u s soccer federation president alan <unk> invited him to breakfast in paris
ominously
that breakfast was first thing monday morning
i offer my resignation because one i felt it was the right thing to do cause i'd lost three games in a world championship
and i didn't want alan to feel as if he needed to fire me and before he could get it out of his mouth i offered to him to resign from the national team
you told the media this was not steve's fault this was not the players fault they played their hearts out you are very diplomatic man allan but what were you really thinking at that moment
bitterly disappointed ah really really was ah and deep down ah i guess ah upset right or wrong and i i was second guessing myself about the decision to keep steve
it was sort of like all fears that i had all along had just been realized
so you're angry yourself
i wasn't angry but i am you know my moment of reflection was
this is what i was afraid of
your worst case scenario would come true
yes
now i interviewed nearly two dozen people for this story and i only met one before anything even near relation after the nineteen ninety world cup was done
can you guess who that is
i'm fine with that that we loss fuck that sucks mad so i am cutting so much guys
even though as a team we had you know we we we were in last place for me it wasn't a bad cut
god you got to understand is defeated teammate they are burning their <unk> smashing beer bottles railing at the heavens about which gods they must have offended to be laid so low
and this guy he's just smiling
i was just happy go lucky <unk> and that's i just do was throughout the whole thing and so that moment was for me it was
i'm i'm i'm fine guys
and what do you guys complaining about you guys are the ones that can cause this whole thing and you you know you if you've getting mad at me signing a contract but ah come on
oh
it wasn't just <unk> innate ability to make lemonade out of lemons that got him through
it was the job offer he got the night off the <unk> again
right after dinner i got a phone call from my agent who who who was at the hotel and um <unk> <unk>
just explain who they are
the <unk> <unk> abbott says
top five german teams i don't know about all time but over the last twenty-five thirty years they've been pretty much in the top five top eight in in in the <unk> and ah
end up signing the contract at that night pretty much i think you know i was making making thirty grand in the m l s a year and you know i has been offering you know one point three one point four million
so it it it was a no it was a no brainer
so that this to be clear unless yeah it that everyone is going mad like play of popping off play a self <unk> plays a burning down if you like i'm doing great guy
you will like at wedding everybody else was at funeral
yeah right ah totally one hundred percent yet it's it's crazy ah how it works out right like so like ah it was such a bad thing for so many people and for me it was
it ended up changing my life in probably the best way ever that one be fishing and i wouldn't be got a gulf balls off my back deck and
yeah though really that's crazy oh we you you think about yeah and i never thought about it that way
is now the local icon for its major league soccer team in columbus ohio slammed locked nowhere near the ocean
on a local lake
press officer jim
with a slightly sour memory that has never been able to shrug off
the <unk> the garbage cans were overflowing with suits that were just like
complete disrespect for what they were given these were fancy clothes given to the players by a proud u s soccer federation backing more optimistic days
navy blue <unk> all tailored with the u s national team crest <unk> on the breast pocket they were meant to be worn proudly on game day before the players changed to go on the field but instead the teen trash them
and it's it's almost like the to me like the american flag you know that that that was showing you are a u s national team player
and you decide to throw it away i just it was the the the mood was so bad
jim frost stayed in the game of football he just decided to avoid all football players these days he works in the world
<unk> <unk> he never represented the united states again he played out his career in m l s then tried his hand at being a general manager finishing with the l a galaxy
still <unk> remains a familiar face of u s soccer to the state he's fox sports league <unk> for the world cup in russia
<unk> also found time to keep recording the hits his new album sunshine he just came out
john <unk> the captain for not quite life retired from m l s in two thousand and three
became an analyst for television and radio
this year everyone elder he mounted an outside a campaign to become president of u s soccer and he attracted a lot of attention but ultimately
not a lot of votes
david regime became the general manager of the national team in his native <unk>
still dreams of coaching in america one day
you do know that the u s men's national team needs a head coach david
yeah i heard that and it's a dream that i would like to touch him for leaving this earth
you and i goose again
oh yeah no problem
you might recall steve <unk> started
in the nineteen <unk> world cup
spent his entire time in france on the bench
he got his revenge in two thousand two
beat out for the starting lineup
maybe comma does exist after all
played for ten seasons in major league soccer and then transitioned into a front office role
senior vice president for the league
cause of improving the game in the united states
we are in the inner <unk> we're in the jeff <unk> office
this is where all of the coaches and gyms will call me on monday ah describing the pain they've undergone with either poor <unk> or poor discipline
or both
or both yes
and i'm looking at an incredibly clean desk clean desk clean mind
next to a picture of his children there's a framed photo of that notorious red card he got playing against mexico in nineteen <unk>
a habit up to remind me that you can control things about yourself but you can't control what other people do and the only thing you can do is control what you can and
i don't believe it was a red card but that doesn't matter it was a red card and i hurt my team and there were ramifications because of the red card professionally and personally
which brings us back to steve <unk>
this career in reverse front loading the big dream job before drifting back towards the roots of the game
after france <unk> went on to coach the costa rican national team and had spent some time at the club level coaching the los angeles galaxy
today steve is head coach of the california <unk> state university
so this is the jersey that was worn in the fifa world cup in france nineteen <unk> ah this was presented to be ah prior to the tournament beginning
ran steve <unk> modest office
to be honest
lee showing us the <unk> hanging on his wall one in particular has a place of honor
but the red short <unk> jersey signed by all the players have participated in the world cup in france ah again very proud to have had the opportunity to coach these men
does it not conjure even a hint a hint of a dark memory of challenge times when your eyes look at it
oh certainly i mean you know it's like i've told people i've experienced the highs of highs and lows of lows and and it's all part of the journey
that jersey represents to me the entire lead up the qualification phase all the great moments that we had over the years leading up ah to the world cup and it's of course it it <unk> up
some disappointment of ah not achieving what we set out to do but you know in the end ah an enormous amount of pride
even in the darkness steve
and i'm gonna be honest steve you have endured more than most more than most managers that i have engaged with despite the darkness is that nineteen <unk> world cup is it start a life high point
the nineteen <unk> world cup it isn't just in it wasn't just about those three weeks in france um
it was about probably a period of time that was one of the most dramatic important moments in in u s soccer history
and to have been a part of that um was a great honor and a great privilege
i don't
i don't dismiss my responsibilities at all or my share in the responsibilities
but i think that all of us you know
everybody should share in the responsibility
i think there were factors that that unfortunately didn't give us a very best chance of being successful and that's what has made me angry over the years that's what has made me disappointed over the years
do they haunt you in your dreams
do they haunt me in my dreams yeah it to be honest everyone should know yes
yeah i
um i find myself thinking about those those moments and those days on on many occasions it's it's it it's less frequent now but it was you know ten years
yeah still have

you never quite know whether you're doing the right thing or not at any moment you feel like you might make a mistake that could hurt someone
looking back on twenty twenty that's the new york radio hour from w n y c studios listen where you get your
now twenty years old after the petty grievances the <unk> fantasies the rank embarrassment and the soul crushing future defining big what <unk> of those days i'm pretty much burned are white what remains
for almost everyone i spoke with it's the game of soccer in the u s the fight for respect for legitimacy in belonging both within the united states and externally in the eyes of the world
more than anything nineteen <unk> was supposed to be the year that this group of guys playing this game finally won over the great and carrying american audience to establish the game they loved
soccer long <unk> in the united states is a truly major league sport
and they blew it
we could be mercenary about this and say well they lost you know the commercials they lost the <unk> boxes they did they certainly lost all that but they also lost their pride
e s p n reporter
i mean they were a proud bunch of guys these guys you know it's big country they were the best we had to offer pretty much
and they would terrible and they didn't just lose they lost to iran and they finished last in the tournament ah thirty second out of thirty second
that's not what americans do that's not what we're accustomed to we don't lose like that
and the ramifications for soccer
as we found out you don't need to get these chances every four years and when you get them you have to take advantage ah especially in a culture in which they are not paying attention
the rest of the time the way they are during that month and by going out in ignominious fashion humiliating fashion
i did this is in some ways usually too strong a word to apply to sports but
this was disgraceful fashion ah they heard soccer
so the damage to the profile of the game ah you had people watching
i i put that damage in excess of a billion dollars
it's hank <unk> again
how long did it take you to get over nineteen <unk>
oh i'm not over
i'm not over that was the lowest point of my career
i'm not over
you live with that
what mistakes did i make that affected that game
ah some people may not care as much as i did
but i care ah and we failed and i i don't like the failure even though i know the
and nobody ever said this out loud but i'm gonna i am not until brandi <unk> said it in nineteen <unk> that we have a good feeling about the sport but the boys had blown it
we had really lost a lot of respect from from the world and internally
in nineteen <unk> the u s women's national team they exploded into america's consciousness one year after america's most dismal failure soccer once again was breakfast table conversation across america
because players like brandi <unk> and mia <unk> they were plastered all over all <unk> boxes
so yeah while his dull that the u s men failed to even qualify for the two thousand eighty world cup worry not the u s women will please god once again with
at the two thousand ninety world cup but ultimately it doesn't matter cause america you've got to face it
soccer is here it's in your heart the only truth is i can watch more soccer in the u s than i ever could when i first arrived
remember but then i could only hear a big game in england by having my dad to hold up the phone to his own television back in liverpool
now i can watch the action from dozens of leagues from major to obscure and scream at them at my own television in my own home in new york city
and i'm not allow <unk> thousand people packed a stadium in atlanta this season to set an m l s single game attendance record
i need to set the two previous attendance records atlanta yes atlanta people
the video game mia sports fifa has become more than just the best selling video game it's a tool is introduced a generation of americans to the teams and the stars that play the game
proof <unk> ronaldo and lionel messy they now regularly <unk> in the top ten when americans are asked to name their favorite sports stars <unk> most of their n f l major league baseball and n b a counterparts
soccer is now everywhere in america whether you like it or not your country is a soccer country but few men's national team that still one thing missing
go for it we're americans i can let's climb everest let's go to the moon let's cure cancer
go for it let's win a world cup let's win a world cup

ah we are about to go back to shooting on wednesday we got we got shutdown for a ah covid ah alert
ah somebody popped but very confidential we don't know who but i do believe it was a <unk> but we still have to do the the <unk> day ah <unk> shutdown
so yeah ah i mean it was it was great in a sense so everybody got an extended thanksgiving break but it just sucks because you know everything's put on pause and you know
there's really a system that's put in place when being with what what we're all going through right now with all these new rules and regulations and and this you know
how do you pay people in that break and how does it consider and and so it's a it's a bit of shit show but i'm you know glad everybody is healthy and okay
ah and we are going back to work on wednesday until we get the next <unk>
yeah exactly i
it's kinda what i wanted to talk about because um on this show ah few weeks ago we had mentioned that you guys were back to shooting a lot people were asking us what the protocols and everything ah like that was for shooting now i have seen ah pictures from the set of like
<unk> for example right
yeah
they're currently in in same with the this is us ah they're currently in in glass cubes of emotion where everybody is sealed off on set with some form of <unk>
ah you are kind of ah studying your sides and lines um behind the <unk> and then they're calling in teams one by one and when i say teams ah usually starts with what
ah they do their job and then they move out and then the directors they move out and then you guys go in for blocking ah which is rehearsal and and move out is that is that happening to you guys too because i mean you guys are in action packed show like i just find it so difficult to imagine
it's it's it's it's ah you know at the beginning of the season when when we came back we all fired up to come back and you know you can't there is no hugging there is no nothing there is no like touching it's the weirdest thing and everybody's wearing mask the whole time
ah and we're broken up into you know the reds red team blue team ah and various different other teams that they have and then we come in last when everything's done we rehearse with our masks on
and then when they say action we take off do the scene and put our masks back on and then leave the area then blue team blue ah team comes in and then fix whatever adjustments
um but if you're on red team you're getting tested three times ah a week
ah so monday wednesday friday or or at least <unk> hours before you show up to set ah for filming
um so i'm actually in route right now to ah to go get my testing so maybe while we're doing the show see something being stuck in my nose cause i will do it live
let's do it
hey listen ah so i've got the script where it's basically just me spitting in people's mouth you telling me i can't get that made right now
i mean may be for <unk> or <unk>
people are kink shaming right now
that's one of one of my <unk> is to walk around in public without a fucking mask on
yeah it is
yeah that's how i've i've jerked off in a lot of bars and olds bathrooms i'll say that
so so <unk> <unk> and no mask i mean that is you're you're you're on to something
just a light touch of electricity
yeah i looked <unk> got some <unk> rings
he does yeah but he got studs of loads through there
yeah it it appears to be studs in that rings which i guess is another kink right
and i don't know
cuomo cuomo the the the governor of new york
you saw that
yeah you never saw that picture
no are you fucking kidding me
i'll text it to you hang on a sec
oh that explains all
a lot right
yeah
yeah
a lot he was he was wearing a white shirt kinda look like a polo ah which is not conducive for <unk> ring and you know um i he does what he does
um and and obviously we we don't kink shame like we just said on on the show but it's it's weird to see a <unk> year old man with <unk> rings yeah yeah it is
now i wonder if it's ah that was a decision he made or if some of a woman talked him into and if so what's up with a woman that wants to see a <unk> year old with with <unk> studs you know
yeah
or or may maybe he just lost a bet
we've we've all lost bets and had do fucked up shit over the years that's for sure
i ah a a hundred percent
and ah a portion i can't talk about it on this
no it's fine look it's it's an offer stuff you are on a family show we're we're not gonna drag you down into our <unk> ah holocaust world that we talk about all time on the show not gonna do that with
that's all we are doing is trying to honor her ah like
i appreciate it
ah you know
yep in a christmas spirit
obviously when's the last time you read a copy of anne frank when was the last time you picked that up
it's
what we do is we ask that question all the time to make our guest super uncomfortable like ah shit what's the right answer though do you say oh man <unk> it up like two months ago or or you know or i didn't frank it still like seventh grade
oh jesus
ah ah you you got me
yeah yeah and and again you are on a family show so we we'll move on from it but speaking of of being on a family show i know c b s made the decision to cut back your episode order due to covid
um and they did they did the shows on the network um yeah well how many how many episodes you guys doing this year
ah we are only doing fourteen but if you include the two hour premier which is two episodes that we didn't air last year cause like the season ended on such like a a weird note was like
season finale but a lot of people you know didn't understand did not understand still the covid impact yet that we had shut down so we couldn't finish filming and so the season ended
but i can tell you this that the season <unk> yeah the studio or network or t v is is pretty damn good and really proud of it but yeah we we are shooting fourteen as opposed to ah twenty-two episodes
got you ah um with the recent shutdown did that knock a couple episodes off that schedule like is it like is it like the
football is it that they were doing were like hey man if you guys miss too bad tough shit um and then if that is the case do they dock you and pay you and do you get pay for what you sign on for <unk>
no we get we all every everybody on the crew and everybody took like um we almost lost half in pay
no
yeah bit yeah we sort of just you know that's that's yeah that's the part that sucks we have a contract that says twenty-two but you know this is called like within the within the language of c b s this thing called force measured and so it's
god yeah so they this is this is an act of god if you want to say that or somebody creating in a lab
it is it's a same thing with ah with ah terrorism or anything like that is
yeah
it's hard to get ensured
yeah so they ah yeah they do that and every body just that ah you know suck it up and deal with it and again i always
the amount of thanks that i have here and i mean this sincerely that i have for this job and and get to go do this job and its its by far the
the greatest acting gig i've ever had in my life and it's so much fun so to have lost the job because of covid and not come back which almost happened completely because we're a very expensive show
ah <unk>
we're a big show and
you know c b s lost a lot of money um due to like the n c double a and all sorts of stuff and you know they just they just didn't know how to how we are gonna deal with one of the benefits for us we shoot outside a lot
yeah you guys have a dope ass ah outdoor set yeah
yeah and then um ah and then our our our show runner um spencer and chris um <unk> ah really ah
<unk> put our heads together and look this is how we can adapt and overcome and and we can create more
stories this way and um cause there was a huge budget cut too there like you guys can come back but you can only do this show for this amount which like was was basically next to impossible for like it might being so much half of the budget that we lost
as well
yeah
ah and
you know this this the season we've gotten more into like the the character stuff where you know what what's going behind ah ah you know mostly what these guys are supposed to you know these big action sequences
which i don't believe we could have really done in season one two maybe three but it's you're able to do that so i think every second or third episode there will be like a big action sequence of it'll be little ones here and there but will have these big sort of blow out
um and i just being able to go deeper into the psychology of of of the of the guys and the families and and what sort of happening um behind closed doors
um and and i and i do think that for what the hand that the the the writers had been dealt um and sort of the unknown space that we're now working in
ah i i think that they they'd really held it together sea mosses and and was actually shooting sea mosses episode ah you guy know mark right
yeah yeah yeah
yeah ah and he is one of my favorite writers on the on the show um that's just cause he wrote the submarine episode but just i just think he's you know he is he knows the world
than anybody
that was a tough one for you i mean did you ah how long you were actually in that tube
ah oh first of all
i know you actually <unk> or was that
yes no no i i oh oh well there's like
sense some real panic in that scene that's why i'm asking
yeah well i'm not <unk> in the center but i'm like i'm in an elevator
right
but if i'm if i'm stuck at a tube in water showing up i'm fucking <unk>
you think you think like you're gonna you're okay until like it's happening and like we did this one
ah first of all the the <unk> thing i'd say
and i was like look to the to the stunt team i was like make the water cold because i i wanna i don't wanna be comfortable in there like i wanted to really feel like the thing and and the guy was like are you sure you're gonna be in for a while i'm like it's fine i'll be okay
yeah that was a mistake
what a a terrible mistake
it was like the first and second take i'm fucking delivering by the fourth take my nuts are fucking shown on camera to my mouth and like i'm so fucking cold ah and um
we ah but yeah we still lose one time ah and <unk> you guys know <unk>
yeah we know
so <unk> was
on that episode because he's done so many ah
this time with wesley there the whole time really helped me understand a lot of different beats on there um along with mark
and ah ah ah
you you're breaking up a little bit a j where you at right now
there was one time when we
ah can you hear me
yeah
yeah ah
yeah where you're at now was
i gotta pull up i'll pull up it's terrible just hold on one second one second
yeah where are you are you just driving through the town right now just enjoying like a a nice monday afternoon
he's driving to get a covid test
oh no
so they can start fucking production again
wow that's crazy man see are you getting the swab up the nose is that where you're driving to right now
yeah yeah that's if if if that's what you are saying it if we are ah can you hear me now
yeah yeah i can hear you now yeah you're good
and ah i'm literally gonna pull over ah just so we can if this is breaking up or so you can just hear me okay just one second i'll pull over here
sure yeah
just let me know when it's totally clear and i will ah
perfect right there um but yeah if you if you getting <unk> up today no wonder you look a little nervous
yeah there's
that test is no joke
their fucking brain pierced or some shit like that
i've got nose bleeds from it
well i've got nose bleeds from doing cocaine all the time but that's not the same thing yeah
ah this is definitely not the same thing
i mean it's the same result <unk>
obviously obviously i'm like you know
like at the end of the date greg <unk> used to tell great joke about the years i spent from two thousand five until two thousand eight spending all my money on drugs and prostitutes
um <unk>
and ever then the housing market crashed and then all my friends they did the right thing they're also broke to him like look i had a lot more fun than you do
yeah
and yeah we we ended up in the same spot so there'd be lesson kids is to ah not be responsible
yeah great great community one of the best inter communities of all time
<unk> he um die in o d
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
so don't do that part
is that is that is that better for you guys
yeah yeah you're perfect right there um you're perfect right there is isn't isn't your wife like ah first responder
yeah she is ah she is a nurse she she worked in ah infectious disease for ah ten or eleven years
oh shit
cedars and um ah she got that she got she got out of that when we had our right when we had our and our expecting twins
um ah because just ah just what she had to deal with it um daily in becoming friends with you know patients and and then it it you know what what nurses deal with on
how close they all get with their patients and when they pass it's really sort of hard on them
so ah and she was definitely it mean it was affecting her um and it happened to be there for three kids and and it just emotionally ah she ah by by
a good sit down i was like look there is other things we can do in the same field and she then fell in love with ah like <unk> so <unk> and lasers and all that <unk> stuff we had a friend that was at a clinic and she went over there
now she is that's what she does
that's awesome man do you ever sit down and talk to her about this this covid shit and just be like hey man this had to been built in a lab somewhere like it it it doesn't make any sense at this point
it's yeah it's it's hard and like there's there's two sides it's like they're some some big
infectious people that we have ah relationships with that that aren't at pathology side and that sit on boards and stuff
and what they have said when they've had to report which is is a little <unk> is that any good news that they've told were positive stuff that they are
you are beating others could numbers
which is is never reported
yeah
there is never they're never talking about the good side of things and you know the success of what'd you know and
are you in a referring to the <unk> point ninety percent of people who recover from this
yeah exactly and that's and that's the whole like i i have like personal friends who you know are on the verge of losing like absolutely everything
and um like their restaurants and businesses and like <unk> ah um
ah like they're they're they're so screwed and it's it's so <unk> in the sense that the the decision-making in our state with gavin newsom
who you know it i believe i he's humble he's just
the guy is such a contradiction and such a a piece of shit of what he has how he says you know we're in this together with that stupid smile on his face
yeah yeah
and and i have and i have friends of mine who are barely holding on and have kids and if they would've get this they they have that <unk> point <unk> percent survival
but by shutting down their their restaurant again they have a hundred percent chance of losing everything
right
a hundred percent chance of their kids being affected and their kids kids being affected by this because you know and there is just no there's no help
they're like hey go in and and ah go in another lockdown um but your your mortgage is still due your payments for all your restaurants are still due everything else is a hundred percent due but you gotta go inside and help humanity
but while you help humanity we're gonna fuck you it's like i like if if they were like look taxes everything else is take it we're putting on pause and there's no ah ah you know we're shut down for five months
we're doing this to save humanity
yeah like ah fifteen days
flattened the curve
the longest fifteen days of my goddamn life
it's just conditioning you and grooming you for hey man that fifteen days is gonna turn into thirty that <unk> gonna turn into forty-five and then it's gonna turn into three months and then six ah all their businesses will shut down um
hey but you still gotta pay your taxes yeah
ah and and everybody that's telling us to fucking stay inside they are still getting paid money they still getting paid shit ton of fucking money
yeah
i mean newsom newsom he between the him meeting at the french laundry place where he's telling everybody to wear a mask him ah ah telling his ah kids
or telling that kids can't go to school but he sends his kids off to like montana or something to go to school ah and then but during the shutdown his <unk> was the only <unk> that was allowed to stay open
right
so just it's just like i i'm sorry how the fuck is this guy if there is just knowing the people in power are ah and there's too many of them in that do as we save it
we do ah um and they they are all getting paid a shit ton of money and we're all told to sit back and and fucking take it and if you don't you are you're shamed you are made a fool of and we have this other side of social media like
you gotta do what <unk> <unk> and it <unk> me off too as like i wish more people would spend less time just reading headlines and more time actually just going to like
like the c b c or actually reading facts and just and educating yourself on there realizing
that go to where the science is and not where the narrative is that needs to be pushed and maybe you'll get
this is not saying
you you democrat or republican you just be an american and do your research and stop being a sheep and and just hearing what one thing and or just repeating what your friends are or just start shaming people because
you feel that that's what it is you need to do it it just it's gotten to the point now especially here in l a where everybody is you know the cancel culture and everybody's so fucking righteous about what they know
but then when you ask them about just basic things they're
they they can't answer because they don't they don't do the research
no one does yeah no one does and then and then even when you you know you think you have the answer like um there was a a first responder like edward edward ten point three million listeners ah eighty percent of them are military first responder right
so i got this text from a first responder that i'd i'd like to read here um because here's here's what we're we're headed for um he works in a major city ah all i'll say is it is top ten in america
ah city wise cause <unk> adams he is a he's a <unk> um so he just got the word last night that ah he'll be able to take the vaccine um as early as up to next week
ah he's a <unk> he says it is the pfizer vaccine he says it will be two shots <unk> apart by two weeks um supposedly this is what they're telling him you're gonna get sick for about two days
ah it's gotta be stored in temperatures of minus a hundred and seven degrees celsius
holy shit
yes it can only be out of that temperature for three hours before going bad ah so they have to get it to you pretty quickly once it's taken like out of the freezer right um now the reason why he broke me this last night is is ah
ah he here's what else he went on to say was that and i said um
ah you know how do you feel about taking this ah cause he's the first responder and what they're trying to do ah allegedly is give this to all the first responders first because obviously they're treating people every single day and they're dealing with covid patients and all that shit they go how do you feel about it and he's like well
for some reason and i'm just reading this for biden here cause he allowed me to um which is for some reason they're gonna keep this pretty hush hush ah the reality is there is no cure he said this he he personally believes
and and this is what ah i wanted to ask you cause your wife has worked in this field he says this is not going to stop <unk> it will always be here it may take up years for us to build the immunity for it that's why there will never be a cure for h i v or the flu
it's a virus they mutate the strain ah that's here in united states is not the same one that is in europe so maybe one day it will be like the other corona viruses which which you know are are basically just like the common cold
ah he says you know as a first responder this is a fucking shit show he's like i've been around this thing for every day since i have been ah working at the very beginning exposed to treating patients with it
ah so for i'm not caught it nor do i have the antibodies and i don't know whether or not i want to take this vaccine because fuck it there's too much unknown about the vaccine that's currently coming out
and him personally as a first responder he's saying this is not enough data that i would trust taking this thing
no there's
definitely not i mean ah this thing was rushed
it take you it take seven years minimum for ah for it to for for any vaccine i mean i personally i've never got a flu shot before i've never i'm not <unk> like my kids have all been vaccinated but i prefer like the flu shot you know i've always
been a believer about like your immune system figure it out yeah there's especially especially when we're in <unk> point <unk> you know my mom she's in in on the other side i think ah she's seventy and that rate she has a
rate so <unk> point something
yeah so um but again it's like do i tell her and then she has some sort of <unk> like we just they haven't there's just no data in this it's you know what's scary is like first they were like hey do your self a favor and and
for the good of society wear a mask please now they're like it's mandated
now it's like hey we got this vaccine hope you guys would take it and what i'm worried is that they're gonna be like they start to you don't take it like with a <unk>
that's exactly where i was going with this what if they say this to you hey man in order to come back and shoot you have gotta take this vaccine
and i've gotta go find another job i gotta you know i gotta join you up on your podcast
yeah it's fine
we're hiring
we have more chairs in here in use
i don't i don't know i i really i don't
there's i unless you get at least two to three years of stuff it's like if i'm <unk>
<unk> point nine six whatever the fuck it is of survival why do i need to do this you know and you know what the common sense thing
you know what my wife and i've talked about this because when she the ward that she worked in during flu season
um which was a coronavirus and if you look on the back of the <unk> bottle right prior to any of this break outbreak
look at the back of <unk> bottle it says kills coronavirus right and so this is you know the flu has been the the strain of this satanic <unk> so you know and during every flu season
they would take their immune compromised ah in the ward and they would
isolate them from they'd limit in out of people coming in to see this ward cause they would fear for that they got that thing they would die kind of like what's happening right now except you were still able to go to ah go to work
you know and the thing that ah ah somebody can prove me wrong on this is
our
death toll in america from two thousand and okay ah two thousand eighteen and two thousand nineteen of are are in total deaths
were still less this year or maybe we could last time could be a little higher or could be even um from the last i think two thousand eighteen was a huge year
our <unk> thousand people died of the flu i think yeah
yeah so but we're still the numbers were not we're not way past what our regular death toll is for the entire country for the year so i'm just it just i i've never seem to get the answer well
why why is that if this is a pandemic we're we're we're exceeding our yearly death rate then why we're nothing but but pandemic usually when you're exceeded
so and it's i just it's there's so many unanswered questions i think everybody that is really questioning it and just looking at numbers is starting to go hold on a second here this doesn't this doesn't make sense
you know and and when someone then can't give you the answer back is supposed to just shut up and and and and you need to verge your signals with us and do what you're told and it's like that's not my just give me the answer so i understand if you can provide the proper thing
and tell me based on fact and science i'm i'll comply but until you can't and and give me the reasons then i i'm not doing it i'm not gonna let my kids do it and i'm not i mean look at the the schools that have been open
there's when were have you heard of any deaths in schools
no no and my kids are in school right now and i've got you know i've got a <unk> and a two year old both of them are in school they're fine ah you know as parents we get these <unk> or text messages ah if something bad happens obviously
um kind of like everything else these days it's you know some app that come comes to your phone or whatever three of my son's teachers have had the coronavirus and i will get this e-mail that says hey the teacher tested positive we've removed the teacher
but the kids have stayed none of the kids have gotten coronavirus um they're fine they've removed the teacher to quarantine for fourteen days and then they come back and ah so far so good is for school ah has has gone but um you know until we
come up with some form of plan ah to to keep everybody working in the economy and kids in school and all this of the shit um man i i don't know what's going to happen because you know ah look at your industry in particular ah with
with hollywood right
you're you're hanging on by a thread as far as the theatrical movies go right now no one will go to the theatres not not only because of a you know you're twenty percent capacity or whatever it is
um the theatres can afford to stay open but also studios have pushed all of their movies ah until at least april or may of next year as far as being released in the theatres so even if they were open there's nothing to put in them
i've i've got a theory
ah i'd love i'd love to hear it
what this is less of a theory and more of like what if so what if
someone who is ah i don't know not a <unk> and not a giant pussy decides to open their own theatre and then that becomes the avenue for watching live shit
but then hollywood has to start <unk> towards audiences that would go which were more conservative audiences
so does hollywood become conservative twenty years from now because the only audience they have left are conservatives who actually show and watch shit now how funny would that fucking be
yeah you know i it is kind of look it's kind of happening in texas right now so dan and i have tickets to go see billboard next weekend right
um i have been to this venue before it holds about two to three thousand people you have to wear a mask to get in once you're in you take off that mask it was a country concert there maybe two months ago right i saw girls there was a table full of girls
next to me about eight of them raging their faces off doing shots dancing on top of tables like no mask no nothing and it was just like what are we doing um you know so i think it depends on where you are and what you do for a living because ah right
now the the other thing that has sold out around here is <unk> movies ah and they're showing old movies and and it's a blast if you've kids and all that stuff
that we just we just went to one ah last it was a premier ah the <unk> and ah the the second <unk> the kids especially great with if you love nick cage i'm the biggest nick cage
everyone nick cage is a national treasure god dammit
no no no pun intended
ah he he like him and ryan reynolds it's fucking brilliant and i highly recommend anybody to go see that movie
ah ah but we went it was our first drive and we took our kids and i gotta tell you it was a blast like we had we'd put the mattress in the back in the <unk> and like pop the thing and they didn't know what they went in kind of have this like <unk>
ah not like red carpet thing but like you <unk> and like they had this all sort of like light tunnel with all the big characters in which it was just it was like the pivot that they made to make that experience for the kids and then we got there
and you know you get your popcorn and stuff that they had a blast you know and it was i enjoyed it like i i'm done the driving through and it was my wife's first driving
oh wow oh wow
ah so that was that was awesome so i mean if they can start doing that sort of stuff like um awesome the theaters can pivot and and do that and still make their money
i think that's a a great thing but did just go back to something you said there about the kids that really concerns me is
these these these people don't understand um or i i don't i don't think so they're putting the thought into we don't know how bad we're re fucking up our kids by by doing this
our kids learn to get and you grow by this being interactive and and playing on the playground and and wrestling and and just being a kid
and there was this opportunity for like when my daughter was in the pod work five families got together and we hired this teacher and one of her friends um had some space in their house so they created like you know classroom
five kids taking the curriculum and just teaching it and they've had it's been the best thing ever for the kids because they're able just to see there and they don't have to wear mask and they have to this and then the school says some days ago like we're gonna allow you back
but everybody has to wear mask all the time they are gonna be six feet apart at all the times if your child falls unfortunately our teachers can't go and pick them up or remove their mask i'm like what the what <unk> <unk>
like you just all these weird rules and am i i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna our kids our my daughter she knows what covid is but it it's such a depressing word for her and like seeing my seeing my boys
you know it term of had to travel we had to wear these masks and then processing like this is no it's just <unk> i i just don't think the though um has been put into what damage we are create what this
this <unk> o c d stuff about we are creating we're an weirdness of people so if they chalk chalk of some people be afraid it's like i would show up i remember picking my daughter up from a a <unk>
and literally a a you have to go back to this play ground where they'd they'd ah ah where they'd be after school this is you know two years ago three years ago and like i walked up and she was literally licking the slide you know and i'm like
what are you doing she said it tastes good daddy i'm like oh my god and then like two days later she had have like a <unk> or cold and she get over it but it's like it's like that what how that's how we grow i'm sure you guys were awkward you know go and play dirty and
there was no hand <unk> and you spill them and you insist them and like they just not consistently hand <unk> what we got to get you got even as adults you have to build up this for the immunity to to do and hiding from
a disease is not gonna if you look at the numbers at <unk>
and colorado right <unk> didn't lockdown in the in the way that colorado did and they have half the numbers of what colorado
yeah but <unk> at this moment they are not allowed to touch each other i don't think
but it's like just like none of the none of that makes sense and and and i think when you leave it to these governors to sort of use it as the sort of power hungry you know
way to control your your there's gonna be a a you know there's already people talk a i afraid a lot of people saying like if the this continues there's there's gonna be a push back and it's gonna be a big one
you know there's so much that you can there was so great about this country and i am an <unk> to this country and what's so great about this country is the that the ability to you need free speech and and and to
to live your life and i think when you start basing mixing politics with medicine it's an slippery slope that we go down and i and i really believe that you are taking away the fundamentals of why
this country is so great you are <unk> people's speech you are um you are putting rules and stuff where if you don't whether if you disagree and don't conform you will be <unk> <unk> and i think that
is a very and and it just <unk> me off that people are not open to hearing when you say this is crazy you know i suppose i just now go now miss phone what i am told it's like
what where where have you all gone like how how is it if you vocal about
ah something that than you are you know you are against it and is suppose to just questioning to understand better so you can give me the proper facts so i can make the best decision base on looking those facts
to ah for my family when you can't provide that so how can i make your decision so therefore when they keep questioning
yeah
and it just an and i think that's the disconnect that people don't understand because just <unk> to facts that don't make sense i don't know how that's a good thing
yeah it's not i mean we're we're turning like you were talking about with the kids we're turning this whole generation into ah tony <unk> and <unk> basically
gonna be great detectives but they're gonna be walking around with hand sanitizer afraid to touch things for the rest of their lives
and
what happens when there is like <unk> and this ah like we've never done this before so is
no it's stupid
we're gonna like we're gonna freak out every time there is a ah flu bug or that there is
yeah
this and like and we're just gonna have that there is i guess there is no there is this does doesn't make sense there is no way in hell anybody in my family is taking that vaccine
i've been strong with my wife she agrees with it and you know if that's if it comes to that then well i think there would be more push back of people that won't where though like you're gonna like have to do this and i think more people are gonna be like well then i am
don't have like with ticket master ticket master can go fuck themselves and nobody will go to the concert
they would go
go do your go make your show somewhere else then because that's the rule they won't if it's last thing we find i guarantee you somebody else will start you know a private ah a private sector of
you know whenever it wheels or think we can fly on on planes and or buses or whatever it is we're just they there'll be cause there is enough people on on the side of question that will that have a if i can enough money to
adapt and pivot to make their own way of entertainment and travel
right
so
we've been on this slippery slope for a number of years now probably twenty-five years where ah political correctness has has robbed of us of our ability to learn how to do conflict resolution particularly the young age
on the face when you're six seven years is a lesson or getting punched in the face
you know what i mean it's not not
physical violence but being able to disagree with one another in public
where everybody's opinion is on the same plane same level right
you're not you can't shame me for for any of this stuff ah and when you try you can you can get fucked frankly
i mean what what other man it it's so easy a very small percentage of the population is is truly susceptible to this how much just to pay them and then pay other people to take care of them and let us all do what the fuck we're doing anyways
that would be a way
cheaper then the fucking seven to eight trillion dollars we're gonna end up spending on this
yeah and and ah back to your thing about the child regression
million
being shutdown permanently
businesses like like the child regression too and education and everything umm like i have a show with my wife called ross patterson revolution tomorrow we're actually doing a serious show about this and like and like cause our children are <unk>
from this like i mean it has
yeah
completely changed ah them and the way that they view the world and like they're going backwards in life
just in learning but like in simple day-to-day things that like people aren't really talking about and ah that's gonna have a long term effect too not only on our you know ah our economy but us as americans
our kids are gonna get fucking <unk> from all of this shit because
so many rules
over forty percent of kids aren't showing up for their zoom classes over forty
of kids are not getting their education right now
yeah
and be and because the parents and it's not the parents fault the parents if their are a single mom or something they've gotta go out and they've got to work to hold onto whatever they got to feed their kids
you know and and then the kids are say here is a zoom thing and the kids are like yeah yup i i'd rather not do that so there's no there is just no support
for the and its an and again i don't how they've thought that it that it was gonna work that you like yeah they've gotta <unk> do these zoom classes but you as a parent have to
still work it it's like who are who are writing these <unk> like i just like literally i am so dumbfounded at some of the stuff that there is just no common sense put into this
and if this is what what it's what's that ah analogy with the frog and the water where if you throw a frog into hot water right away it would jump out but if you put a frog into the water and slowly turn up the heat the frog will die
right
we're into that right now it's like there is a lot like it's like like i said before masks weren't mandated now they're mandated and it just like slow we're slowly like you take with travelling before
you know <unk> ah you had you know you bag no baggage shortages after that it was baggage shortages then the prices slowly upped and they slowly started commit and you just we just keep <unk> ah accepting certain things
and there is no push back you know and then all of a sudden you go on a trip and its an extra three four hundred dollars when you get to the the gate to check in because of the bags
but you know it's the same thing with this we <unk> are just to just adding this and adding this and taking away and taking away and the one thing with government when it takes something away they ain't fucking giving it back that is never coming back
julia <unk> whenever you take power very rarely gets given back to the people and that's a problem that's why america was started in the first we don't like rulers around here we don't like being told what to do
particularly by people who don't live the same type of lives that they we do i mean what does gavin newsom have had to tell me about living my day-to-day life is he gonna tell me about hair gel and teeth <unk> is that what he's gonna teach me about how about you get fucked gavin
i do like his teeth <unk> though
when he said the stuff about honestly like i thought it was a i though it was a joke he said the stuff on the thanksgiving rules about there's no singing or chanting i was like what
you can't pass food from one person to another like come on
alicia <unk> used to baby bird her her kids food i don't know if you remember that but she has to chew the food in her mouth and then spit it into her children's mouth she wouldn't be allowed to do that any more um the share you know like way the kids are older but ah
it is an infamous shot if you pull that up of alicia <unk> baby bird feeding her children
how hungry would you have to be to allow somebody to spit chewed food into your mouth
so it was chicken by the way um so they were they were yeah yeah yeah they were on a train and she is chewing chicken and then spitting it into the child's mouth
now she's she's heard of a <unk> right
ah ah but look you are on a train man you can't always bring a <unk> with you were ever you want to go i know i'd love to personally
that's that's you know poor preparation is what that is
it really is

yeah i'd seen his land a couple of inches just like walking around on his land i mean that's where you know that's that's what i want my kids to do i got two twin i got my twin boys who are just absolute maniacs like i was when i was a kid and ah
except there's two of em and um they're when they get out into nature they're so happy you know when they when they have to do the city life or you know they just they're they're like wild horses i gotta run em
you have to um cause we were looking in ah in nashville oh um previously a few years back and um we enjoyed dan and i do a bunch of events there um we enjoy it but ah
there's something about the hill country of texas that is just like oh man alright this is amazing nashville is kind of spread out where you have to take a bunch of highways but um
yeah
ah the hill country of texas you're kinda on these back roads and you're like man is this real does this exist down here like
ah like if you when you leave austin you're still in texas
ah when you leave nashville you're in tennessee
family then you you kinda know what the <unk> are like and ah in that in that area of the world
i had a great time with last year ah i went out to i did some work with the blue campaign and we went out went out there and um i got a little tour
and we did did did the charity dinner that we did was so it was like in it was in <unk> and it was this gentleman had this ranch that was on it it was like this giant barn and just like ah
drinking and and just like you know it felt like a bunch of irish people texas <unk> and irish people are are ah are are very similar in the in the gatherings of family and and good whiskey
ah so it was ah but we had just i had been out there seeing his land and you know being around a group of people that i was i was like that keeps up the switch for me i i called my wife and i'm like babe this is texas it is just so much fun here
i may know there's a there's a ton of <unk> um are you the one who's got a partner are you with <unk> <unk> in a company
so after ah ah you were on our show last time and and then we started messaging on instagram and all that stuff i saw pictures with <unk> and i didn't know i did a movie with <unk> <unk> back in the day and ah he's a great guy
he was then accepted um
yeah okay so so <unk> and i <unk> is a god father to my twins like we're we're best friends
yes
and
tell us about your company
yeah we started ah like six five six years ago we started um a company called paper clip ah and it's um it's a <unk> bag company we we um when i my wife was
i just had willow i took willow to go see my boys for i took her out for the first time and went to go to my boys at the pink taco on um sunset boulevard and watch some football
and um i went as i pulled up my daughter had like that explosive poop that went up her back and ah um which i still don't know how kids do that where it shoots up there back
and so i am like rushing in and i'm panicking and i'm going to the bathroom there was no changing table and i was just like oh shit where is the changing table and the guy was like yeah we don't have changing tables in men's bathrooms um
and so i go back in and then i forget like the <unk> pad thing that we got at the baby shower so i had to like take my shirt off and like lay it down on this like dirty floor and like changing it at this it was one of these like i failed a moment of father but as i was
julian i was like what if like you had a <unk> bag that like had a <unk> section that was a table and a i had <unk> and i had been hanging out his wife was pregnant and he had called me
this after show this has happened and i was like had a few cocktails and was sketching out on a this like ah napkin and i was like dude there is there's none out there and there's like we didn't want to come up with a bag it was like we we knew that
the moms would still buy it but we wanted it to look where where a dad would carry it because every <unk> it had flower prints and sort of stuff so we flew to china did a bunch of prototypes
and they have gone to this baby show in vegas which is at which is the a b c show it's the biggest baby show in the world for when you get to you know ah shake hands with all the big boss aren't there for me to understand the market and who we are up against
we deliver here the prototype and on the second day we got a blue ribbon ah from ah from the mommy bloggers that was like the biggest award there that was the best innovation
of <unk> seventeen and we are like what like okay guys want him like holy we didn't know what we had but this is great and our patent actually just came through
um about six months which is a really cool thing because i don't know how many time i have
tried to get a patent on something and it's taken so yeah we got a patent on it and then last year because of because of all the sanctions put on china we
oh sorry year and a half ago um we moved our stuff to indonesia and we found this factory that ah makes the best fabric it feels like a two me fabric almost um
and it's all recycled plastic um so we we <unk> to make our entire line ah ah recycled ah ah plastic and with the first <unk> bag in the ah in the world to be recycled plastic and it
each year we won other by peel magazine or some sort of thing ah best <unk> bag out there if we go to ah ah paper clip life dot com i know we are actually having a huge cyber monday
sale today we check it out each one of those the bags names like is named after one of our kids like the willow
is it based on how much they shit and how much room they need
pretty much
like willow takes a big dump so
she she just she dropped a big load ah but but yeah so it's it's honestly it is it's blown up for us ah ah ah i never i've said this before i never thought we be playing a navy seal on t v and selling <unk> bags
on the side um but but you know everyone not not through relationships or anything but everyone from the rock to the <unk> they've independently pick one up or someone's been gifted to it and
so it's been ah it's it's been cool man but to see it sort of explode in the way that it that it has um especially with the road that we've been on and truly i gotta tell you if it wasn't for <unk> and his day-to-day like he
he's running that and his sort of ideas he's i ah ah ah i would say if it wasn't for his focus on that we ah the company would not be where we are today just it's unbelievable what what he's able to
done so to doing you know where we got into <unk> and um couple other ah bigger stores we should be just depending with this covid stuff we should be in in the beginning of the next quarter
so it's kind of exploded on it's it's it's exceeded pre covid we were on track our first sort of you know three months of last year or sorry this year prior covid we
sold more than any of the years prior it was just like it was on a huge sort of bell curve trajectory um and we're still doing it just delays with display but once we get each shipment that we come and they they just sell out
um so
any any thought of going on like shark tank dan and i have had a couple friends on shark tank
we thought about it but they actually they take so much we take an a b c takes a percentage and so we're you know fortunately we're we're doing okay and and the one thing we learnt with this is you know you can have the greatest sort of
sales campaign and and what not but <unk> bags or or baby product in general are sold in the playground if another mom says hey i recommend this then that mom goes out and gets it like instantly
so it's you with just a slow burn with with baby product and word tp mouth and and i can tell you because it's designed by dads and or wives who played a big part in and sort of the design um
everything in our development has been as we've been growing with our kids and we're like well let's do this like how we opened that how we created the bag to open up in front instead of having to reach your hand down we're sort of like the <unk> if you open something up
where falls out in front you can kind of see where everything is where our wives have this jedi power they can stick their hand in this giant purse that's got three hundred things but they can find their <unk> in two seconds here's my <unk> we're supposed to you know man really quick sort of <unk> open you can kind of see where
everything is you like but yeah it's it's been a it's been a ah ah a crazy journey and you know we've almost lost the company due to the china stuff and due to a bunch of other things
but we've managed just to you know pivot and and and and and find a ah way to succeed and it's it's thriving right now so it's great it really
if i can make if i can make one a recommendation put ah ah a camel back bladder in there so dads can put booze in that thing
gotta have a <unk> bag inside of there for the booze
just a slot for box wine to put in there
just just just actually like ah ah a little um what are they called <unk> cord that you can snap on a box wine
look i'm waiting for white claw to make juice boxes or sell a sell a sell a sell a helmet that comes with it
yeah a nice little but nice little beer helmet two full wine bottles
that that that keep going yeah i know <unk> he's doing well i saw him on one of those on bravo he was selling his house on on that thing
he just moved to arizona
oh he did a lot of people are moving there
yeah he moved to arizona which is another place that that we we looked at as well um and yeah he just moved out he got insane like just a gorgeous place for what would have been like five million dollars easy and california he got that for
a quarter of the price
oh yeah easy easily i mean arizona arizona is an interesting state i mean i guess they certified for biden today so it technically is a blue state this year but
you can you can basically fire a machine gun into the side of a mountain there and nobody cares
really
yeah
yeah oh yeah
it's pretty dope
i'm in
they have constitutional <unk> shit there too i believe
really
very interesting state
can i give one other shout out thing before i
go ahead man
ah so um i've been working with ah mike and <unk> <unk> and we launched this ah this
campaign that we're doing there's these this texas ah ah t shirts that um we're we're selling and it's inspired by ah my character on the show sunny
um there's ah two designs um they're really cool and a portion of every t shirt that's sold goes to gary <unk> foundation
and um we're offering um if you buy one of the t shirts and you tag me ah mike sam and forge um on your stories
the we're gonna enter it into a thing and and you can win ah for christmas or whenever ah ah a twenty minute zoom ah a call with me
ah over christmas to have some cocktails and ah shoot the shit so if somebody wants to go out and buy that buy a t shirt once you get it post it i think it's gonna end by like december twenty december fifteenth in december
a twentieth and ah sometime over christmas we can have some cocktails
that's awesome man

they're great they're great group of guys and ah gary <unk> is a really dear buddy of mine he's a mentor i worked with him on c s i new york for nine years but just ah a guy that i become really close to even more so on the show about how to
use my platform and the space and understand how to you know leverage that to raise money um and and sort of what people i should work with because there is unfortunately a lot of shady people out there that
take advantage and the do and the dollars actually don't get to the veterans um but but gary <unk> is you know the real gold standard and and and does so much for ah for everyone so ah i this is a charity that i have actually worked with first hand
um and ah i am really excited to partner with mike and sam forged clothing and and money is gonna go to a very good cause ah ah of helping back to gary <unk> foundation
yeah gary <unk> has done more for veterans than any living american probably
saw an an interesting um they were doing a story on him the other day on t v and they were like you know what's funny about gary <unk> is after it is all said and done and he has left this earth he will be remembered for helping veterans more than him as an actor or anything
and and helping veterans
yes
i would argue i mean dude if you think about ah a guy who's i mean just dedicated his life to helping veterans like it is it is
literally his life and um ah it's been amazing to see and ah i they they weren't wrong i was shit was on a b c the other day and i was like man um
the amount of time and effort in money he's raised is insane they did a half hour special and i i was <unk> i was like
and he and he he does not he is so invested like and i have gone down to the hospitals with him and and just when people when you meet the families there that he's built the houses for and
and he does this stuff without a camera there or it just like he just does this in his you know guys coming home that need those the that have lost a leg and they they need a whole reform of the house and he'll
literally go in there and by the time they're out of the hospital everything is setup and there for them so that they at least have that battle of of adjusting back to life in front of their kids
that there's there's that other assistance there of the simple things in life opening the dishwasher or just getting stuff out of the cupboard and being a part of the family
which i didn't think about before sitting down and talking with gary i'm like oh my god he's like yeah it's a one thing that we can help with it's just that adjustment back in there where he don't feel that extra shame or whatever it is that
they're going through that i can't help or i can't be a part he he takes that that first initial shock at least to to help them adjust in the homes these tech home that he's done are are state of the art
some it sometimes it's a brand new home like he'll just say screw it and and it's you know <unk> thousand square foot house with everything that you could imagine for these guys these men and women and you know i have done some work with him on the with the with the fi the <unk>
families and the kids and he does the <unk> express thing every year with the kids the guy's just is the best person um in this space and just a great guy someone i really care about and

blake <unk>
from your search history that's revealing about who you are
thank you for using my god's given name
your your confirmation name blake <unk> of course
i'm gonna go with ah can you get poison ivy from dead leaves is ah the most the most recent search that i had
what's the answer to that
stay tuned no i would have that with my idea for a tease guys listen i don't want to do your job for you but they will hang around
oh that's a text
there's anything i do is test the patience of those
that's rather starbucks screenwriter crown
okay so what happened you see saw a pile of leaves and knowing you i know you like to do you always you can't resist jumping into a dead pile of leaves it's your naked body so what happened
let's just say i went out wearing nothing but a rake and i saw a pile of dead leaves and um so i was wondering cuz like i picked them up
and cuz i was moving the matter my way i'm like oh that looks like poison ivy and apparently five days after poison ivy is dead it's still has it's the oil on poison
and the oil is still on a threat during that time period i was fine you know
i'm sorry i have
i made a joke and then you said something that actually struck me as even more odd is that you had to move them out of your way what are you talking what what was what do you talk you were
a leaf pile or some shit you'd like to get back leaf pile fuck coming play what
what it was the eminent domain actually had invoked eminent domain ah they were evident in my domains so i move them no i have as you know i've been into a par three golf recently in most feel as and it was in the way of my ball
and i moved them out of the way with my hands and didn't make a difference cuz i don't know how to play golf yeah but ah that those leaves are gone and they were dead dead as a <unk>
had of ever had a poison <unk> ivy experience ever as john <unk> no yeah i never had that either
never got that never never been stung by a bee lived a very shelter
what's interesting
never been stung
never been stung the new
ah from the people write u b movie ah
i watch that movie for the first time last week he was like genuinely more horny than i was prepared for it to be
yeah jerry <unk> b falls in love with renee <unk> wine mom like
and she clearly for me it was very clear that she only views this as a friendship with jerry seinfeld b but
she is like clearly need someone in her life and so she says like oh yeah i'll hang out oh yeah i'll hang out
but then jerry seinfeld b kind of
you know it's a tale is all this time
getting friends zoned big time he doesn't even realize
and i think the most tragic part about bees is that their bodies have a horizontal stripes instead of vertical stripes with those big fat <unk> they have and if they got a little bit of a swimming action with those those stripes are doing
<unk> aren't very <unk> you know got it is what it is it is what it is
all right <unk> what is something from your search history
something from my search history i am actually going to look at the things that i prepared ah oh okay so search history black wellness holiday guide
my cousin ah teaches yoga his black which like there's very few black yoga instructor so shout out to black my yoga but um he got me on this whole thing of like
i need to find small businesses to send my christmas gifts from and i would prefer them to be black on so now i'm like on a full hand to find like black owned businesses that i can send gifts from
how's the how's the hunt going and you do have without ah giving anything away do you have you had success well what are we looking at for christmas gifts
we're finding some cute places we are finding some <unk> we are finding some <unk> the issue is that amazon gets things to the girls in two days
you know just base as murder and as they go have your gifts on time
so i'm like okay i think like with smaller businesses especially during a pandemic especially when the u s p s as you know been so severely damaged by the <unk> i'm like okay how far ahead do i need to order
right now
yeah so that's
i'm like oh panic cuz i need to order like forty gifts now so um
yeah that's the only issue but it's still going good but i'm trying to buy small i hope people are buying small this year especially kids god damn this is the hard year for small businesses
oh yeah i think that the year did the thing with amazon too is half the time if you just figure out what the product is just go to the website of the product the manufacture and chances are they're already having some kind of deal
you want some just get it from the brand you know there's a way around and you know what maybe have to wait three days four days remember that remember the days used to wait weeks
for our <unk> orders to arrive
come on dealers
come on now
what it what it cody <unk> i know you all know him he um he tweeted me a couple days ago and was like and i just remember going to my <unk> at least at three different facebook accounts and i did with three different photos i still do
and then i think i might have four now but the reason was cause i was shopping at toby and <unk> they be like fifty percent off if you give us your facebook
so i put on my ski mask and was like
lay say
lay say this is lay say you may lays
i feel like ah based on the ah as i keep reminding our listeners is i'm watching the crown four five six episodes in
and i think the way that we're gonna get out of this amazon thing is a amazon truck needs to hit and kill somebody ah who the president or
ah because that's that's only way london got out of their ah deadly fog was because like some pretty young girl who worked for winston churchill a spoiler alert got
you know that was made up right that was one of the few things that was made up
that's episode that almost made me give up on the show but
yeah the they do a lot of stuff to make winston churchill i'm like the conservatives seem
okay ah i'm i'm not totally feel him at the politics of of the crown i am back on board for watching it but the politics are bad
what we're thrilled to be joined dinner thirty by the hilarious the talented alison stevenson

i was here for fun
some stuff rearranged
what if my heart was like

what do you think <unk> no i had to get my <unk> removed
oh shit
yep yep it's ah and i i did the like even in your description of i went to the e r and they were like no you're good go home which is like
you know i've unfortunate had friends have told that to them and the shit went horribly south when i went home and i'm just so glad that despite that happening and you going back another doctor like okay we gotta get your <unk> out
that you're okay thank the lord thank my lord
yeah i find that a <unk> removal is rarely an elective surgery to usually ah things are going bad at that point
well we all know i have to lose weight i was like why if i just lose like four ounces
the <unk> beside me as do you can you ask for your extracted biological organs after the
why oh fuck you
i know right
i you know i i don't want to get into the <unk> but i imagine you know that they're going to charge insurance whoever whoever do you know if you are that whoever's putting the bill that's a lot of money that should come with the free trash part that comes with it
i should be able to get my <unk> than you are some shit
would you save it though i mean i know we asked those questions and even if they said yeah you want it you like no i'm just i'm

and we're back let's talk about um some ideas for police reform that are being put forward ah in california there's a bill being <unk> ah that is a kind of incremental lists
um in the way that basically all of the ideas for police reform that are endorsed by um the police are attached to be but ah yeah this one
is basically saying that becoming a cop should require you to have a bachelors degree
and be twenty-five years old just based on statistics about what police officers with those attributes how violent they are nurses otherwise
yeah the legislator who's put newt knows who wrote the bill ah is referring to like this study in <unk> that that basically says that ah college educated officers typically typically
typically use less force often and fewer complaints filed against them
now okay that's a good thing to identify that group of people ah but this is you know like we're saying this is incremental change when we know what the real issues are
ah but you know this isn't the issue here and like the reason this bill is coming out isn't because we have a problem with you know not enough cops who studied abroad in <unk>
we have a fucking real issues here this is an issue within policing that is anti black anti poor anti buck and everything ah and they are protected by powerful unions
ah that can keep any kind of real meaningful like legal repercussions from ever you know getting close to them as well as like the financial consequences
ah via these like ridiculous retirement plans a lot of these people have words like dude you get fired and then you're fucking set like no matter what even if you try to murder somebody twice
ah and this is just you know these are the kinds of things that you'd wish the legislators were actually looking at because this is a good way of a legislator being like
well this is an this is an improvement yes that would be great because right now you just need to be i think like eighteen or have a equipped like eighteen with an equivalent in a high school diploma to begin your training
and it can be i think twenty if you're in the california highway patrol but yes this is that a good way to try and weed out other people but it's not really a <unk> attempt at real reform
and we just need to look at how much money is going to these departments and actually just having this conversation about <unk> in communities because the perception in law enforcement in this country is
well people commit crime because they're black ah rather than seeing the full picture of how black and brown americans have been abandoned and were merely just branding this failure of governance as crime
you know it's not always crime it's now we failed these people they have no recourse they are so desperate that they commit crime people commit crimes out of desperation
you know night times out and our sergeant would just do for the <unk> but let's be real like a lot of this is about survival and you deal drugs cause you get a kick out of dealing drugs you do cause that's only employment available to you
that has the kind of income that you're looking for unfortunately or things other things like that gang don't want to be in gangs like this is all these are all you know fact these are by products of this failure
um and <unk> went also point out that this study that the legislator ah is using to say like on yeah look check this out of like you know people who have been to france in college you know ah murder less
ah it was done by the national police foundation which i just wanna point out that they love community policing like solutions and they love putting forward the broken window policing strategy
which is totally fucked up and completely wrong and backwards and biased or so it's already like you know it's what we have an imperfect thing drawing from an imperfect place trying to
you know be presented as you no meaningful change ah so it is i think just i will we will continue to see things like this that look good and are good but i think our avoiding what all the <unk> were from the public over the last year
over what is necessary to change the relationship between the community and law enforcement
yeah
yeah i mean i get up i grew up in in the city of chicago ah which is chicago public schools a very diverse schools and all that and i i i can't tell you enough i mean
there are people who i have met and who i have know a little and they're like oh you becoming a cop and my head i'm like who let you become a cop
they're they're allowing
i'm like i'm like what and so i don't there it's like there's so much about character and personality that matters i think with becoming a cop that i don't know what kind of thing you can create
figure that out of how you get the best character and personality to become a cop because it's it's it's it's a humanity job is dealing with people
empathy for people like you need to have empathy for people you need to walk to work for people
i think even to your point about like the character that of you know of the kinds of officers that need to be out there on the street it is i think you start that by just having like reinforcing the fucking rules
ah so the <unk> who don't act with humanity in mind are quickly just booted the fuck
known to be was like y'all y'all this isn't the place like if you wanna fuck around and do that go to florida or whatever fuck another you know police department but i think for police department as whole idea like
well couple of bad apples or whatever sect with a tossed out all the fucking bad apples then
and then see what you left with and then figure out what the real problem is but they're like there's no even sort of the energy for that isn't even there so we get all these sort of like half measures that
have the like on paper our police reforms but the we are we are well and we are way past the time for these small things like those things hundred sixty years ago ah if you want like start that little incremental process but
now we're looking at the situation and we need you know we need to <unk>
a a a hundred percent a hundred percent
yeah i mean the more you know about history like that that seems to be something that
like the like it's not just that black communities are abandoned its that they're actively imprisoned through red lining and communities
where the you know official government policy is to deprive them of resources and then they're only interaction with the state like that
ten year old who's riding by on his bike his only interaction with the state is violent racist police like it's it's not a problem that can be addressed through incremental change
what's something from your search history that revealing about who you are
i recently google if ah <unk> can chew on palo santo
like for them and it's is it safe for them
that is almost like silver lake google thing i've ever heard in my life i think if you don't know a palo santo is like if you've ever if wherever you are in the current you have some crunchy friends you're like seemingly just lighting a shard of wood on fire and
the vibe in here is so great ah super producer nick <unk> famously kept his control room just so just piping with ah the palo santo smoke so
is it safe though
there's negative energy it said sage apparently palo santo is cancelled though is what i've heard
palo santo is cancelled
i think like why people like myself who are like can i answer you on it
don't let them have it taking it back no
pretty damn good i think it's smells
for an over sage for sure
okay
yeah
yeah any like place they're selling crystals is like who truly like who truly gave way to sage which gave which gave way to palo santo right now
you know go to your local crystal shop if you don't know that's the price my palo santo in there
okay
i will do that the second or that it i'm gonna make a b line for that the second this ah lockdown is lifted
are like musicians especially love thing that's why nick had it do because i've never been like with
musicians who if you are playing with them or in a session or like a rehearsal where there just like let me just get a <unk> a little bit
that's why i it's such a silver lake thing in my mind because like so many rehearsal space is just smell like weed like ah <unk> and you know palo santo
alison how are you ah enjoying your palo santo are you like lighting a is just like a stick that light always
is literally it's like do i have it on me no it's literally just like a stick
yeah
yeah it's the most uninteresting thing to see
really good clears negative negative energy and fearing that staffed but i have a pet <unk> and he needed a new chew toy and i was like
i'm you know post recovery surgery mode i'm like while i have palo santo like
that leave me alone
yeah like and you summon the entertain yourself with but i ultimately decided not to even i couldn't find a straight answer on palo santo specifically it seemed like it might be too risky of a wood for a <unk>
would you pay the two
i ended up just waiting and i ended up just waiting and asked my sister to go to <unk> for me and she got
there you go
pencil shaped wood chew things
should have experimented with the palo santo may it may be will change the whole vibe of the <unk>
so <unk> chew toys just just wood is that kind of the
<unk> forever so don't get me started but if they are very sneaky fragile creatures and i don't understand why we sell them like until five year olds like that should be not okay
they're actually very high payment animals and even like the titled what they chew is important cause someone is poisonous to them neither what isn't
is bad for them something like that i think he'll gone some and not on others are like some like poisoned i don't know basically so yeah matters what kind of wood did they chew
for the record you know an ounce and is on her <unk> keyboard right now
finally i want to talk about a story that would have i don't know it's it seems like it's way too important to cover in three minutes which we're gonna try and do but
the former head of israel's ah what what's his official title
these there's no
he's not some guy with a cool twitter handle of that you know <unk> net yahoo like fox with it's like you know his his heavy use running from the eighties till like <unk> or something
took for a context he's saying if i had come up with what i'm saying today five years ago i will get what he sang i would have been hospitalized wherever i've gone with this in academia they've said the man has lost his mind today
they're already talking differently i have nothing to lose i've received my degrees and an awards i'm respecting universities abroad where the trend is also changing that trend he says that
ah we have made alien contact the u s government and israel in particular ah that we are in communication and in fact in a legal contract ah with the extra <unk> um
i mean i'm glad of that one of his quotes his i'm glad that though the aliens respect contract law
he said quote there's an agreement between the u s government and the aliens they signed a contract with us to do experiments here
they too are researching and trying to understand the whole fabric of the universe and they want us as helpers
i i just the signed the contract this where goes a little too far i know i was on board agreement maybe
you know contract were they were they red lining did they get the lawyers involved are those are the alien the only legal counsel they're like sorry this and this is actually a poison pill in this deal
we will no do it if it's in it's contained in the contract language i don't um but they're saying one of the first <unk> of cooperation is a base on mars where by the way
ah astronauts have already set foot american astronauts and the <unk> underground that's why i can see
i love i love aliens i love aliens my uncle has a ten thousand dollar telescope in new hampshire and he was shown me jupiter up clothes i've i've said this before i'll say it again if i have a family of six kids
i need to be there for my family and aliens come to me and say hey we'll take you with us you can never come back here see anybody again but you will get to see the galaxy for what it is i'd be like let's go
i would go okay i want <unk> that but i will say this guy lost me when he plugged his book
it's like you don't want this guy's book though you know even if like a thing if like if he was talking that real shit he's like you know it's so complex like to say i use the word agreement would completely betray the forms of communication these life forms use
i would be like well okay but when you're treating it like a fucking like just be you know a funny comedy film where they were like hey let's <unk> on some research graham
and then even like his his explanation is like what what where you all been where the aliens been what's going on
he mentioned trump in there too
yeah he did say that ah trump was on the verge of revealing of this but aliens in the galactic federation thing is literally a term from star trek but maybe not
ah aliens in the galactic federation are saying wait let everyone calm down first they they don't want to start mass hysteria they want to first make a scene and understanding
so here's why i like obviously i want to believe and i'm going to ah always error on the side of the others could be possible the thing about the contract
so when my theories on aliens is that they might end up being a lot more similar to us then we expect them to be because of parallel evolution
in the fact that like when you look in australia at like the wildlife that evolved there and it like looks almost identical to wildlife that evolved independently in the u s it's like
there when you have the conditions of life in two different seemingly different places like they do end up <unk> similarly
so i don't know like maybe maybe that is something that eventually always comes up and when there's a civilization that has evolved to a certain point maybe they're like we yet have contracts man
other one then nothing separates us from the single <unk> organisms please that hadn't come all this way to not have the legal paperwork
but i also just like picturing the process of getting from respected in academic circles has this hugely powerful ah career and now
what makes like just selling books just be i'm like yeah they can just seems i don't know i have i have a hard time
imagining that ah evolution like unless he was always all along like had some suspicion that there was alien contact like
he just keeps his mouth shut cause he's gonna do his job all the time you'll like dude you gotta knock that shit off
and he's just using like the same shit the u f o heads and the u s
don't you say i'm <unk> though dog look at this viral video
what about that beam of light above tel aviv that your shot up in the sky what was that guy from multiple angles like that was <unk> we already talked about this doctor
i wonder if two like yeah at a certain point you know this is like is like breaking bad like kind of thing was like fuck it i got nothing
and get a book deal and get my little check so i can you know just buy my retirement cabin and then live life comfortably cause my government pension is running out so i got to exploit that position did say some wild alien shit
i don't know that would be a smart move though because instantly right like it's a it's this has been a global headlines because of because of the position he held so it's like
just if so if you just have that former title to give you any authority keep in mind anybody in any position with authority you can do this
come out with some outlandish ship that would just be like up and the general accepted knowledge of your industry and be like what the former head of what's said what put this ah and then people will laugh you out but you get your little shine
yeah so you're you're officially honor the skies ah <unk> or just trying to sell books shit now
i love the i love the energy of someone who's gonna like completely change the game on us like this and be like no you're not listening they have signed the fucking contract okay and trump almost plucked it all up
and then the aliens were like not found just dead dead for a second because the people are not ready for us to do our grand reveal so if you could just sit on that we would appreciate that and donald trump was like bad
and you know that's basically would our president is he respects the you know agency of
it's like it's also tough that too because we're we're we're like having this conversation is society right now about believing the scientists
like these guys and academic super respected he ran their space programs so this is somebody who we should
buy into right what we should say like guys
well i need like for some like this is i go you need i need you to bring a few friends with you the ratios are good here
i need better ratio i need like five other people who like y'all can actually be like yo yo okay we're we're not gonna tell you about that one mission look into that and then i would be like oh oh oh oh
if the aliens are out there trying to get us to be more reasonable you know i'm just say where did this vaccine come from is all the sudden we got a vaccine is ninety percent accurate or effective come on dude you think aliens didn't give that to us
what the fuck do you think i was talking about what i said operation warp speed
i was doing deals in fucking said belong three six nine dashed c
there is no way he be able the ah not brag about that
actually <unk> this deal oh my god
guys he's gonna do we've heard about his negotiating tactics that he's a bee and there's a nice to meet you alien people i'm surprisingly you come in this negotiation but i just want a job as fuck you and he walks out
ah shit alright let's take a quick break and we'll be right back
we'd like to give thanks to the nurses america relies on at verizon helping nurses connect with their families is the least we can do as why we're giving more to those who give the most
nurses and their families get our best pricing ever on unlimited with five g included at no extra cost five g nationwide included on all unlimited plants
five g ultra why band included on select unlimited plans five g ultra <unk> available only in parts of select cities five g nationwide available in eighteen hundred plus cities
because the people we rely on deserve a network they could rely on that's verizon
the landing the <unk> in a clear jar that you've seen around at some times the name escapes your tongue you know the one with five layers in a jar like vanilla fudge cookies for <unk> like chocolate cherry
<unk> that clear jar bats talented as introducing me smooth creamy <unk> when john made with real ingredients source from around the world made the traditional way
but duchess no indulgent absolutely delighted raised the jar
and we're back i just wanna check in with one of my old bosses gordon <unk> um because he is
he is taking his talents um an burger restaurant to a new location inside <unk> in london and what's on the menu a hundred and six dollar burger
from our point of view in the united states seems like absolutely ridiculous i know in the u k do things aren't that great and last i checked <unk> is not open so i don't know when you are going to even go into this restaurant to eat this burger
ah but this to let you know how you get to a hundred and six dollars a hundred six dollars the extravagant party is a <unk> burger apparently featuring apparently okay interesting
wait hold on this is a scam
a hundred dollar burger
this shit needs to be <unk> this it's this undeniably there has to be this hundred percent u k heritage beef <unk> seared <unk> <unk> fresh black <unk> and <unk> <unk> cheese
that i can see the like forty dollars
i don't know why they even why even put a press release out it's gonna anger people like you want to talk about your luxury burger in the time of like the global depression um but
he did read the room on the other side because he's entering the <unk> game also ah and it's called me wait for health <unk>
i mean and the <unk> <unk> game is getting crowded i'll tell you that is getting crowded
at this point you need a good name you know it is coming down to it cause they'll cost about the same they all basically tastes like shit ah so it's really coming down to a name game for me what's the deal with health <unk>
oh wow the website that it apparently like you know they're doing apparently ah that
that kid and that mean the kid said apparently all on the ah and apparently well you know put some down and apparently that just like okay i just learned a new word also um
the website that's like doing the press release says that <unk> quote discerning palate is behind the <unk> for <unk> bold flavors
there all inspired by the popular menu items from his health kitchen restaurant i'm like so what beef wellington lobster <unk>
i i worked on the health kitchen shows so i know what else we talk about is it t the ah i i i mean beef wellington <unk> sounds like it's worth a punt
and i hear the ingredients by the way are <unk> natural flavors and hate
the his like his cheesy ass like you know puff promo talk is amazing to quote this is gordon <unk> quote
yes even i enjoy a hard <unk> after a long day so i decided to toss the devil horns into the ring and heat things up health kitchen will never freeze over but a cold health <unk> is a great start
did you hear what he said jamie he said yes even i his acknowledging that it would be strange this is real he said even he would after a hard long a long day he's in a <unk> with a <unk>
that's great
yeah beef wellington <unk> <unk> you'll you'll be like i think we need to speak with them are they okay they're drinking beef flavored alcohol
it's <unk> percent alcohol
were also with the sell to you that you gotta it all in all of it is like low though and it hurts you but somehow my thing with <unk> is like
you drink wine the alcohol content is very low but and yet you're still like getting hung over in real time and you're like how is this <unk> i'm not drunk and yet i'm already hung over
what's your favorite flavor
i like i do like a mango white cloud
i like the main white <unk> too
i'll i'll play around with little black cherry
is that a weird move is that a weird move
that what i tell her majesty i say you'll give me that mango crazy but boosted boosted
boosted
sending up a little bit what do you think
ah hey her majesty let me get a main crazy but don't trim the claws actually put some put some claw stands to the <unk> that claw her majesty one time for your boy
so he can fall over picking up dog shit in the yard ah that's just an insight into my sunday mornings
um and just ah one last treat i wanna go out on actually is just jamie and i we were talking about what it was like to work at <unk> back in the day
i don't know this is on that we did this but we we worked at <unk> we actually worked at the same time and weren't even friends it's a shame although i didn't i knew of you because everyone was saying she's a comedian i'm like what there's someone funny here get away from there surely
no one taught to me yeah we should have been friends at <unk> no one taught to me
were you in a weird part of the office it was a weird time of the country was there that the company was having a bit of trouble figuring out there taxing identity
the non nude age
ah we got to go to the mansion for like staff party
you got to go i didn't
i got terribly drunk and walked into a glass wall
my sister snuck into ah hugh <unk> house on the valentine's day yeah and met his son and they were just hanging in there
corner
his own that he was the guy that stole my cake when he was on a <unk> i was like the day that i got laid off and my boss was like here's a cake because i got laid off on my birthday and they got me a birthday slash goodbye cake that was really depressing
and then hugh <unk> son rolled in on a <unk> obviously like he had no idea who i was and used to say hey it was a whose birthday is it can i a piece of cake and he throws all the way and then he fell so it's good
taken off with your cake and your health insurance
there so the other the reason i bring it up is because every like six to three to six months
the online store or the <unk> magazine online store would just have a free for all of shit nobody wanted and the staff could go and my pick from the bones of like the online store and get like a t shirt or beer <unk>
or high <unk> sneakers and <unk> case that she so lovingly took um but i just want to say i just point this out because the state department had a holiday party ah on tuesday
or super <unk> event whatever the fuck you want to call it but i just want to point out what the gift bags were at the state department holiday party quote is from the washington post reporting of the state department party
admit the point said is <unk> and meticulously decorated christmas trees children on tuesday night received be best branded swag such as <unk> <unk> and water bottles
from first lady millennia trump's signature anti bullying and wellness initiative the state department has a <unk> of b best merchandise that is often handed out when the first lady travels abroad
in the absence of a second trump term officials need to find a home for the <unk> gear when official said the official said quote it's time to get rid of the <unk>
that just sounds like a <unk> give away you're like this is the worst this is the bad idea
come and get it we got it here
my family's like um asking me if i had any tattoos nose like i change my mind so often i was like i'll be one of those people that get a <unk> like tattoo regretted
and when i said that her boyfriend pulled up his sleeve and he had a big <unk> <unk> and i was like ah yours is great
i mean it's ah the most recognized logo and on earth the most recognized logo on earth so no matter where you go
when someone has an embarrassing tattoo that is also very large there's almost nothing funnier in the world i like ram into my high school boy for this sounds fake but it was real i ran into one of my first high school boyfriend
um a couple years after he had dumped me for the <unk>
sounds like whip lash that movie
sounds like that movie this christmas he loves you for his music career
okay
he left me for for jazz um a bit then i saw him a couple years later and he had a huge tattoo of fog horn <unk> on his <unk>
and he was like my uncle had got it too was a little thing me and my uncle that he had a huge
ah what the fuck you got a fog horn <unk> <unk>

welcome to
kids get a real like badass in the show today
you seem you seem weird <unk> when i said the word badass you don't consider yourself a badass
not at all not at all my eye to my wife doesn't alter that
is ah is here with us today my my wife thinks i'm a fucking idiot so
ah nothing nothing we can do about that
no matter what cool thing we do in this world
it is it is still i came and go and take out the trash they don't forget about that
yeah write a book come home very great
came out last week and pre order reached number one she was like hey we'll we'll we'll go to dinner for it
ah as the sun rises it <unk> on him is the name of it
go to dinner um kids start screaming and ah she's like can you you take them home
you grab when you grab them and take them up so she could stay with the other one and in drink and i was like yeah yeah yeah no worries no worries now i just go home and
ah what what exactly is your expectation
ah such the celebration
success means that you don't have responsibilities anymore
yes for one day one day
<unk> would not like that
one day you you are suppose to celebrate for one day i believe
like when you finish your book you've got a new book out called the talent war um when you finish your new book what was the celebration because these things are so goddamn hard to write
i can't express it enough for people like i wanna write a book and i'm i'm always like don't don't do it it is so hard man
if it was the first time i put the <unk> down and picked up a ah actual pen out but i would rather go back to warn other ten times
it's crazy right
insane
um so tell i'm already the process and what what made you want to write this book it's called the talent war
um you you got a co author here george <unk> um and and josh cotton as well you put the p h d on them
we of course you have to have the doctor just as justice you know make it official sooner we you know george was a army veteran ah <unk> back in the eighties nineties he's been in town acquisition for twenty years
i came out of the ah the seal teams and i started a foundation to help veterans get jobs that totally failed
ah and then we saw the <unk> ah <unk> myself and wife ah to get idea admitted a for profit and so i place that's high performing that's into senior leadership positions in as we're doing this do companies are just bad at hiring
um
they still don't know how to do now it took that blueprint that book just takes us special operations forces have over the past half ah century evolved probably the longest behavioral interview ah in in in how to implement that into your company
and start building teams that
right right but google's not gonna be able to put you ah in the wake do and flutter kicks all day right
so then you gotta find other ways to test people's medal i suppose and and i am curious how haven't read the book yet is there anything in there about that like a non <unk> ways to test
so there there are we don't get into the means as much as the ah at the strategy of having the town mindset but yeah don't don't take your ah candidates down to the surf zone you'll end up in pretty <unk>
ah situation
not a good idea
it's it's applying the ad the pressure in the interview process and having a <unk> process from assessments and you there's a lot of things people just don't have interviews well right when you watch george <unk>
he will apply the pressure so companies sometimes will call us not to hire some of our people but to run interview processes for him and give us our opinion
and he will bring the pain on them you're talking thirty year <unk> who just
right
um some of them do but the good ones do but even role play i mean you put <unk> as big role play guy
it has found that about <unk> your folks
loves role play
cut right there
we started the show just to catch people off guard cut half of what they say out leave the rest out and make it a fucking headline
yeah dude so now your book will be chopped up when this comes out it'll say ah
author wrote a book about <unk> ah with role play
yeah we did the tim we did at the tim kennedy yes we like this guy can't stop talking about hitler hitler hitler hitler is obsessed with hitler i mean the show is called finding hitler but i mean
yeah
whatever
yeah
that's not our problem
not a problem not a problem
report the news i hear i was i was duly warned about an honesty so i now now i understand ah <unk> i love you ah do not fire me
honey get ready to move
ah ah a real quick speaking of <unk> in all sincerity here and he wrote he wrote the forward to your book and before we came on air you work with <unk> um how did that come about
so i was in his task unit as a a young seal officer ah i came from the marine corps as a <unk> marine on the enlisted side um and um bro you talk about good leaders he's as good as they come
because you know every one talks a big game what do we say in texas all
yeah
um he he practices what he preaches and so
then i went on to deploy ah you know in another nine times um but ah you know people already read the <unk> like that's the best part of the book
yeah now delegates it's pretty much <unk> on this one
somebody asked me yeah they they are like how do you think this book <unk> against extreme ownership and i'm like that's like asking ah how does your son who plays basketball in high school fare against ah you know the brown
right right
but i did not have to respond
it's different here's the thing managed ah anybody can be anybody in today's society can be famous over nights
if they get the right avenue right like david <unk> is the perfect example going on rogan man i didn't know who that was
and so he went on joe rogan ah <unk> i wasn't familiar with cause i'm i'm military iran i'm a civilian ah book but he goes on rogan and crushes and your like are oh great it depends on the opportunities and where you are
um and then you're messaging after it on top of an clearly what you are writing about is extremely important for today's world and helping getting jobs when you come out
um and maybe the show will be the platform for you um for you as a person why was this so important to write
you ah ah i fundamentally the ah the strongest our fortunes nations our economy in and people don't take that seriously you know it is our duty as american citizens to make sure that thing is a strong response because when it is we have everything we need in the military
and and for that coming out if you can find purpose in a lot so many vets nowadays say naughty i didn't i don't know my wide oh no my purpose yeah you've got one purpose get a job make the economy stronger
and and that your duty to the next generation of military leaders dominant
ah ah why do you think it's so hard to get through people's heads of why they should hire military veterans like this is one that i will never understand
it is a lot of misconceptions out there men honestly i mean it's it's how do you translate ah intangible skills and tangible skills when we all know from people that have developed if you're and if you're as a sports coach or as a leader in the military
you know that someone's resume is far less important in their ability to fuck and change on the fly right to absorb information make quick decisions and in turn that information to good decisions
you don't mean at that you can't you can teach people to do as such you can't teach people but people that can do it under extreme <unk> are few and far between and those are the people you want and those like high level positions
yes or or and even lower level positions like i i don't understand that as well like i got my first taste of an arranged fifteen um when i directed that i was the first time we're most of the people behind the camera were veterans right
they didn't have as much experience as is typical people in hollywood but the work ethic at the <unk> any of those lazy <unk> like three to one and after that i mean my mind completely changed where elisha subdued
if you're not hiring military veterans to do all the sheets like ah you're missing out on i mean cause it's something you don't have to teach them you don't have to teach them were worth at ethic whatsoever of what like to get up early and work hard on us up like
that's already instilled in everybody that comes out of the military as a civilian my god man is the first fucking people i would hire over any these fucking <unk> was like
my dad did this or i got in this or whatever and its like well well great how was i can help my company you know
so the book is not exactly you know an argument for why you should hire veterans ah but as a whole it speaks to you harder for character you hire for attitude you you had hired for mindset
industry experience which is how <unk> percent <unk> higher is not a predictor of success it's not just because somebody has five years of marketing ah you know experience doesn't mean they're good at marketing
if you find somebody with all the right attributes and you train him or he just say they will <unk> they will <unk> those people eventually and and it's frustrating um you know the systemic challenges with veterans and you know were civilians get this
cause with beyonce you know come in out world war two pretty much every one served in the military for the most part and they had they understood
they had to yeah
yeah thence to <unk> veterans it's now the one percent versus <unk> percent
while minutes its point four five percent actually agree on any specific yes i think i think in the world war two as like fifteen point eight percent to the now point four five percent yeah
right
so it's a different world now obviously
to a <unk> point five percent ah their perceptions are based off what they see the movies where hollywood is always gonna be the best recruiting tool for the military it's also its worst enemy when you get out
that's why shows like seal team are so important like they get out all right they don't church up and he the bullshit and it saw it's one thing to be to challenge some of those issues and take him on in a network and environment is tough when you're murdering people basically
but um they get old they get a lot right and all those guys are huge supporters and voters wallets when they got into the program in the first place tyler like it is you know tyler
<unk> grey
he's a he's a fucking magnet he is a magnet for good and talented people i don't know what it is about him that makes that happen maybe he's jesus hard to say
it seems like people first of all he's one of the hardest working human beings i've ever met my life he's also brilliant and an operator so it's
people flocked to him to be able to expression like that and i talked to people i i've been on set a couple times i talked to the people that work on that show the been in hollywood for years and they they don't talk about that's the same way that other people out there do
there's there's something different about the way they speak and you can tell that just experience right
like that's old as its experience one on one with a human being that's the reason nobody hates gay people anymore everybody was afraid gay people fifteen years ago and like oh everybody's gay cool no no now no one cares anymore as there is some <unk>
um behalf of the general public to deal with with veterans is to deal with them in general right when we're also really bad at asking for help we needed to
so all these things come together and used the the result unfortunately very often is subdued alone and is a part of the fucking <unk> and you know what i mean that the to to common standard here and it's it is what it is and we have to educate
at the end of the day that's what <unk> us
we were lucky to have served in a tribe really some of the last tribes that exist ah ah in the u s and when you leave environment where all you knew was team and <unk> de corp
it's hard to come back especially when you see the leadership the national capital region where we expect our leadership to be the best and we get the exact opposite they can even work with you know together with some civility
when you come back from a military environment and you're like what the hell is going on
very disappointing we've got the best military that you could possibly have we have the best idea the best fundamental idea that any countries based on
and i think it's two parts one is individual liberty in the other part is what an okay said you have to answer reason when to pull yourself up and the pole the next gap with you
those are the two fundamental and fundamental guiding principles of most americans lives i hope but somehow we end up every single year with the <unk> possible leaders like what what does they say about american culture that we're not able to put people in
i think maybe the presumption that everybody's on the same page as a dangerous presumption because clearly that a lot of fucking ah snakes out there and we've we've put that part of our brain and hold because our lives are busy
but it might be time to start paying a little bit of attention to what's going on in politics again not just fucking read sharing stupid shit on facebook but actually pay attention to who seeing what how foolish at both these parties are
and how they're basically just fucking using you to get what they want i think it's really important for people to fucking turn inward and start looking at themselves and how they've allowed the shit to happen because we have to prevent it from continuing we have to stop it in its tracks
we have just prevented from having a gun as well like we're we're not learning a lessons right now everybody's
it's fucking stupid
if you don't take an interest in politics politics will surely take an interest in you and i think a lot of people are now seeing that and that the the amount of people that don't get out though is is i don't know if i want to say disgusting
but you that is your civic duty to get out though and you know when you think people are gonna wake up they're gonna start ah getting a lot more involved in
quite frankly veterans
we need more veterans like dan <unk>
right
ah in there ah with you know dan has shown the ability to reach across island have a civil conversation yet that guy's definitely the candidate for twenty twenty-four i i don't doubt that one bit
maybe you're probably right as
maybe his own party in their ah in their in their fucking deep but hurt state that therein right now we don't even notice over yet by the way but in their deep but hurt state
they're gonna lash out at anybody that gives anything talk towards the middle and that is the fucking dumb as shit of all time if you will make yourself truly irrelevant become the tea party start to shout
thou shalt not our ah shall not <unk> over and over until your ears bleed and their ways like all right well we learned the lesson that and anymore
right
if if you think you can go play this game whatever the game is without negotiating and taking other people's it's not about giving up ground it's about taking other people's lives and can and and circumstances and the fucking ah mind
when you're making decisions that's a good that's a trait of a good human being to do that by the way it doesn't doesn't make you weak to consider the feelings and plight of other people
how how can that possibly true because the strongest people we know take that thing into consideration the go fight and die for it doesn't make any goddamn sense
but somehow he replied that politically where you know it's it's somehow perceived as a weakness or <unk> to agree with the fact like nowadays this is information this is
here just get out of here without stop or we can't do it i don't know why i don't know why
i don't either and since speaking a politics did you did you feel like you had a political hangover today when you got up and started the day like he's now it looks if it's monday were recording us on monday
you wake up you you you walk the streets you get to talk to people or see people's expressions ah which you're feeling today
well so my wife in our downtown ah on saturday shortly after they made the ah the ah the announcement and people drive around hearken and and great you know i understand that they're happy for the the their side
but the biggest realization for me when i i feel like something's coming
ah the <unk> are are are are like lain in wait but they got some they are just they just eerie feeling but my whole take away from this as one people need to be just so less polarized
and and so less emotional and and i know that's mainly to left but federal government has become way too freaking big
and that's what needs to change it needs be pushed down the state and local level as it was always intended and it will put less emphasis on federal government if we end up doing that
how you mean like the tenth amendment says to
yeah
i mean you know it was one of the bell of goddamn rights maybe we should take it seriously or we to do whatever who cares
if the if the liberal party libertarian party was so messed up ah
i mean the ideas haven't been <unk> out they're too they're too young their economic policies are nonsense and not because they know what is gonna take him seriously you have to have something that is applicable
and scale are not just a good idea to its we're in twenty twenty now you can't say like you know what would be great is if this like yet would be great but that sounds like a reality
you also need a popular candidate
well yeah i mean
that we'll go out there and and you've got us somebody's got to turn the tide because cause right now
whose their p r person because i didn't see joe <unk> on any news station ever like i know she made appearances here and there but you you you need
you can hear man
if you're trying to start a new party you have to have like a good thirty forty people all saying the same exact shit all the same time and being able to defend those points as well as we believe this because of this challenge me on that maybe i can i can flex on a little bit
but here is why we believe what we believe will you guys believe oh well here's why what you're thinking right now is an is is right technically but an application it won't work right
and here's here's the last forty years of proof of that now let's try something different but no it's not that dislike like thou shall not <unk>
yeah yeah yeah
fucking and fuck the two party system is admirably tell me anything i need information with which to make a decision you know what i mean
right ah but you are not gonna get it i know you're not gonna get in an e-mail joe <unk> we had on her v p of internet on the shows by
um ends the the promise initially was a man joe <unk> gonna come on next week or whatever and she didn't end up coming on the show um
probably because i let him up a little bit for c dump shed
either way man you don't turn down ten point three million listeners right you try to get your message out there despite whatever it is because it's hard to go out to an audience of the size um anywhere right now
ah you wouldn't get an on jimmy fallon after going on jimmy fallon us in a matter of if people are gonna challenge you're not still wanna get your message out the listeners and to think again you need a candidate in that party who is popular enough to say all right
we're gonna start voting for this we're gonna start taking this party seriously regardless of it takes votes away from one or the other is that it's always been one of the biggest arguments that's right is somebody s been afraid to run down the middle with
it's gonna take votes from this other candidate or you you you have to stop being afraid of that um yes you're gonna take votes from another candidate but to know in order to establish a serious third party
someone's got started and and it's got to be serious um and and then there's got to be some financial backing as they didn't have that much money there
no ross <unk> to pay for himself
yes
that's why said like i've been criticized for this before but i think bloomberg should have run as an independent i think that bernie sanders should have run as an independent i think mitt romney should probably have run as an independent cause he represents a different wing of the republican party
look this isn't about a versus b this is about what the fuck is best for my goddamn country right what is all this happening right now that made this worse all the fucking blood has been shed to make this happen
like we had this idea that individual liberty is really important and we think we can govern our entire lives around it and we sent men to battle for four years over and over
one major war every twenty years in the history this country to to support that fucking idea show me where the fucking values and that now show me what fucking reverence is being given back to that fucking promise
and that and that ah sacrifice just so you can spit at cars face and complain about fascism in a country that has never seen fascism that's be real you will win
i don't know that anything and american politics can be fixed with voting at this point honestly i don't think i don't think it can and until people change the way they think about what is right what is wrong
right is not correct and left is not correct correct is correct bitch
right
the idea that you would say let's of republican talking point anything that a talking point to me is bullshit i don't wanna hear that prove it then i don't believe it this is not god it was twenty twenty
i have all the information in the world on this little device radio had somehow we can't figure out how to agree on fucking reality
ah and it's not coming anytime soon um
is it because we don't have those old tribal lines anymore because of <unk> like we don't i can't dislike dislike the other country and take care mine because i am after like everybody knows added that really what it is when are we that fucking pathetic
to your point about you all the bloodshed ah ah it's an afterthought in in people's minds if if it's even there at all i i mean it there's a sense of entitlement in america
that americans are almost entitled force soldiers going forward go overseas and given their lives in digging the tune into the <unk> or whatever ah you know ah t v shows ah is popular
so this will be the first of many years on november eleventh i usually go to ottawa to celebrate with some canadian ah
have to gather the version the special operations
and i've never seen a country like
let's say the united kingdom celebrate a holiday like that americans don't celebrate our veterans day anywhere close to what canada and and britain do everyone stops
every town has memorial <unk> wearing red poppy you've never seen such unity and that's why i i it's sad to say that i served twenty years in every live eleven november i do my best to make it to ah together
really
yeah
no shit
yes
this this be the first year because i want them the kelvin restrictions and to launch the book
yeah
but yeah
that's crazy that's crazy ah um me personally ah as far as political hangover goes today um i typically watch the the there's a today show or something on in the morning when i'm get ready
after work just to come and catch up on the news ah this was the first day that wasn't dominated by madness over trump and no anger over trump and everything else
they almost did know what to talk about on the new you know um and it was a a couple things like hey that was at this celebration of biden and harrison
they seem loss when they couldn't talk about anything regarding trump
we already know what the riots talk about for the next four years right
no that that's i i was trying to guess that earlier on
revolution what is it what are they going to talk about
provided things stay as they are with these counts um was gonna talk about is how the republicans are trying to prosecute biden forward that russia bullshit which is hilarious by the way i mean
something different
for now for that <unk> involvement in which we know he answered with it don't don't be naive let's let's be adults here
yeah the big guy
i don't i don't we'll we'll see about we will see it probably is admitted it it definitely pass the smell test and we know that those <unk> are are legit now not not necessarily don't know that biden's the big guy necessarily we know those <unk> of legit
anyways ah when we hear about that cars are holding to control you that you are there also going to probably win the house in the <unk> the republicans probably will
in twenty twenty two
because there's things are too tumultuous right now for biden to maintain like a positive he is gonna be a lot of war going on with the democratic
and everybody right now
and <unk> was burned down the guardian portland d n c headquarters and rode at such a profane shit would bind name on it
why he wasn't he wasn't progressive
he let the inmates run the asylum the democratic party will fracture
yeah it's gonna fracture so they're gonna be in in twenty twenty-two the republicans will win back the house and its <unk> bulls on parade at that point right they are gonna be lining him up with on everything they can
for the next two years and then c n n and m s n b c will be defending biden the same way the fox has been defending trump except for when they haven't right
all right it's it's nonsense it's it's like a play it's like ah it's it's
all right yeah yeah yeah
from ah what is called
the <unk> right they now sell it for a home version by the way if you're curious they do
no question which line its gonna go down and get me a very little bed but it's gonna go down to one general area you know what every single time this is where we're fucking <unk> we're in the best country that could possibly exist right
right
because of our geographical stand off because the idea that we built the country on individual liberty we have the best opportunity in this country to stave off any kind of attack
while also flourishing as much as as as a culture can but you know we do nothing we're idiots we we start to see some succession like i deserve this like a few a few achieve something
there's a reason why all these dumb <unk> when they win awards get up on stage look at us like to thank everybody involved in this now because they really believe it because they probably don't let's be real but that is exactly how your brain should work your brain should once you accomplish something
even the smallest thing during the day with oh fucking i was great starting at about what allowed you the opportunity to do that stuff now because you didn't work hard it's not because of that because everybody's fucking work and hard doesn't make you special work hard okay
and makes you doing the bare minimum frankly so yeah i did this great thing and work today you know it was really great as when i didn't have to worry about shit at home because my wife and had already taken care of or whatever the case is right
that's a big fucking mental leap to make as a human being and if you can start to implement should like that your real life at the you'd i goddamn happier
the guy i i work on that it's easier to talk about is very difficult to do that shit real time because you're so much in your own head but you don't think about at the time and intensely like <unk> have said this right
i i i'm i'm lucky cause i think for me personally at least in my relationship in my home life um i enjoy my wife and i enjoy my children um a lot
so when i go home i i don't have an issue of like holy shit i've got a fire on the news or get angry about anything like i don't exactly love my family in its real right ah i don't wanna people who don't
and that one of them fortunately so i don't have those issues and problems but everybody else who is i think they use politics and everything else is a crutch of like while this is why my life sucks in anything
yeah it's not it's not heart attack now and an earlier day and think about what you should be grateful for it and then maybe if its people go show some gratitude it's not it doesn't take a whole lot of time to do either one will say that something that i'm a dude that lives in my own had quite a bit i'm heady
which is an annoying thing to say but it's true i fucking second round the stared and think for forty-five minutes and people think i'm nuts right or i walk around and people are standing around me some time even if it's at my home
um and that's off putting to people like you can't just act like that now so i know i'm <unk> and should i think about the stuff a lot but it does trap me up like i get caught in that moment
where i'm just like <unk> let me think about everything that's going on right now no you should i gotta you gotta train yourself right <unk> days it takes them to train something into your daily routine that will last forever
<unk> days typically speak for a normal person so southern heart adieu to <unk> have ever right and strategy i think we're all feeling out i pretty much everybody i know feels the shit
but how do we how do we enjoy what's happening in real time instead of being nostalgic later cause this is the only time we've got this this resource of time is the only one that we can replace
ah and i'll say this and that is the only thing that i have figured out in this life and i figured out in a very very early age that time um was the most valuable thing that we have
so i i consider myself good at that but batted other things um i don't know about you
i'm not gonna give bandwidth things i can't change or effect ah i am just over and at the end of the day you know <unk> said this is like you people get so worked up that trumps can elected while he may be moves the as myth like two degrees to the right
biden gets elected yeah may be four degrees to the left or we still moving in the same general direction
yeah
it's like you <unk> forensics i went to u t ah that when they lose a game it's like their whole week is destroying
or they've had a rough couple weeks
ah they had they had a rough fifteen years
shrug your shoulders you're not in the <unk> you're an alumni and just move on with your ah your your day
that's one thing about about i'll admit that yeah i'm terrible dude i went to hire state so i'm fucking terrible
when will you guys usually dominate
i know
yeah i but but you don't dominate
that will that will eat away at me for ever and like that's something i'm terrible i now fully admit that
i wonder what what the what are we getting out of that exactly like i'm a fan of various sports teams what do what do i personally get out of them winning
ah so meet me personally
say by the way and because what we lose when they lose
right and or is is it is there <unk> right cause i don't actually lose anything
well you was you was a personally amen
maybe maybe i gain some <unk> you know being being shot at in my brain
yeah
for some period of time maybe it makes me happier but there's probably other ways to accomplish that but i don't get so emotionally invested in and should i can't control i guess maybe as to your point right like their stuff that i can do to have that <unk> release for example cocaine
i know you are waiting for me or stops and said cocaine and it's the reason you're gonna say it is because fuck fucking true
cocaine and m d m a and you can have that same <unk> release without doing show what happened on saturday is is not a fact you probably won't be awake for the game
you'll be out of friday night
be due to wake to the game
i'm go to well i mean if you stayed up all night the i prior was my my joking
so here is like i i don't do cocaine therefore i i have to to live on sports or something so
but it's a drug right i mean you like you to his point over the <unk> went on that whole fuck is only the echo here because his point we give so much power over us our daily mood to shut that we literally can't control how stupid is that
that's like canada fucking loaded gun to salt to a crazy person dislike i will see what happens they are unique as you literally have no control over whether or not ohio state wins
you also have no control over them vast majority the shit that happens your life where you have control over those the real question and i'm not asking <unk> i wanna know you think about that
time ah to me it's time i don't know what it is to you but said time and i've always been very my voices i'm impatient and then i will credit i gotta get through this line are yet to get through this whatever because my time is so valuable
and i realized that you can't that is the one thing you just cannot get back that that's why i'm impatient that it's not the other stuff i just don't wanna wait in line or just don't wanna do this i just value my time that much um i don't know what yours is
i i i think why i'm so respect for people's time and i won't ask for a lot to help cause i i i don't want to take up their time um i my time is is is very important to me um it sometime like build brutal bout ah you you look
don't don't waste my time cause i'm not gonna waste yours but when we put to in in the context you know leaving after twenty years ah between you know
lost a lot of brothers
and i'd like just dominated my life for like three years during the transition and there's the you know
thinking about them
thinking about them thinking about everything think think about how the war was fought and how i just totally disagree with the evolution of that more i mean it was mister <unk>
it was vietnam two point oh man come on
in in the fact that they're still young eighteen year old in afghanistan
yeah
by just it gets me but there was a point to where and this is why why did you leave the military got him around i've got a strong core of like seals runner ah there's like four of us were boys we just don't talk about the military stuff anymore
cause we don't want to eat any more bandwidth we all gave twenty-four we're done we're pushing behind in in our job is to live now for the gazette in <unk> come home live in their absence in living memory memory
but that sort of you know when you asking to contextualize it that's immediately with jumps in my my mind
let me let me ask you you guys this question ah because you both seem to be around the same age and you both served you both overseas looking back at it now right all these years later
would you have gone back if you could have you know talk to yourself at that age when you entered ah knowing what you know now would you have done in both of you
yes
same with you yeah
but because gods we're wanna go yeah gods we're gonna go i was gonna be there with me and quite frankly you join i'm sure is the same for you joined because you love your country
right
and you know the only thing necessary for evil is for good men stand by and do nothing then of that quote but it becomes less about the united states because you you get older
you you see that i hate to say that the civilian populace is not as great force as they should be
sure
um and i don't need a pat on the back i don't but for my guys i wanted them to be respected and the remainder of your deployments come about is just about the guys in the team
so the anger then is your anger once you got out you think about that you said vietnam to point out is it towards the government and of like hey guys why the fuck didn't you have this figured out before you send us over there
i would say more so than anybody that was a member of the government at that time the generals and i said this a couple weeks ago too
these <unk> knew and they knew they were fucking vietnam survivors if you are caught that all these general officers around they know this bullshit they knew the thing with a at least as bullshit with afghanistan that's a <unk> move i thought was inappropriate but it is what it is
um that's the mission creep that should happens but with a rock that was all nonsense that was a dick cheney that's all that was dick <unk> trying to get rich that's all this or had some fucking thing against saddam hussein
ah or or whatever the fuck right i mean he it's funny how cheney and and that other <unk> was the second theft under bush which is then um i can see a stupid face in my head with a congress move for anyways
<unk> ah don <unk>
yeah he those guys you can see them shaking hands with ah with saddam back in the day known we are selling them weapons and shell all of a sudden now they're against them
because of what changed between the mid eighties and the early two thousand with the rack exactly what change nothing is the answer ah so yeah i mean there's anger to be spread around but i think the general's bear the the the biggest part of that burden
ah because they had the authority they may look it's different twenty twenty than it was in two thousand right so generals back then wouldn't have jumped on twitter and like hey this guy is an asshole we shouldn't be deploying whatever the fuck
maybe that's a good thing that they didn't do that but they were the most authoritative people on something that they knew would become mission creep like we're just gonna go on and stabilize unlike any time any place any anytime anybody during a military operation says
we're just gonna dot dot dot go ahead and fuck and set your shit on fire cause not coming back to me and it's it's the <unk> shit of all time
but i'm i'm not i wouldn't say i'm really angry justice as more disappointment than anger but you can't be angry for that a lot
that's good cause i i i looked <unk> we have a bunch of friends who are in the military um between us in said there is some some people are just pissed he's angry of like man i i did not i thought i was doing something that i was eyed about
i mean i think that anger is led too is often an <unk> for all like that that when when you hear veterans <unk> about shit it's usually ah i read directions and <unk> of what's really going wrong with them and here there's a number of different things going wrong the one
they've lost a support system which is difficult like he was saying two is that any kind of threat at all seems to me like something i need to be on my toes for and it's like a dog right like a few a few and and jessie had a dog and you are walking
the dog's gonna be pretty calm if jesse walks her dog and anybody comes near the dogs meet again get protective and for us the first thing that happens to me when i feel dangers i get fucking pissed off like i get as angry as i've ever been in my life are very brief period of time
and then my i get television i start looking for should to do you don't mean i think that's a common thing for people had been
trained to do that all the time it's difficult turn that off i don't know if you ever really turn it off completely because even when you get back here like we realize as <unk> as people walked through extremely dangerous situations
and gotten so comfortable that oftentimes we ignored some of those dangerous situations moving back here and doing all the stuff a lot of stuff like <unk> my interest that will never <unk> yours like the way someone is holding her hands as any and there's all kinds o fucking examples of it
but it becomes problematic in your life you can't keep doing that so you got find a different outlet for and you have to fucking find some kind of purpose and i'm working on that now still after ten years the shed
find some kind of purpose that instead of my heightened level of awareness coming off as angry like i'm doing something positive with that shit
right
because otherwise little fucking you you alive always i don't wanna be fucking mad all the time i don't want any that bullshit
yeah and and mike you're doing something positive as well ah with this book um i i know you are a busy man in your in your own tour right now ah tell everybody where they can find your book
and and where they can grab at i know <unk> different now it used to be although i gotta go to barnes and noble nothing <unk> like um it was feel safer to is as hey man just go to amazon
and if you only give us a really quick <unk> of what it is exactly
yes
yeah it's it's it's about a town mindset which is the strongest tool you can have to dominate whatever the hell you do it's recognizing that your people are the most strategic competitive advantage
you'll ever achieve human can maintain exactly it's not your systems it's not your technology it's always been and always will be people in the military is always understood that
it doesn't matter if you have seven people to go up against a hundred if you have seven people that are better than those hundred they will wipe them out
awesome awesome or you can check out the talent war ah it is out now on amazon right
amazon inner beliefs sold is there an audio book for you there is and again the best part of it is the ah introduction by <unk>
did he do his own he did he did and i you know i try to do a mix between <unk> biden and <unk> interest income officer genuine
did you do it did you do it on your book you got
hey that was the hardest thing i've ever done i went home at four p m and i looked my wife and i said just let me go to sleep
yeah
in using different <unk> i was spent
it's crazy isn't it
his last audio book was and fucking
july
brutal man and it's i how i made as yours
ah two and my co author was another two
okay yeah yeah yeah yeah so i those it's usually about four days and you're <unk> and like basic what people don't understand that his actress me <unk> something you have to stop and go back
and it's like the words that are something here and there
but it's offensive fluid sends you have to read the entire sentence i read the whole paragraph you have to read the whole goddamn paragraph again so that that experience alone why they would prevent me from ever right the second
no right will you just like do you have regular fucking
you just get hired and british guy next time and hell
oh yeah eighty percent
which they got all the novels my my my wife listen still
yeah but i will say this is because when you're writing a book um it should come from you there for every author who's out there who's who's thinking about writing a book
read it yourself people want to hear from you
unless your are ah carlo harris nobody wants to hear her voice like i've seen more means from <unk> people about the way she speaks they fucking hate her holy shit
it's it's an <unk> kennedy look
so they but they hate her little less than they hate trump i guess
right which is weird
little bit we'll see that you know
yeah i mean we'll see
we'll see how it picks up um speaking with shy we're gonna talk about that ah after we get to the sponsors and i believe dakota meyer is going to join us here ah with that's mike we greatly appreciate you being on the show
a man did false next robin
thank you for your time today you are you are a great dude and i look forward to reading the talent war which is available everywhere i go to amazon it's easiest to get in two days or free with amazon prime
we get some sponsors who pay for the whole shit wagon to be on the air first and foremost talking about <unk> dot com forward slash drink <unk> has the best mattresses in the lands
you remember the military a first responder a teacher or work in the governments you get thirty percent off for life as every item in the store that is pillows sheets mattresses adjustable bases
you name its you get thirty percent off the rest of us <unk> are relegated to a twenty-five percent off deal ah but when you buy matches she gets you free pillows and i can promise you
ah the pillows are just as great as the goddamn matches you got a hundred and forty dollar savings too um i will say this ah hate to tip my hand here
but they're gonna have a monster black friday sale um it's gonna be how monstrous at the sides that guy's dick that you always get texas it's gonna be that big huge ah black friday sales to get ready for that
and as always a <unk> dot com for slash drink <unk> they've got a thirty-six month pay as you go program at no interest there
and all of the deals i just mentioned are applicable with that some means and that shit for like thirty-eight dollars
or slashed drinking bros that wine club
yeah i like wine
yeah big fan
pretty much
pretty much i look there's two things you like in this in this life it is you like drugs you like wine
while like more than that like stakes as well but
what about me
no no ah
i do definitely wine i it's it's it's i had the benefit i guess a few of these days you definitely can call devon who could ever call the call living in the bay area the bed of of benefit in any way was because i could go to wine country whenever wanted to
true
right
true
and very diverse like grapes are very diverse a taste different to me so it's it's i enjoy it so if you're a wine <unk> or if you just like it or you're trying to get into it or what it is or if he does want good wine is a really good place to go
it is it's six bottles for thirty hours
for any level that you ah for a wine club for any level of experience with wine you have the you you can answer questions about random bullshit they can tell you can with your flavor palate is but if you have more precise information you could do that as well
and then a graduate so every new ah ever knew why should you get should be closer to your own particular test which is good by the touch our food for people have never used before
that's the best way to get in something like that it's like having your own fucking wind butler basically
it's amazing ah so they'll send you the six bottles you try him out you let him know few like him and then um you can continue on like that in the meantime again <unk> turned out six bottles for thirty dollars
regardless of what your situation is
that's holiday too dude
and it's all it's also like curated wines as well
yeah
these are like two buck chuck caesar i guarantee you that these every single bottle on your fucking <unk> gonna be worth more than five dollars per which is basically what you're paying
ah dude i the last blossom i had there wasn't a bad one in the bunch man and my wife and i are huge fans good and try <unk> dot com ford slashed drink in rose that's try <unk> dot com for a slashing bros if nothing else
thanksgiving and christmas is upon us um six bottles for thirty dollars you you really can't beat its us humans will load up for the holidays because lord knows you're going to need its
especially if your family is on two different sides of the political aisle um
you don't to worry about that dakota
no really i don't i i
spending christmas without family knowing how my girl this year it can be peaceful it can be nice but i'll i'll get that wine put under the christmas tree forget that i got it
and then i open it up i'll get drunk
yeah
yeah yeah are you back on the booze you drink and is this
you know i mean i'm not gonna say i'm i'm not not like i used to but i'll have a few drinks here and there you know because i have a couple here a couple there
proud of you yeah i had launch this week and then after the selection um i don't who did and i have shied away from the beers obviously as you is you're hit your early thirties
yeah you look like me
right then
i'll never get there
it's a lot of a lot <unk> these days with this when i was like you know and i'm going oh and i was a got twisted x <unk> and um yesterday
you would you have my hammer down
ah the the big dogs they got some a p these that are um eight per cent last sent
yeah
sent their wings and call on um maybe it's the <unk> haze their their famous for that one
i just don't like like i just don't like um how bloated i feel like two days afterwards like how fat i'd still
that's the way i feel today that's the way feel today but i i also knew it right i was going into the weekend and i was like i cool
you get the mindset
yeah cause i didn't find out dan and i i collectively so many talented up we did with the eight hours worth of podcasts in the last two weeks i i slots my i was pretty sick like of saturday my body gave out a pretty sick
um and i slept most of the fucking weekend them um me i know and i didn't find out about the election and so i i think like six thirty that night ah saturday night when i woke up and i was like a shit they had actually called this
um you know mike was talking about a a a little bit earlier here um what was your reaction to its ah you think it's real
ah ah which part
ah the like the the mail in <unk> and um
i mean i think it's over right i mean the collections over that this one is over like it's i i just hoped the republicans don't make the same ah mistake that i feel like the democrats did over the last four years and just try to find out mistakes and i hope this isn't there their tagline
like russia was the last four years i hope dead you know look i i do think we need to do do justice to make sure that you know that the system was you know that it was fair
um
but if they like okay pay ah we lost we just need to say it okay we lost we got we got be
right
um we'll go back to drawing board like this don't make this don't play the victim card or the next four years right like
that kind of begs the question what is the point of all this right is the point for your team to win or is the point for america to win that's why i challenge the binary political system itself we've turned
republican talking points versus left hugging or ah liberal talking points into when versus lose or win versus lose depending on how you see the world right that's ridiculous
theirs their right and wrong answers to questions and we've somehow manner manage to pigeon hole ourselves into one of two choices and every fucking year people complain about it
can you believe we got to choose between these two <unk> again it's because of you
yeah
every bit of it is because of you because of you you me every all we're all <unk>
but but i mean yeah i mean i think our <unk> i think this is probably that the danger of a democracy right like there there's a danger to it like you it's kind like a gun
it can be a very very powerful tool it can feed your family protect your family it can literally be used for a lot of things right but it can also be the same thing that kills your entire family right in the wrong hands
and not used with integrity and not knowing the system being very familiar with the tool and all these things and what i think the problem is right now is that we've got a bunch of people who are educated on how our system works
who are educated on on and and the people who are going in there putting into power they're using this in some reality t v show like they're betting on on sunday night football right it's it's done with the same mindset
and and what happens is as with democracy can be the best tool to give us the <unk> country on the face the planet but it can be a system that <unk> on itself and turns everybody against each other because there is so much freedom right
com communism is a more systematic bureaucratic approach to something right like it's it's it's it's regulated it's kind like the military communism is is kind like how the military could be right
our socialism socialism is the military socialism right pretty much socialism but when you have democracy you have all this freedom and all this power you put in the wrong hands
it can be the same the same thing that makes you free can also be the same thing that kills us
right it can and i mean that's why ah there will never be as a a successful socialist country ever is because it inevitably turns to communism now what we found about free market capitalism in things like that is again thrive pretty well
without that happening without turning to fascism for example which is a far right ideology but for some i don't know if it's a corrective measure that society's taken or whatever or people is weak
but it seems like the idea of individual responsibility has gone by the wayside for the most part
but there is no
right
there is no accountability
right so we we you you you are afforded in america you're afforded the privilege it's not a right cause people had to fight for the shit as a privilege yeah you are afforded the privilege of being able to live in a society like capitalism
without the bullshit from a society like socialism or communism where people are telling you what to do all the time that's what this is supposed to be but if you continue to not pay attention to what's going on
and to allow these what seem like simple comforts and your life at the time or maybe they're not bad enough to really go after
we have to focus on the goal of making sure that individual liberty is the most important a well respected facet of our entire system right otherwise we're fucked
but but but look look this this is what you're seeing across the board right now in our politics and and and across the world are ink across the board of america um is the repercussions
ah taking the easy route look at the look at the bigger the baby boomers there there there were the prime when the first generations that decide to become the victims
a greater desire
i mean there's there's something about culture that when when you become protected you start looking any bird
exactly and and so like they started they started that mindset and now their children started getting participation trophies right and now you look at the whole society that's voting right now
nobody wants to look in the mirror and say you know what i fucking law so i need to go back and work on something
right now we're a bunch a dull blades
we're bunch a dull blades
basically we've never seen steel before we've never been sharp
but but on the backside of it oh the the military that we have in the first responder community that we have is second to none and its provided the same like we have empowered the problem
right because we've had men and women who've been willing to raise their right hands and didn't have to ah we've had people willing to go out and and protect our society and still stand up
when it's not you know a popular in the court of public opinion people still been willing to do this and they are we're basically enabling this behavior to continue right we we got police protecting the same people who are saying fuck the police
right
you don't mean and and so
and there's no social cost to be paid
for that which is that is a problem
and the problem is is when there are no consequences to your actions and i blame eighty percent of this on one one piece of america
and that's big tech
big tech
yeah yeah i i i am with you um and so these things become public utilities
um it's gonna get worse and worse and worse and and look we saw in this election where when shit look we've at between this and <unk> revolution i've done around fifteen hundred episodes
i've never been censored before ah we've we've been shadow band on the show that show ah i even had a social media post on facebook that was shadowy and this morning i i didn't election show
um and there's something that pops up on youtube if you say the word election now that says the a p has called the election for for joe biden for more information on on this and it was pointed out to him by the listeners and i was
by the way it's not in the a p power to call election or any other media outlets only with the <unk> and federal election commission to do that and that's not gonna happen until at the earliest december thirteenth
and it and it ran and it by the way so underneath um on youtube if you're do if you do in a video um it it it puts its got a website on it ah c i s a dot <unk> slash rumor control i don't know if you guys know what it is i i clicked it
um and it says its the national risk management um or election security and and it says miss and differ this information can undermine public confidence in the electoral process as well in our democracy
goal late for that
yeah
we late for that
they should should ran that ad fifteen years ago
what what they're doing it now currently now on videos on youtube and it keeps getting scarier and scarier where just like what the fuck is next
well here's what i don't like i don't why when any kind of private organization and look we will support private business here but we have to be fucking pragmatism as well when any private organization gets that powerful than their voice becomes louder than yours
and when their voice becomes louder the government has two choices to listen to that voice or to develop a louder voice themselves in the only way the government develops a louder voices by taking voice away from the people in both these cases
there is no good solution
but but i don't know there is i'm i disagree there is a good solution with big tech if i go buy a gun a gun has to be registered to somebody's name
right
it has to be
yes
right so if i'm gonna go and create an account on social media and uses platform that can be used to to emotionally charged people and to to to to mass you know gather people to do something for a cause
that should have to be registered to somebody's name because why is that gun registered to somebody's name to hold them accountable
where you where you are describing as biscuit the telephones were which is a public utility thing it makes sense people you hear the word register and that does not set well with a lot
okay okay so it it dyke
because how much how much power do we want the government to have do we not do we not want the capability to communicate with each other and honestly allow the internet is we have to have that
that's not what i'm saying now that's not that is not what i'm saying i'm not saying the government has to be the one
right but who would be then
what you know what if big tech if i'm going to create a platform in and and it's gonna be my platform then if if this account breaks the law
like they break the law that we already have set toward speech if i look at you and i say hey ross i'm gonna kill you you can go call the cops right now and i'm going to jail because you have proof of it
right
right so the same thing should be with the the same should is is like as text messages should be the same thing with social media sites that if something is said that breaks the law there should be no censorship decided from a private party
if this account breaks the law then guess what i come to use your big tech all you are the vault and had verified these people that's your responsibility as far as it goes the censorship
and i come to here and say whose account registered to and then that person is held accountable for breaking the law
so instead of what a section to thirty does which is basically <unk> people of our resolve tech companies of any illegal activity outside their <unk> that may have happened on their platform
you would recommend something like ah the tech companies just being complicit our compliant rather with the government <unk> case i understand that a principle
absolutely
but imagine a government where a o c is in charge and she's making lists of people who supported trump of
doing its own but its own but i'm saying it's but i'm saying it's already
i and i know i gotta i'm just display and devils avocado here because ah
well then i then i goes back to the american people voting and people they can trust and have that power
yeah but when have we done that who's the last fucking president that you trust
then what we do
i don't know that's been a question i think we need an overhaul the entire look for
well i mean i think i think more the bigger problem to all this is that the fact that honestly this president's not gonna change minds our our our three lives this present that gonna make any decisions that can affect my life or change what i do every single day
it's gonna have absolutely i i don't invest in stocks so i i don't give a shit about that i'll i'll bet i'll gamble my money i'll go and i'll invested in property or i'll do like that so that's gonna be on my performance
like this this president is not gonna affect its gonna effect absolutely nothing of the future for me
yeah and i've i've said this a a bunches times in the past where you know if you heated over president right um and in it affects your life day-to-day chances are you get bigger problems right
because look
you pray living off the government
why you say this
like let's think about our position specifically we're all business owners got right if i decide to sell my business today then i pay fifteen percent capital gains tax on in the rest as mine
right right
and for a month is a decent chance at least thats gonna be twenty-three percent
yes
right
yes
that affects my life
it does um but when i mean the idea that biden and his team are currently floating the idea that they're gonna make mask wearing mandatory nationwide
i mean idea
not that they have the constitutional authority to do anything like that or the fact that they're talking about then yeah i mean
it's already there
you can say whatever the fuck you whine about trump and how he sounds <unk> some times because he's at he's just an idiot it's negotiating in public and doesn't realize the way to the words he says that doesn't make it right
but it does shed some light on why he would do something like that he's not doing those things to be malicious he's doing it because he's a fucking emotional child and that's how we learn to negotiate over the years and some times is pretty goddamn effect it frankly but even if it wasn't
it's just that it's a strategy it's not it's not who he is at the corners of his person
so when i see people with the core of their character are arguing for the certain things like i want to be the champion of of social justice now despite the fact that i wrote the bill
that put all these men in prison and that my fucking vice president ah ah enforce that bill at the end the biggest state in the country and suppressed evidence to keep people present things like that
that should be o o and awakening right
yeah but but see your point it hasn't happened yet
no i don't think it will
after after a hill after hillary losing maybe there was some chance of biden at last year that that would have happened but now the biden one we're looking at another probably twenty years of his constant
no
fracture of the democratic party
oh yeah yeah yeah i mean look i mean look the democrats lost it it no matter how you look at it right they all they lost seats in the house um i mean that you know if the democrats don't go back and say ah you know
we barely like like donald trump got beat we didn't win ah car like the republicans probably should have done as well last you know last time um
i mean both of them have got to have a a major overhaul but but here's what i got to tell you is
but our republicans did do they came back out of losing to obama for a second time with mitt against mitt romney and they came out with donald trump and won
why so so so i i gotcha
they they made the adjustment
but i also think that was an accident i also think that was as much i i i
i don't think <unk> want that happen
no they definitely do not want that happen yeah
but but so my my thing to you is it is okay let's say we soon as whatever happens in the judicial system comes out and and decide to every prison is either way
if it is joe biden which i i actually believe at this point it's the <unk> over um we have got to stop talking about what they've done before
and we've just got to hope for the the the hope for the goodness of this nation they they come out and have learned from the mistakes and they're gonna do better over the next four years
that's all we can do like if we don't do that then we are just as bad as the left like we're just as bad as that you don't mean like we've got a hope that
well how do you how do you balance that how do you decide what to support what not to support for example
well how do you how do you pick how do you decide like what you know how you decide like when donald trump does some i mean you gonna forgive him for the shit
now i now i got all that yeah for sure but like how do you what what's the line here if if then if the democrats if the democrats win
and which which it seems to be the case we'll see how much voter fraud we know there's a lot of voter fraud we don't know how much an earth it'll be ah enough to swing anything but anyways it seems like they're gonna win if they win
um there are things that these guys have talked about that are untenable for the american economy
you are right
shutting down i'm not a fan of fracking i'm not a fan of long oil pipelines because the present unnecessary environmental challenges that to me is laziness we could figure out a better way to do it which is how do we put the effort towards we put the effort towards
and money towards nonsensical fucking energy ah substitution that are not feasible does in time we have to figure out better ways to do what we're doing already we're just trying to find out new ways which is stupid anyways
aside from stuff like that the green new deal that that commonly harris was a co author of brine that biden says oh no no no but look he's supported in theory right in the past
and and ah all this other stuff that's come with a party i want the country to succeed so and this is this is a good learning lesson for conservatives right now
because from the perspective of a liberal democrat in twenty sixteen in november of last of twenty sixteen they have a set of core beliefs that they think are gonna make this country the best they could be
trump was the complete opposite of that in their response was to just lose their fucking minds right now that isn't always the case so let's say you ride a train through the city
like you're on the wrong line but then you look at the map we can go up to more and then swap or
this train is still moving generally in the direction you needed to move so how do i fucking guide this thing the best i can with just <unk>
and the meantime because but there is a line no right like they start talking about green new deal or or nation wide mandating of certain things and that's crucial that's gonna be a fuck and problem for a lot of people man
look look let's let's don't take an <unk> before we got a headache right like let's start this off with the best mindset like we don't need this emotionally charged like we don't need like look let's let's don't be the same thing that we just <unk> about the last four years
well it's hard i i get when i say but it's hard it's hard not to do that when elsie and her colleagues are tied not make a list of people can who support trump i was as a trump supporter
i i got it
and i'm and i'm not and i'm obviously not an a o c supporter either but if either one of those sides sought to make a list of the other side and i'm gonna have a fucking promised that an all of you should to but
we are hunt what we're talking about we're talking about we're taking about different issues right like
well we are when the leaders of the party like michelle <unk> well like these people the seventy million people decided to vote for chaos and racism and how about to shut the fuck up shell how about that like she's one of the leader will regardless of having never run for politics and life
she's one of the leaders of the democratic party and what she says means a lot so she just called out seventy million people and told him that their fucking racist like how do you expect the other all they talk about right now so we need a unified <unk> yeah of course
you wanna unify right now while you're winning in the game you don't want there to be any more violent
i'm with you listen i am with you i i i am with you but all we can hope is that over the next four years day that that we can at least lead by example
that we don't we don't turn around we don't grab guns and we don't go and we don't start you know holding guns to where people can't count outside of voting centers you know i mean like we like like this is i mean i'm saying the backside of both sides are fucked up
right
right so like i'm just saying as far as us we have a responsibility we have a platform we have responsibility to to look let's okay i got we said we were in a fight like we are in a fight
ah we said what we needed to get their best time to like cape like clean slate the sea we gonna do go on board like the sea we gonna do on board
i'm gonna reserve getting angry and so the actual policies are that are unpleasant being like that
the thing is unless that happens by executive order nothing's gonna happen
ah <unk> all i think too
we've got a stalemate for through next four years
yeah cause it's it's the first time
it's gonna be it'll yeah for release
at least four years
republic no republicans are doubling and flipped the house in twenty twenty-two because that lets us be real honest about what's gonna happen even if anything biden was gonna push would have made some positive dent
he may he may ride the wave from post in a little inflate the way his numbers look the same way that trumps looked after ah obama's policies brought us out of recession let's be real about that
sustaining its important right yeah biden probably won't be able to because we know how these policies work but in twenty twenty-two he's gonna be he'll be writing that down the wave and republicans take the house
we'll see what happens i mean joe biden is a statesman he he is a weird guy <unk> people varied as r um but
he's existed in d c which is a fucking ah a <unk> nest for fifty years which is in itself impressive i think it's wrong that we have people to serve that long but it's impressive to be able to say keep your head above water for that amount time
so he's gonna adjust i think the problem is not him the problem is kamala harris
people i i i gotcha and look and all all i can look here's here's our best in my opinion ah best case scenario if biden wins is it biden lives another four years
and can state like we don't want him we don't want kamala harris gaunt being able will take our
i mean she won't what what what what even happened the senate doesn't the senate have to confirm a new v p s they probably won't even have a v p for the last two years for the economy
but what i hope is that i hope if anything if anything this next four years like <unk> said they probably won't pass much if i won't change my job we we i think we know that the man my hope for this country is is that if he does anything
that he can at least let america calm down like and so like we are so emotionally charged right now and look and i'm gonna i'm gonna put a lot that on donald trump like it he is emotionally exhausted us as a nation
that everything has to be a fight and and and and i got i got this all sides
i don't think it's all him to blame
i don't think it's all him to blame
the challenge the establishment so much they came out and said everything he does is racist or sexist or whatever
i got you but i think he but i think he could handle a little bit different
yeah but he never would have used up trump right as us know he doesn't have that in his tool box
so that's my hope is is that biden will at least at least you know take it down a notch of comic like you i mean i'm not charging of doing something dirty fighting behind could i imagine
well you can you can you can bet on right cause his statements are gonna be very limited and very short and anyways and somebody else we running the twitter fee
we imagine your household with your kids if you're fighting with your wife in front of the kids
like its tension everywhere right everybody's walk on egg shells <unk> like hopefully they can act as adults
it does put a little pressure on you particularly as a man i think
yes
but even so as a woman and and congress
senate to respond aggressively if you're spoken to aggressively cause it appears weak
or may imagine a cop walking up and saying hey <unk> what are you doing what you think you're doing like here you are not gonna consider me like oh well sir
yeah that'll be like a mind of my goddamn business
fuck you doing
ah last but not least i wanna i wanna to chat with you guys about the ah the cupboard miracle that happened today
um seven i mean just you know they couldn't they couldn't release that seven days ago on on the day after the monday after but biden and harris get elected a pfizer comes out
um which is what donald trump gave all the money too and says amen oh we haven't we've got the cure and that's we were ninety percent right now we're gonna about fifty million of those guys out out into the world in january
i to me cause dan rails on this all the time that big farmers always in bed with democrats this was a big fat fuck you from big pharma to donald trump saying ah
well he's the only one is taken on the court trying to get drug prices lowered he's only one trying to have ah these other bargaining schedules that you can buy drugs from and stuff like that he's definitely taken them on and they made him pay for ads
and he took on big tack and they made him pay for that too yeah
yeah
let's be real about this the reason donald trump didn't get reelected isn't because people don't like the way he talks right because
took her by the time
because when we come on the show and talk the way we talk we get more viewers right the more authentic we are the more viewers we get an he is there's no more authentic american donald trump let's be real for better or worse
yeah yeah i know
but he for for at least two years
they never held back
like a fucking a dude from from new york that's got a fucking attitude about him but he's also been successful off course he's gonna get an even bigger attitude blah blah blah and now is in the seventies and the billionaire how the fuck you think he's gonna act right it's it made perfect sense however
ah that all that stuff his personnel i don't i don't believe that i don't believe people voted against no trump because he's course when he speaks i think it's ah ah coordinated effort from all these very
look if if the pharmaceutical industry that's been trying to but fuck you for years and is very successful in doing so since eighty percent of all privately file <unk> are filed because on pay medical expenses
and tech companies who we know have done everything they can to go out of the way to exploit our data and sell that information off the people you think either one of those people are working for your best interest right now there's no fucking way right now
so that that's why it always brings me back to the same conclusion i am not a trump supporter however it would have been a lot better for the country had he been reelected
and for a lot of different reasons
and and i think it was one hour this let me just double down this
yeah
it was one hour after the u s stated that they had the coronavirus a vaccine that russia
they get to ninety percent of i do one hour after
um you're welcome you're welcome i have a feeling yours will be chatting about this and american party here this week ah by the way if you ah have not subscribed i go to are ah your favorites pad casting hosting sites

alright let's get to the news less than a year after the first documented coronavirus infection in the united states the food and drug administration just authorized <unk> <unk> vaccine for emergency use
and the initial <unk> have begun today marking the launch of the largest vaccination effort in american history
the doses will be distributed based on each state's adult population and the states themselves would decide who gets vaccinated first with frontline health care workers expected to be at the front of the line
the first ship of three million doses enough to <unk> one point five million people were flown out of grand rapids michigan on sunday after being transported from one of <unk> nearby facilities
here's a clip at the crowd that gathered to watch the vaccine leave the warehouse
it's just nice to see a group of people cheering science and not trying to burn scientists at the stake
that clip wasn't anything special for listeners that could have been any crowd but like it's it's not often we've been able to talk about good news here ah especially in <unk> on pod save america
so that we play that clip um love it you have any thoughts on the scope and speed of this scientific achievement and and how it came to be
yeah you know there's a i actually really really recommend there was a deep deep dive in the washington post
ah that was i think pretty fair in looking at the achievement operation warp speed trump's impact his negative impact and
ah inside of that peace and i don't wanna just make it about trump but i do think that there's something important in it because you know inside of that peace which is really about like
this is one of the greatest achievements in the history of science really is and it's born of an incredible focus over the last year it's born of decades of investment in the public sector and basic research in
in systems that try to prevent the influence of politics of you know corporate influence and interference on science that building a public health ah infrastructure of trust in institutions like all of that
but then there is this team ah ah administration official and the peace and they are quoted to saying something along the lines of in twenty years people won't remember bleach they won't remember him not wearing masks they won't remember this they'll just remember operation warp speed
ah ah administration official and the peace and they are quoted to saying something along the lines of in twenty years people won't remember bleach they won't remember him not wearing masks they won't remember this they'll just remember operation warp speed
and i saw that i was like oh oh okay i ah you know you wishing is not gonna make that happen and and what was striking to me and seeing the trucks
it was <unk> to me i was watching the videos on repeat
because what else am i gonna do ah and ah what i was thinking when i saw it is
look at this incredible achievement that like the scientists and and the government were able to do together took everything that trump paid said took ah disciplined and took belief in institutions it took not allowing political interference took public
math science
and all of those things you human ingenuity human creativity human discipline it was enough to overcome the virus and that's extraordinary but it wasn't enough to overcome trump it wasn't enough over to overcome the failure of leadership
the failure to give people resources to survive the failure to have enough mass the failure to model best practices the failure to model good behavior the failure to celebrate the people that were doing the right thing the failure to help the people that were doing the right thing
because there was no reason that this vaccine would come at a time in which the virus was completely unchecked in his country and that is trump's great failure
and it is a tribute to every single person who was involved in making this vaccine happen that they were able to overcome the absence of leadership
that ah has been basically the only consistent thing trump has offered up and until him pretending to be a leader by <unk> officials to make the vaccine rollout faster just before it is approved
so that he could claim some credit and get himself in the news cycle and ends it as it began
tell me what do you think do you think we'll still remember the bleach in twenty
the idea today that needs to be looking predictable what we will or won't remember in twenty i mean i feel like in twenty years our kids are gonna be like sway you guys could have put clean x on your face and not had three hundred thousand people died and you choose not to what's what's wrong with you like you know it's anyway
that idiot is an idiot ah any personal level i just feel like it has been like really nice for all of our mental health to wake up in and read the stories and see these photos right hannah and i cancelled our plans to see her family on thanksgiving
we're staying in l a over christmas instead of going to see my mom and my sister and my brother in boston and it sucks right any holidays or big deal to us there to everybody but you know finally there's there's light at the end of the tunnel here
and now to love its point i mean this vaccine is a miracle <unk> percent effective and created in record time i mean we are so so lucky that it is so much faster than anything in history
it is way more effective than your standard flu vaccine ah so this is a miracle and and we should be quick the pfizer vaccine was developed by a german couple
right one of them was born in turkey and <unk> to germany when he was four the other is the daughter of turkish immigrants to germany so for all the trump's credit crap ah we have germans and immigrants to thank for this pfizer vaccine
the the operation warp speed folks deserve some credit for buying a hundred million doses of the pfizer vaccine they deserve our eternal hatred and shame for passing on up to four hundred million doses at no cost to the u s i mean we could just like pay them when we got it right
but you know it's an extraordinary scientific feat ah there's some really interesting research about how in the future we might be able to speed up this process even more and we might be able to pre prepare vaccines for almost all the major known viruses out there
we could maybe create a vaccine for fifty to a hundred at the most you know serve dangerous prominent viruses for the cost of the f thirty-five fighter jet program so that seems like a a pretty good deal compared to a a plane we may or may not need to use
so lots of good news today ah you know feeling really good about this um and you know it was nice to see people feeling less scared basically
so i just remember in april when this started doctor <unk> said twelve to eighteen months for a vaccine hopefully
and there are a bunch of epidemiologists scientists and others saying that <unk> time line was way too optimistic for twelve to eighteen months eleven months that's what this vaccine hem in eleven months
ah the shortest time line previously for any vaccine ever was the <unk> vaccine which took four years that was the record and were gone from four years to eleven months and like you know tommy you just mentioned about the <unk> percent effective
f d a was ready to approve a vaccine that was over fifty percent effective know like the the number of people had expected <unk> percent effective i mean this is it a truly is a miracle
ah there were there were headlines back in the spring time like we may never get a vaccine um so no i i i had the same kind of you know hope and optimism
this section is jon basically being so mad at like a series of of articles in the atlantic they were so annoying over the course of many moves like the doom and gloom publication of choice for several months
i i i i've been i've been holding back on this
the atlantic has some like the best journalists in the world and write some of the best fucking stuff in the world but the number of <unk> that you can just google and the number of doomsday headlines that fucking publication about how we're gonna live forever with this and never go be the same is ridiculous
um but anyway
no so i was i was like i was very hopeful and optimistic too and kinda what you were saying like
like it
it really speaks to the fact that you know our world is politics we talk so much about politics we're all obsessive with politics and politics is really broken and the <unk> of politics has contributed to the death and disaster that has come from this pandemic
but other parts of society are not broken science is not broken like this this was a feat of science and just like a modern miracle that um that we should celebrate
even though you know politics failed us
every other way every other way
well i also i also just say to that like <unk> said basically that he was gonna see this vaccine to the end
and that the compromises he was making you know being inside of his administration in a week we talked a lot about people saying they were compromising you know not telling the truth about trump for their own political gains
failing to make any headway failing to actually stand up to trump of doing the morally reprehensible an easy thing but like here is this guy <unk> who i think like we will look back and say like did an extraordinary thing of serving his country
despite the the <unk> that were presented by his boss despite the incredible obstacles set up by donald trump to make sure that this came to an end and like he's a real you know he's a hero
yes so ah trump did ah publicly pressure the f d a to speed up the approval process from saturday to friday ah and his chief of staff reportedly threatened to fire f d a commissioner steven hot if that didn't happen that you can see any problems with that
i mean yeah look look for we just talk about this issue of credit for a minute because there's other debate going on too but like
when we talk about the pfizer vaccine the u s deserves credit for making advance purchase of that vaccine in july they got a hundred million doses
where i i already mentioned how angry i am that they didn't advance purchase several hundred million more doses but whatever
but the thing is incredible again about the <unk> vaccine is it that vaccine was designed january thirteenth <unk> we've had this vaccine formula in our hands for the entire year
he's a very brave chinese doctor ah sequence the genome and publicized it and though these advances in m r n a technology that none of us actually understand but it allowed us to pull this off so quickly and now the problem becomes logistics
but i mean in terms of like threatening the f d a chief i mean there's a huge problem with that i mean even the term operation warp speed is horribly problematic if you think about it from a medical point of view
we know trump wants credit for the vaccine being developed quickly but this isn't fast food like no one is really pumped about like a a rushed medical product right like no one's getting the the fastest created <unk> ever right
it's a bad idea to talk about this and into talk about it as something had happened quickly or in a rushed manner and so going even further to <unk> the approval process is a bad idea
when you've got like you know obviously there's some <unk> of the <unk> community that are kind of super aggressive and dangerous and spreading misinformation
then there's other people especially in the black community who have read about the <unk> <unk> study and have some understandable hesitation based on that history about a new drug
so this is gonna require a serious science based public awareness campaign ah and that's really important cuz there's a lot of people in this country who desperately want a vaccine but can't have it
right like if you're getting chemotherapy you can't get the vaccine if you're under sixteen as of right now you can't take the vaccine it's not clear when it's gonna be approved for pregnant women
and so if the virus is swirling around the country there is a bunch of vaccine eligible people just refused to take it that'll put others at risk
and so that's why you know that just it's horrible that we have to read these stories over and over again of of trump's <unk> the process when if he had to shut up and stepped back and let the process work things would be better
in fact pfizer didn't take operation warp speed money because they were worried that the government might slow them down
yeah i mean like trump is the worst offender here but it is going to be a major challenge to get the public communication around this correct you know even for the biden administration is gonna reproach in good faith you know
even you know the f d a approval process you know it wasn't it wasn't in a unanimous decision and some people are like why do some members of the panel vote against it well it turns out the people who vote against it were just saying oh i don't think it's ready for <unk>
two specific ages but it's like that's the kind of thing that you actually need to make sure you communicate clearly to people cuz if you just see a number oh some people vote against you think it's dangerous it's not it's just they had a problem with the ages so far you know
so there is gonna be like there is no such thing as too much ah public communication around this vaccination effort and it really has to be consistent and done very well
well i mean look i there's something such a to me was such like a signal example of what trump has done throughout this period because yeah he was complaining that oh they held back the saying that the vaccine work
because they didn't want to help me in my election right that was just in the ah in the past couple weeks but this was like
did he knew the approval was gonna happen it had nothing to do with him he wasn't gonna speed it up he wasn't really gonna slow it down the vaccine was gonna be delivered on monday
so he like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to achieve some <unk> results so that he could look like a t v president
ah the other piece of this too is there's a lot of stuff that should have been happened that hasn't happened right like
there should be a public campaign going on right now that doesn't exist about how the <unk> gonna be distributed where it's gonna go like there's all the aspects of presidential leadership that has just been completely missing right
like it's why there aren't enough <unk> mask right now why there's there there may be supply problems down the line with a vaccine and it's wide right now we don't know how people will get it
we don't know where it's gonna go we don't know the process because there's been no public education and some of this hasn't even been fully thought of
pods of america is brought you by <unk> some ideas for jokes at <unk> not being able to sleep because today's politics pandemics your love life any other drama you talk about in your show what other drama do we talk about
you're just doing so much love and that you can't get to sleep
ah what what about this era has a ah oh yeah i can't get to sleep because of my love life
i'm just so fulfilled that can't sleep
<unk> sleep has a quiz it takes just two minutes to complete and match your body type and sleep preferences to the perfect mattress for you
why would you buy a mattress for someone else with <unk> you're getting a mattress that you know will be perfect for the way that you sleep everybody's unique and <unk> knows that so they have several different mattress models to choose from
they have soft medium and for mattresses mattress is great for cooling you down if you sleep hot
we've all been there i i sleep hot personally ah huh it's nice to be cooled down and even he looks plus mattress for plus size <unk>
i ah i sent the <unk> mattress to ah to my in-laws and they cannot stop talking about how great it is ah my father-in-law had some had some back issues and now he is just sleeping well
thing now they're like the grandparents from <unk> they just stay in their all day
i know you have a problem with grandpa charlie love it
yeah the grandpa joe

trump administration officials have said they hope to <unk> up to twenty-four million americans by mid january ah and joe biden has set a goal of a hundred million vaccinations within his first hundred days which brings us to the end of april
what are some of the bigger challenges in getting every american <unk> as quickly as possible you know we've already covered sort of the demand side of it which is making sure that enough people want it and trust it but what are some of the other other issues involved in this tommy
i i mean i think it's this is now just a massive logistical issue you know when you think about a hundred million two hundred million five hundred million doses if everybody needs two of them all of those doses need to be contained in a little <unk>
and they all need to be manufactured and they all need to be shipped somewhere and they all need to be <unk> out by states that are really short on cash and so it really is like thank god joe biden and his team is coming in and it really is just about competency
and so that's where you know again i feel a little hope more hopeful i mean i feel hopeful in a lot of ways with joe biden than trump but it's something we should all feel hopeful about and maybe we should speed up these timelines
i guess something i don't understand and i'm look i'm totally out of my depth here is why the u s government isn't using the defense production act to maybe aid in manufacturing or distribution of of the of the vaccine
i'm not saying that they should do it trump seems to be attempting to do with his executive order which is you know use the d p a or use the government to say hey pfizer all your doses are for us they're not for other countries like that's immoral
and it's not feasible because they manufacture a lot of these doses outside the country too but like at a minimum we could use a d p a to ramp up production of p p e
or we could use military assets to to ship some of these vaccines especially the ones that need to be stored at super cold temperatures we could ramp up the availability and frequency of testing
ah to do a better job of identifying outbreaks and i do think like the thing we are just talking about was the broken messaging and and clarity about what's gonna happen and what's gonna expect um and and the biden team will fix that
along those lines i mean i think one of the best things that you know the media could do is commit to not reporting on or amplifying trump's covid related lies or misinformation
starting the day he leaves office you know what i mean he is like the biggest problem in terms of vaccine hesitation right now and we should all agree that we are moving on from this asshole if you're not you know a fox news host
i sort of get the sense that the d p a is like and it's tough to figure this out now because we saw the trump administration here and we don't know what the biden administration's gonna do but it's almost like a last resort thing that you use
if all of the different private companies aren't cooperating and doing what you want them to do fast enough and of course it's like there's a whole supply chain issue right so they supply the vaccine
but there's glass <unk> <unk> needles cooling systems ultra cold <unk> g p s thermal sensors i mean if you read some of the stories about what they have to do to vaccine around it's incredible and it's like so much more than just needing enough actual vaccine
so the coordination and and logistics are just like mind <unk> also delivering them right like you need how the the the first batch of vaccines are going to hospitals that can handle <unk> storage which is not every hospital
trucks that can <unk> cold storage which is certainly not every truck
and then you have the issue where it's like gonna be harder to reach rural and underserved areas that just don't have the right healthcare capacity how do you get it to them when you don't have the right trucks and hospitals there like it is a it's a biden administration has quite a challenge
we need the <unk> approval to come through cuz that could be stored at more regular temperatures and that will i think help
for sure
and i i do sort of wish <unk> <unk> hadn't just told doctors to kind of you know give give people two or three fingers worth you know what i mean
two fingers for most people three fingers if you are like if you you know really thirsty for the vaccine
because not great not great i wonder what's going on with johnson and johnson come on johnson and johnson but
tell me you ah tell me you said this a couple times so we really should hit on it like this fucking the fact that the trump administration could have bought four hundred million more doses from pfizer
habit knows of the new york times story a couple of weeks ago have the chance in july and that i didn't realize until i saw scott <unk> the former f d a commissioner was on ah c n b c this morning saying
is or as late as november this november the trump administration had another chance to buy another <unk> million doses and didn't and we still don't know why like they keep looking for like
or we just is this hyperbole are we like not no no ah there's no explanation anywhere as far as i can tell of why they passed up in november the chance to buy another <unk> million doses
i get that they're <unk> their bets and buying from a bunch of companies but again like
right
ah in the grand scheme of things first of all i think we had to make the payment upon receipt of the doses of we didn't get them from pfizer would have to pay the money but in the grand scheme a thing spending another eight billion dollars on vaccine doses is nothing
nothing compared to the cost in lives in our economy and and everything else it is it is baffling and it is absolutely mind <unk> it is baffling i don't get how this happened the this is a a fuck up of just epic proportion
and i don't mean hopefully will figure out who did it i bet the e-mail just like <unk> in <unk> and box of one of his you know his college roommates ah you know told him not to do or something
yeah i i've been looking to it there's really is you can't find any plausible explanation because it was not the money was no risk there is no risk adjustment was like ink if it worked
if it worked
and it's like i was like are they were they were they worried about getting the super cold version where they were also counting on <unk> <unk> johnson and johnson or any explanations over there's been no explanation once
it's none
it's crazy you touch on this but you know experts say that it's gonna cost about eight billion dollars for the states to distribute all this and it's not just it's distribution it's storing the vaccine hiring medical workers running public awareness campaigns federal government picks up some of the tab but a lot of this is on the states
and of course states don't have any money left because of this recession and there had been begging for local and state aid for months that mitch mcconnell is holding up single <unk> ah is on fact is holding up the entire covid relief bill over this
because he doesn't want states to get a penny of additional money ah it's it does seem to me like democrats just hammer this issue relentlessly and like turn the state local aid issue into an issue about vaccine distribution to states
yeah i mean just before we were recording it look like some of the negotiators were putting out can have two versions right they were gonna put out the version of the bill that was just the relief portion and they were gonna separate out
the state aid and the liability portion
cuz they probably know that that's not gonna pass and they're like i will just fucking set that loose
well it it does seem like if we if we really are separating out liability and state and local aid it does seem to doom liability protections in state and local aid because mitch mcconnell won't budge on state on state local aid or democrats obviously don't want liability protections
i don't care what what that negotiation looks like ah it's it's a maddening thing you know i talked to <unk> about it in love it or leave it and it really is
it's it's worth remembering this is taking a really important part of protecting people and helping people during this crisis and adding a completely unrelated thing of proof of <unk> corporations
ah which does nothing to help us get out of this crisis ah but it does seem as though separating those things out makes both impotent far less likely to happen while making you know direct payments may be more plausible i i don't know
i just the one of the things that drives me the most insane about washington is that it's all about expectations management when in terms of press coverage rights so like the worst you are as a human being
the the more terrible you are consistently the less likely you are to like get hammered over an issue like this and and when it comes to mitch mcconnell he has spent months refusing to engage with democrats over covid relief period right like and now he wants to punish states
because their finances have been decimated by <unk> that were made necessary by a federal response that was absolutely miserable and again like love image is his top priority is liability protection for businesses
what like mitch mcconnell has blood on his hands people are waiting for hours in food lines because of mitch mcconnell right like states have to decide who gets this vaccine first they have to distribute it they have to do all these logistics and need preventing them from getting that money
right now mitch mcconnell is blocking a bipartisan bill to prevent patients ah who have insurance from getting surprise medical bills for unexpected out of network or emergency care why
is he cares more about private equity backed insurance company profits than regular people mcconnell is one of the worst people in political life and political history he is disgusting he's a corporate <unk> he's cynical
and like the coverage of him in how he acts is is talked about as sort of savvy or tough and impressive the reality is he's a monster he's a monster he's a bad legislator all he does is block shit everything they do is via some
you get punished for trying you know what i mean it's like everyone's hammering pelosi online for engaging or not engaging fucking tweeting pictures of the amount of ice cream she has in her freezer like mitch mcconnell is the clear enemy he has been all along
but this is this surprises me not just like you and you know why mitch mcconnell's gonna get his way on this and that this deal is probably gonna pass with all of the shit that he wants or doesn't want it is because he's got the fucking numbers and he's got donald trump in the white house like i thought you know
bernie sanders said with that the deal is bad we shouldn't support the deal and like i i agree with them in the sense that the deal is fucking bad the bipartisan compromise is bad
now that they've separated state local aid and liability protections was left over is even more inadequate than the bipartisan compromise it's it's shit for sure but like
what's the what's the choice here like you're gonna you're not gonna negotiate a better package with these republicans who you're gonna get to vote for more money you're gonna get susan collins and mitt romney to vote for more money and lisa <unk> no they said this is the best that they would do
and if you don't take the deal and we don't win georgia we're not gonna get a better deal when joe biden's president and joe biden's not gonna have a mechanism to force a better deal because mitch mcconnell's gonna sit there and say fuck you i have the numbers i don't have to pass a deal
if they really do pull out state and local aid and they pull out the liability protections which obviously none of us think should be part of this at all makes no sense ah and they have said from the beginning they won't do a trillion dollar keep in mind democrats are to come down from
to two trillion to <unk> now we're trying to get to one i i what i don't know is what happens if they replace the state and local aid as it was drafted with direct payments does that become something that gets people like bernie back on board
i don't know maybe maybe you try that i mean bernie is one thing but like like josh holly or some of these republicans who want direct payments yeah i would i would try to get as much in there as i could you know and i will try to push more direct payments for sure but like at the end of the day
i would also take whatever is left because something is better than nothing for people who are struggling even though it's not much
i mean look congress doesn't do anything well anymore what they do is they jam every bill they're ever supposed to pass together in what's called an omnibus and the deadline for that bill which is currently i think one point four trillion with a t dollars is friday
or else the government shuts down they're gonna try to jam whatever like covid relief measures they can into that and that's kinda like the best and only shot we're gonna have until february march i don't know
i also what i was going to say is yeah that that's exactly right until like this
if there is gonna be something close to a trillion dollar relief bill it will be inadequate it will be terribly inadequate and people will be suffering next year
and if what you're doing is replacing state and local aid with direct payments to people you are ah ah you are kind of changing where that <unk> where that pain will be felt
and basically what you're saying is next year you want states and localities to be put in an incredibly difficult positions right as hopefully we're emerging from this to cut transportation cut schools cut public health
cut the police something republicans ah seem to believe ah is something that they oppose ah ah and every other local service so it really is like
because we are talking talking about a completely inadequate stimulus no matter what happens we are really just talking about who who do we want to unnecessarily subject to pain
you want an adequate stimulus vote for two democrats in georgia that's how we're gonna get adequate stimulus
yeah that's it other big news today is that it's the day assigned by the u s constitution for each state's <unk> to gather and cast their official ballots for president based on the winner of the popular vote in that state
as the founders intended
as it literally
you gather and hide
with police protection yeah exactly sorry sorry sorry i am on um i'm woo i'm too hot today
it is a day that it's the day that usually passes off without much <unk> except for this year when donald trump and most republican politicians in congress have so far refused to accept the results of a presidential election for the first time in american history
even though their false conspiracies about voter fraud have essentially been unanimously rejected by election officials and judges from across the political spectrum liberal and conservative democrat and republican
the latest and likely last legal challenge to <unk> every ballot cast in four <unk> states was rejected by the u s supreme court only two justices clarence thomas and samuel alito believe the court was obligated to hear such a case
but even they refused to hear this particular pile of steaming garbage they were like yeah basically these kind of cases i don't know if we can show them to open but this case yeah no no definitely this case
um so on one hand we have a complete rejection by the supreme court the comes after <unk> other <unk> by judges appointed by democratic and republican presidents including trump
on the other we have seventeen state attorneys general and a hundred and <unk> republican members of the house of representatives that is more than half the republican caucus
including minority leader kevin mccarthy who wants to be fucking speaker the house in two years um all these people publicly supported an attempt to overturn the results of the election publicly supported and lent their names to
ah what do you guys take away from that tommy
i i mean i take away that the republican party is no longer a party it's a cult and and the cult leader is about to be out of office but he is still mixing up a a big <unk> of <unk> ah and he has not loosened his grip on these people at all
right it doesn't matter how irrational the demand is it doesn't matter that the demands are illegal the <unk> cult does not believe in democracy they believe in trump
and you know i just people love to both sides and <unk> partisanship like we should just be clear this very new thing like the democratic party was supportive of obama
but if he had said ah falsely that the b p oil spill was fixed whenever one was watching oil <unk> out of it on live t v zero democrats would have fallen in line behind him right
but like trump's covid denial is worse than that this this electoral fiction he's <unk> is worse than that and so at it's a very scary thing
ah i would like to believe that will be destructive for the republican party and then maybe democrats can win but the odds are that twenty twenty-two is gonna be brutal be as redistricting and so we shouldn't count on it
i don't i don't know the way around it like i i hope that people will get tired of his <unk> but that was my hope in twenty fifteen and then sixteen and then you know the republican primary happened and obviously that didn't happen
i hate to say guys oh well one obvious thing that would be helpful is winning these georgia run <unk> but then you know i hate to say it but it would it would also help i think if brian kemp ah survived his primary challenge
that's gonna come i mean that we need some <unk> republicans to start winning so that they're all not living in fear of a primary challenge from a trump backed candidate otherwise the guys just gonna hold a grip on the party
a grip on fox news a grip on <unk> and it's we're stuck in the cycle and i think we have to beat them all i mean at all i just i like there's no i look i know how hard the house is gonna be in twenty twenty-two i don't know if everyone realizes this but um it's gonna it was gonna be hard no matter what now with redistricting it's gonna be even harder
but like i don't see an option besides winning the house or holding the house in twenty twenty-two
because if like you know i've been saying that a lot of the concern over donald trump's successfully <unk> this election um is is a little <unk>
because we have democrats in all the right positions because we control the house of representatives because we controlled the <unk> in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania like that's the only reason that i felt safe
and and and saying that joe biden is gonna be president if we have a republican house in twenty twenty-four not only do i think they'll have impeached joe biden by then they'll just make up some reasons to do that
but then in the twenty twenty-four election if the if the republican candidate or if trump pulls what trump pulled again it goes to congress and now you have a republican house
and do we really think the republican house is going to ah play by the rules after what happened this time i don't think so
yeah i think we should not confuse the fact that this coup will fail and that it's <unk> are silly and <unk> from how dangerous this moment is i don't think i think that that sort of trivial i think we all get that
but then i do think and then they're just promising okay with what we do what we know what we need to do we need to win elections alright and the problem is we just ran ah a a a national election
in which we won we won up by four point five percent of the vote by giving the way where our voters are ah giving some of the hair inherent <unk> aspects of the senate
it was not enough to to win the to win the senate and we still managed to lose some house seats and those fundamental problems are not going anywhere we're not abolishing the electoral college
ah in the next four years we're not getting rid of the senate we're we're we're gonna have some really bad redistricting ah that's gonna hurt us ah because we did so poorly ah in legislatures
and so to me like i do think we have to split these things into a kind of two big difficult conversations one is how do we win inside of democracy and the other is how do we preserve democracy and fight for it against a party that has abandoned
i no longer am interested in stories about how republicans behind the scenes say they don't really mean it no you do mean it this is it i thought you know you're not in private saying that you don't support what you support
actually in private you're pretending to hold a set of beliefs that nothing in your politics nothing in your public statements ah ah is true you're pretending to not believe it while everything you do ah ah separates democracy you know
ted cruz is not putting on a show ted cruz is doing what he thinks is in his best interest he's not doing it he's not going above and beyond he's not saying he wants to argue before the supreme court because he's afraid of trump he's he's chosen aside he's seen where his people as go are going so that he can lead them
what they learned from trump is that shame is not a useful attribute to have in politics so they are all shame you cannot shame these people all we do is a oh all these republicans gonna learn better we're just gonna put pressure on them
we're not putting any pressure on them they don't pressure is not gonna change their behavior shame is not gonna change their behavior anymore they have to be beaten that's what gonna like i i know it we you know we we did win this time and he tried to steal it but it was enough
it was a big enough margin that he was not able to steal it and which the only thing we can do in the future is to beat these people and like you said like we were not gonna eliminate the electoral college before then before we beat them we're not gonna fix <unk> before we beat them
we're not gonna fix the senate before we beat them all roads lead back to beating them in elections there's nothing else
yeah and i would say to like the next ah the con the conversation we should have is obviously not about shame but i i do think we should be talking i did is a much longer term challenge than even what will have to do <unk> to keep the house and to keep the white house
and it is like all right they're shameless they're mercenaries they're doing what they think is in their interest ah we need to talk about the fact that they don't view defending democracy is in their interest right that that propaganda has so thoroughly taken hold right
like when you say like they don't respond to shame like what does that mean it means that like virtue integrity these qualities no longer matter in our politics being honest ah caring about the basic civic ideas that are the bedrock of our country they are not important anymore
which tells us something which is like like it or not <unk> our institutions may have been just strong enough to get us through this
right but like this <unk> way of thinking like it's taken hold of a lot of people it's taken hold of a lot of people in this country and it's really really dangerous and we have to talk about those incentives and those levers because this will get worse unless we start looking up river
when we start looking at propaganda what facebook is doing what fox news is doing and actually having conversations about how we we combat it how we don't just lamented but we actually combat it

so there is there is one more play they're gonna try here ah lost all their legal challenges couldn't pressure any republican election officials to illegally refuse certification the results couldn't find any republican state legislatures to illegally send their own slate of <unk>
so now the look in a january sixth which is when the electoral votes are officially <unk> in congress and read aloud by none other than the vice president mike pence so that's fun
the here's the rules if a member of the house and the senator together both raise an objection to a slate of <unk> both houses of congress have to vote on whether to reject or accept the objection
of course already a few house republicans no surprise there they're all fucking <unk> and a few senators like ron johnson of wisconsin have said they may object
like this is it's not gonna work because democrats have a majority in the house and will vote down the objection and there are now enough senators in the senate who have said joe biden as president of republican senators
that there's also a pro democracy majority in the senate so it's not gonna work but it is interesting to me that it's now going to put every single republican member of the house in the senate on record
as whether you are for or against the coup attendance so the ones who are trying to hide like marco <unk> by <unk> the hand waving thing they'd be like forget about the coup thing it's the left wing outrage that's a problem
for a a left wing outrage about the coup that's the real problem
i'm not taking this beyond twitter i've said what i have to say on twitter i'm not gonna bring it to our podcasts still did not look did not couple democrats object bush vigour and they couldn't find a democratic senator to do any kind of went by the way
yeah in <unk> four they did with kerry in ohio too but like this is madness
it'll go nowhere it'll go nowhere and this time they'll have a senator but they'll still go nowhere
this is drink the <unk> this is their moment all of them will be on record oh should we call it the the coup
led with a with a p that worked
thanks guys i don't know if it's a good or a bad thing to have all these guys on the record
as four against the coup attempt i'd like to think it's a good thing maybe we can hold that against them in elections i don't know any more i don't know any more it's like that
i think we're gonna be sad i think it's gonna be a sad moment
every trump thing starts as like <unk> but then like he just goes all in on every maddening insane right wing like conspiracy theory that he did he <unk> onto and here we are i don't know
it's like when you say something ironically and then all is something just something you say you know what i mean
all of a sudden you are typing l o l
i think it's gonna be a really sad moment because like one of the institutions that have stood up really well during the coup attempt is the judiciary and we've seen you know liberal judges conservative judges trump judges all throw out these challenge
but at the end of the day selecting a president comes down to congress and you're right like we're gonna get a bunch of republican house members who object who cares about them they may they may get ron johnson or ted cruz or rand paul
or one of the buck nuts in the senate to join them and then both houses are going to have to vote which means that in the future if they do this it's not gonna matter what the courts do
if the courts throw them out because it'll ultimately come down to the january six moment in congress and what if you have a majority in congress one of these days it says yeah we're gonna throw out some we're gonna throw out some <unk> and and and and overturn the results that's all it takes that's all it takes it's just congress doing that
bit by bit
ah let's talk about so the damage that the coup attempt is already doing beyond our republican politicians the texas republican party responded to the supreme court decision by calling for secession
ah that's that's true that actually happened alex jones said that joe biden quote will be removed one way or another
sydney powell a former member of trump's legal team joined other <unk> <unk> in calling on the president to suspend the electoral college and set up military <unk>
ah many of these <unk> descended on washington over the weekend where right wing <unk> groups like the proud boys attacked police counter protesters and <unk> two historic black churches four people were stabbed and twenty-three arrested like where do we go from here
and these these these are fascist these people are <unk> and these are their brown shirts and their storming around through washington and it is incredibly scary and unsettling ah and where we go from here feels uncertain to me
i hope we can get through inauguration and like joe biden will be in office and maybe these people can <unk> at the back but i do think think it's gonna it's gonna take a conscious choice for all of us the media politicians to stop covering donald trump
like he's the national narrator of all u s events we cannot center this man in our politics for four more years
and and and rid ourselves of like the cancer of of this <unk> fascist mindset you know like we have to try to move on from him somehow we have to get serious and actually focus on things that matter
or otherwise we're gonna be back here in four years and he's gonna be the g o p nominee and god knows what will happen
it was such a split screen moment for me over the weekend in just preparing for today's pod is on one hand you have the vaccine development and distribution and it's this it's this example of the entire world working together scientists health care workers
truckers politicians get real like everyone coming together to do something good and try to get people vaccinated and then you have the fucking <unk> descending on washington just trying to burn everything down just trying to burn it all down
like these people are awful just awful
yeah and and i do think we need to stop trying to convince ourselves that because they're silly because they write things on their butts ah because sydney powell is a is a is a bad lawyer because rudy giuliani's face melted
like we need to stop taking comfort in the fact that they're silly because um ah like every dangerous violent <unk> <unk> movement is silly in some sense
if they weren't dumb if they weren't <unk> they wouldn't support that movement and so like we should just keep in mind that some of the most dangerous and reactionary forces that have had a huge impact on this country
that have pulled this country backwards in our history were ah were were no weren't genius there were no they they they didn't have to be because when you employ violence when you introduce the <unk> of violence across our politics
it can work things and change things without you having to be very sophisticated and i just think that require i i i don't know what to do with that information i don't it's but it's just something we all should keep in mind
and like don't take comfort in their stupidity <unk> we just can't
yeah it is a it's still an open question of how big their numbers are and and and part of this is making sure the numbers don't get bigger you're not gonna do anything about the <unk> who descended on dc but there's other people who could fall into that kind of trap you know
anyone will avoid that i'm mean like there's a new c b s poll out over the weekend you know that it gives the usual numbers only eighteen percent trump voters think biden the legitimately won the election <unk> percent think trump should refuse to concede even if the electoral college votes for biden which they will
and seventy-five percent think republicans in congress should try to keep in trump in power but then i saw the endless question was forty percent of trump voters believe that if biden is the president
that um trump and his supporters should work together with biden on making progress which is surprised me because the same people who think they're the elections are not legitimate you know that sixty percent of them think never work with biden on anything so that's still a majority
but that forty percent might be where you began you know like because the only option we have at this point
what i also just think it's interesting too it's important too because what it does also show you is that these are in some sense performative reactions even to <unk> we're all pundits now we're all on a team
and like that's a good thing in the sense that people are saying things they don't totally mean it's a dangerous thing in which believes themselves are now at how you demonstrate your <unk> which means nobody is gonna be telling the truth
and you know like i so i'm gonna i'm gonna do it ah <unk> the quote which i think about all the time these days is you know you are what you pretend to be so be careful what you pretend to be yeah it doesn't matter
the difference what people say and what they think is it doesn't really matter because what people say and what they perform is what ah becomes our politics
i'm gonna i'm gonna follow suit here so i was reading obama's book and then i start reading ah like an old book i found from college from <unk> <unk> who is a playwright writer thinker political leader in the czech republic
and he talks about how every country every culture every like society has the sort of polls right there's always sort of a <unk> camp and there's always a more hopeful camp and it is up to the leaders to decide which one of those you awaken
and trump has spent four to six years awakening the scary <unk> ah right wing camp and the next republican like ronald reagan was awful he did <unk> damage to this country
but he didn't do that and and we we barely survived that and the next set of republican leaders better be pretty goddamn careful
ah about whether or not they decide to <unk> those <unk> forces cuz right now those people were you know they were in d c over the weekend saying chanting destroy the g o p cause they won't go along with the coup attempt so yeah that shit will bite you back
they were all like you know you talk about future republican presidents but it's also this is this was part of joe biden's message in the campaign and talking about what you want to project to the country in what kind of a country that you want to have you know like
and do i ah have a lot of optimism that joe biden mitch mcconnell are gonna sit down and hammer out some deals together no i don't but i think biden's message was bigger than i am going to work with republicans in congress it's about you know a battle for the soul of the country in healing the nation
and i think projecting that image to the country it matters
and oh by the way lets add to the list ah as he projects that vision to the country he also perhaps without a senate hopefully with the senate that's incredibly divided regardless
he has to deliver and that's like the single most important thing he can do to save the country which is deliver
hundred percent

you ready to start
i'm ready to start
you sitting down
yeah
okay your eyes closed
<unk> anything you see whether some feelings that's what we're looking for okay
this is a therapist named <unk> in session with a patient named ted
what are you feeling can you describe it like it's happening right now right now
the session was recorded as a part of an educational psychotherapy video series in the session <unk> is helping ted relive a memory the time his <unk> father-in-law was rude to his wife
yeah and he is all dressed up
hi jennie yeah oh there he is hold on
and there is yeah there is a formal thing is like you know good to see we have to it's like to me and we talk to each other our voices drop yeah
hi how are you yes yes
<unk> eyes are shut tight his method is try to weld himself into the patient's skin to feel what the patient is feeling
i can do this better than you watch me
okay okay okay
i'm gonna put my arms around you i'm gonna bring you kind of close
i'm into better than you huh
yeah that good
<unk> does voices in <unk> and at times the session feels like <unk> grand improv
that son of a
it's playful and honestly kind of bizarre but the point of it all is to help the patient rehearse behavior in the office that he can then apply in real life
touch her touch her
oh
yeah hold her
so much
by the end of the session <unk> has turned ted a meek <unk> patient into someone capable of expressing himself emotionally
gonna be this way with jennie cuz you've <unk>
we got it huh
i'm ready
we have this ability within us to become a whole new person
<unk> died in <unk> but this is howard a psychotherapist and one of <unk> disciples howard runs <unk> website and publishes his books
are are you talking a little <unk> when you say a whole new person
no it he is that's radical job then it's to become a whole new person the term is used as an optimal person and discover that within yourself
according to <unk> once you've discovered this optimal personhood you can shake off what others want and live on your own terms
it changed my life direction
and for these kinds of radical results <unk> was given a lifetime achievement award from the american psychological association
one psychology text book even goes so far as to describe <unk> as being quote as important as freud
but this isn't a story about <unk> professional life his life inside the office this is a story about <unk> real life
he insisted i ran away
this is rachel <unk> daughter
and i i did
how old were you
i was in grade five
the year was <unk> <unk> and rachel's mom had been locked in an ugly custody battle for eight years
rachel's mom was poor and struggled with depression rachel really wanted to live with her dad so when <unk> suggested she ran away from judy and denver to his house in ohio rachel didn't pack a bag she didn't say goodbye to anyone
she just left
like he set up this whole thing with his lawyer and i just felt like i needed to do what my dad and the lawyer told me and this was the right thing i think i said it was going to the library and
somehow i don't remember how i got to the <unk> office and then they took me to the airport and put me on the plane and i left
<unk> had gotten <unk> to a woman with two kids and rachel loved feeling like she was a part of this happy family there were dogs to play with and bikes to ride and yet this other feeling would often creep in
i miss my mom i miss my friends i miss my cat but i could never ever ever say that out loud to anybody
and there was someone else rachel missed missed most of all
she told us she was going to the library and then she never came back
this is rachel's brother john he's two and a half years younger than rachel and only has flashes of early childhood memory about <unk>
he recalls doing <unk> things that would make perfect sense if the son was an adult things like lifting weights together and smoking
he was a pipe smoker he bought me my own little <unk> pipe and you know as a four-year-old he actually had me smoking you know tobacco in the pipe with him
it was as though <unk> couldn't distinguish between adults and children which was why he saw john's closeness with his mom not as a child's natural maternal attachment but rather as a personal slight
and so <unk> never ask john to run away john was left behind in denver with judy
i think in his mind i just you know was more a <unk> boy and a chip off <unk> block and i think he's sort of gave up on me and he he was really focused on rachel
and as the final custody hearing approached <unk> focus on rachel intensified he wanted to prove to the court that rachel was better off him so he had about a half dozen social workers and psychologists offer assessments
rachel was interviewed and <unk> new family observed none of the experts spoke to judy and the plan worked
in the autumn of <unk> a judge ruled that rachel would be allowed to stay in ohio with al for good but john would remain in denver with judy
and we never live together again
when you have a sibling who is just a critical part of your family and then you're separated from them its a wound
how uncommon was something was an arrangement like
extreme yeah very very uncommon kids are not split up
we each grew up alone i missed her through my whole childhood i missed her a lot
i mean we were we were so close when we were young and you know she was the big sister who threw all of that was looking out for me
growing up from then on just me and my mom grew up as an only child and my mom just always being in pain and
she never was able to enjoy whatever it is we were doing at the moment it was always always oh if only rachel were here we could all be together and i'd be saying but but we're here now
when he turn thirteen john invited rachel to his bar <unk> but <unk> wouldn't let her go rachel sent a poem instead
it had to do with the rubber band stretching across the distance and connecting us
for john not only did he lose his big sister he also lost his dad year after year john tried to re-enter <unk> life but each time he reached out <unk> rebuked him
one time as an adolescent john tried scheduling a visit
then he said well as long as you guys you know me and my mom required any money any child support there'd be no visit
and i said well it sounds like you care more about money than about me and he said well i don't want it to just sound like that that's how it is
nevertheless a few years later john asked once again if he could come visit by this point rachel was eighteen and no longer living with <unk>
so when <unk> refused john yet again rachel told her brother to come visit her instead they hadn't seen each other in eight years were she the same sister that you remembered
um no i mean i knew her as a you know
yeah six seven eight nine <unk> next time i saw her she was an adult
in the year since that visit rachel and john have made a point of staying in each other's lives they talk on the phone celebrate holidays together and once a year their families all take a trip but the childhood together that's been lost
i mean my daughter certainly watches us and thinks that we're more like cousins ah she can see that the disconnect cause we did not grow up together
john and rachel still have questions about their childhood but now that their parents are both dead they have no one to ask so they parse through their separate memories trying to construct a timeline comparing moments of overlap and filling in the blanks
to this end one night while john was visiting rachel for thanksgiving he asked if they could go through <unk> files
<unk> was an obsessive record keeper and after he died rachel inherited his papers she never really gone through them keeping them stored away in a filing cabinet but that night she pulled them out
and together john and rachel made a series of disturbing discoveries the first of which was the script
the script for me was like oh my god
the script was a lengthy <unk> written by <unk> from the point of view of the child rachel's point of view
in it <unk> refers to himself as daddy judy as mother or judy or simply she i later asked rachel to read some over the phone
two and a half pages long and small psychologist writing okay so here i go with in my good happy dreams custody is changed and i live with daddy
if i am forced to go back and live with mother it will only be till the day i'm fourteen which apparently was when you could decide
um when i'm with her i feel scared that i might get tight and angry and cold like judy she is not a mother she is a keeper she makes me feel like i'm in a prison i can't let her touch me
it was like finding a childhood internal monologue committed to paper and written in your father's handwriting rachel didn't remember seeing the script as a kid but she remembered saying those things and she remembered thinking them
in one of <unk> many books a volume entitled the manual of optimal behavior he writes that the behavior can be <unk> and modified quote until you are ready and eager to go ahead and do what you've <unk> and modified
unannounced to her <unk> was having rachel rehearse and modify
it was so
explicit if there was nothing subtle about it you know the whole thing was sick
the second thing discovered among the files was a letter from rachel to her mom in it she begs judy to let her live with <unk> but there were two copies one written in rachel's hand and one written in <unk>
going through the papers rachel remembered other things how <unk> encouraged her not to smile when she was with her mom saying if someone photographed her happy it could be used as evidence against him in court
in every photo from that period with her mother rachel is wearing a frown
that's when i started questioning and started to realize that i was coached to brainwashed
it made sense for most of her adult life rachel had had no memory of loving her mom it was only after her mother's death when she found mother's day and birthday cards she'd written to judy when she was very small
that rachel realized she had i love you mommy she'd written i love you so much but with else constant coaching it had all been stamped out
the final thing john and rachel found that night were those psychological reports <unk> had rachel submit to just before the final custody hearing in them you see <unk> <unk> bear out
one report notes that rachel kept repeating quote i want to live with my father he loves me my mother doesn't love me the report notes that she said this with quote grim determination
they also uncovered one particular report that night that was longer than any of the others it was the only one that evaluated both john and rachel and in this it carried the most weight
and what shocked john and rachel most of all
my dad clearly edited edited it and then she <unk> it with the edits and submitted that rewrite
is that ethical as a social worker
oh no no no no no no it's not no oh no no no no one would should ever let anybody else especially their client edit their reports no it's it's really bad
the report was written by a social worker named joyce
<unk> said it's the <unk> report made the language more emphatic for example where joyce had written that rachel was hesitant when it came to judy <unk> changed it to say she was fearful in another spot
he added that rachel wanted to blot out any memory of ever having been away from him
honestly i mean it was horrifying you know just to see the detailed notes to see the edited drafts the cross outs in his handwriting
um and then the final version that was submitted to the courts with his edits in there like there's no question and what happened
the report concludes with a recommendation the strongest one of any report and the only recommendation of its kind
she recommended that i live with him and that my brother live with my mom
john and rachel separation came down to a decision dictated by <unk> and signed off on by joyce
how is <unk> able to exert this kind of power over a social worker someone who's supposed to be an impartial outsider john and rachel couldn't understand it
but that night when rachel googled joyce she was shocked to realize that joyce hadn't been an impartial outsider at all joyce was a family friend
rachel recognized joyce as the kind dark <unk> woman whose house she visited as a child
rachel would bring her cello over to play music with joyce and her family which means that on top of everything else wrong with the report joyce should have never been the person to write it in the first place
she was like the one person in my life as a kid who could have said hey i think you are coaching her and this isn't right
why are we gonna trying to put these kids up she was the one who could have said something
in nineteen seventy joyce recommended that my sister go with my father and that i go with my mother and that's what happened
and that dictated the course of my life what happened
this is the question that's been nagging at john and rachel's since they found the report how could this have happened and so john and rachel want to find joyce and ask her
but i don't fully understand though is what i have to offer rachel and john are both practicing therapist themselves they're more than capable of posing difficult questions
and although i play a mental health <unk> <unk> on a podcast i'm not actually one at all what what can i do
well ah so i have had to advocate for myself my entire life from a very young age and nobody advocated for me or my brother
and so if you could help me with this it would be a healing piece for me that somebody else advocated for me
after the break in search of joyce

i'm gonna put my arms around you i'm too better than you huh
yeah yeah
now it feels as though <unk> is <unk> the outcome
if you wanna cry go ahead go ahead it's okay go on
at one point <unk> tells ted to cry
ted it's okay go ahead cry go on that's alright
ted is not anywhere close to crying
ted you're starting to cry go ahead let yourself let yourself go on it's alright go on do it
ted is not starting to cry but <unk> insists
ted you're on the verge of crying
now cry go ahead
and then a tear appears in the corner of <unk> eye it rolls down his cheek it's as though <unk> has conjured it into being to share force of his own will
good for you good for you great great okay now
the video is a part of the series produced by the american psychological association intended to showcase prestigious psychologists in session the way the series works is that for privacy reasons the patients are portrayed by actors
as the credits rolled i've learnt that wow <unk> the therapist is <unk> the therapist ted the patient is actually bob the actor
it was a quick shoot there wasn't a rehearsal per say we just kinda went in and and improvised
this is bob and performance wise bob has done it all
<unk> swords cracked whips eaten fire i've done for ten years i did stage hypnosis show
bob is a regular renaissance man in that he also worked at a renaissance fare when bob showed up to film that day he was asked to improvise some sort of marital problems that <unk> could help solve by bringing his method to bare
i asked bob if he found <unk> behavior <unk> but bob doesn't recall much there is one thing though that bob does still recall even thirteen years later it seems bob wasn't <unk> first choice of patient
he had had someone else do it before i think it was an african american lady and that didn't go the way it needed to do you know what i mean
um can can can can you elaborate
he showed it to me briefly
bob describes the video <unk> showed him before they started filming that day in it the set-up was the same as it was for bob's shoot <unk> was in an armchair his legs up in an ottoman except this time
in the armchair beside him was the actress like bob the actress in the video had been asked to come up with a marriage problem but in doing so the actress went to a darker place and <unk> anticipated describing a husband who is vicious and cruel
nonetheless <unk> tried to offer counsel
he was saying things like when he behaves in this way can you be playful about it and the actress said things like when he calls me names suggesting that he might be in so much borderline of rarely ah verbally abusive
it seems there was the way the actress was given to talking about an abusive relationship and then there was the way that <unk> preferred her to talk about one and so the actress was replaced and bob was shown a video to illustrate what <unk> did not want
it's if you know i i i get the message i guess
still not having received a response from joyce i decided to mail a letter and just a few days later i found an e-mail in my inbox in it joyce tells me she is not sure how much help she can be
she reminds me that it has been fifty years but she says she is willing to try she concludes the e-mail by saying please feel free to contact me if you wish joyce
hello
hello
i think your sister is here too
hello hello
the last time john and rachel saw joyce they were children
they're now in their <unk> and sixties because of the pandemic the meeting between rachel john and joyce will have to take place over zoom john and rachel join first from their respective homes
so how how are you guys feeling today
ah quite anxious actually what about you brother john
i'm more nervous than i thought i would be
john is seated in a chair his posture upright rachel's sitting back on a couch
go ahead and talk a little bit what did you have for breakfast
i had yogurt and <unk> yeah
me too
i can see the joyce is in the zoom waiting room waiting
back in my day a waiting room had all kinds of stuff to keep you occupied like lukewarm water you could drink from a paper cup or twenty year old copy of vogue but now waiting rooms are so metaphysical there's nothing to do in them
i suggest we let joyce in
okay
yeah okay okay huh yeah let's let's do it
joyce appears on the screen wearing a bright blue sweater and a colorful <unk> that gives you the effect of a fun grandmother standing beside joyce is a middle-aged man who i assume is her son he's helping her get set up
hello
oh hello
joyce and her son frown at the computer it seems they're having sounds issues there's a long moment in which we all look at each other in silence and then
joyce settles into an armchair
ah well ah do do you all look familiar to each other
no ah well it's been a long time i'm rachel hi joyce
hi rachel
hi i'm john
you're john
so ah joyce do do you ah i know john and rachel are curious about just how much you remember maybe maybe ah
virtually nothing
so i wasn't clear what what i can do for you i'm certainly willing to try
so i think what we're remembering from that time or what we know is that my dad and my mom were in a very i don't know if you remember bitter custody battle
and um there were so many court battles
and um one of the reports was done by by you so we wanted to talk to you about that and find out what you remembered about that
joyce <unk> through clenched teeth shakes her head
ah i really don't know what happened um
we wanna ah we think our father it looks kind of everybody he met in a very <unk> way
yes i would certainly agree with that
you know say now was <unk> is an understatement
<unk> husband at the time was a colleague of <unk> that's how she first came to know <unk> he and her husband both taught in the local university psychology department joyce says her husband would always come home with al stories
acting out at meetings um and ah shouting out inappropriate stuff so um he was very very controlling he he took control of any situation any social situation
one party at my house he was a guest along with the other members of the psych department and he just could took control of the whole evening
and of course the more people drank the more intense it got i think the focus was on people's dreams and dream analysis
for <unk> a <unk> this meant exploring each party <unk> dream for hidden sexual desires that he <unk> could then expound upon in a roomful of colleagues
joyce relates the anecdote to illustrate the kind of guy <unk> was but john hears something else in the story
so you all <unk>
john is trying to remind joyce that she was <unk> friend that writing the report wasn't appropriate but the implication goes over <unk> head
the department wasn't a big one um and it was close knit and and ah everybody got together they you know
friday what do you do you hang out with the people that you know best and that was in the department um
what kinds of questions did you have ah that i can help with or that might get the answer or speculate about
you don't remember um evaluating us you don't remember having that roll
no
i guess i am curious if you remember um because i would have said also if like i wanna live with my dad and i love living here but i was coached
like don't smile if someone takes a picture of you with your mother
oh rachel oh rachel
did could you see that at all
no i i this is all news to me
did you do other custody evaluations was that a part of your practice
um that may have been one of the first ones and it was at his request that i i did that initially
it was at <unk> request you're saying
oh yeah yeah
do you remember any thoughts or feelings that
you know maybe it's not appropriate for me to evaluate someone that i socialize
no no not really because this was in the beginning of our arrival and so we weren't really socializing at that point
and at that point joyce and her husband had just arrived in town while her husband taught at the university joyce did not she hoped to some day but she was still fairly young
and at the time the only women in the psyche department were grad students and secretaries so when <unk> this larger than like figure came asking for a favor it felt hard to say no
he was chair of that program
and you know i was i was new in town um i'm a people <unk>
so i think that that added to my my vulnerability to al
well i wanna make sure of that you know that um
your report recommends that we're split up
joyce takes off her glasses she places them in her lap
oh wow
i am sorry
i'm i never
would've done something like that
and hearing that i did i makes makes me feel terrible
so that's that's a surprise to you
it's total surprise and it's totally
against everything i believe
it's horrifying i i don't know what prompted it or what precipitated it
i i don't know
i'm sorry
but of course there is more
you know we can see al crossing out words and phrases
that you wrote and then <unk> them in stronger language
and then it's that stronger language that's in the final report
i'm appalled by that um
i hate to keep repeating myself but i'm truly sorry that that happened and had terrible consequences
i have a <unk> i feel terrible that it turned out that way i feel awful but i had a part in that
or that i am perceived to have had what i did i mean i can't say i didn't if i wrote it
this is something joyce does a few times she'll start to say something like if i did this but then she'll correct herself rachel has the report standing by to hold to the camera so joyce can see it for herself see her own signature
but that never becomes necessary even though she doesn't remember joyce believes john and rachel and so she doesn't cop out or <unk>
if i if i did something like that or because i did something like that
i am so sorry you guys there is anything i can do to mitigate in some small way
and it means a lot that you say that
oh yeah yeah
and it it it it's not just words it's it's it's heartfelt it's really heartfelt
and do do you have any idea why he why he might have turned to you
well to control the outcome i think
um
he was more comfortable with women because he could push them around
did you feel used
by him
well i guess he was using me so yeah
joyce says the relationship with <unk> was short-lived the end came soon after joyce invited <unk> and a few of her psychologist friends to join her private practice they accepted and all began working out at her office
and we did that for a while and then they decided that it wasn't appropriate to have a social worker in their practice so um they asked me to leave
and it was at <unk> <unk> <unk> um
what he said to me was it's not that you're incompetent
it's just that i don't know that you're competent
and you know for me to remember this fifty years later says a lot doesn't it
so this was him kicking you out of the practice
my my
my practice
your practice
i remember you like very very very fondly
well you're you're kind you're kind you're kind
you're a nice lady you are a good person and i see that now too i mean i had every reason to feel that way
rachel will later tell me that because of the way her dad brainwashed her she often can't trust her memories so it feels good that her memory of joyce is correct joyce is nice but rachel is nice too and can sense how badly <unk> feeling
you know i think my dad was so controlling
and i have to think that my dad coerced you and really pressured you to do that
thank you
you know hopefully you can tell rachel and i are are okay
we're really good parents we're close to our children we did not replicate any of this
now that's wonderful i'm so glad to hear that
and i've been with my wife <unk> years and thankfully now you know rachel and i came back together on her own and i'm very close with my sister
oh i'm so glad i'm so glad
damage done to us can often become damaged we do to others and on it goes but watching john and rachel i'm struck by the way they're breaking that cycle not just in their lives but right here in the room
well the zoom room
just to be clear joyce um i really appreciate what you're saying and
really really important to me that others just own and acknowledge their role in in any any dynamic
and in any interaction if they do that i'm good and al never
i tried in different ways
he would never owned any <unk> responsibility anything
when john first became a psychologist he'd see <unk> at various conferences where <unk> was received as a star
for john it always occasioned a weird mix of pride in his father's career and bitterness over his personal rejection
at one conference john attended <unk> lecture in the hope of forcing his father to talk to him
<unk> saw john and the audience but afterwards made him wait on line along with all his adoring fans eventually john grew frustrated and left
it's one of the mysteries of my life how he justified or <unk> to himself you know having a son and and supposedly loving him
and then just cutting him off and rejecting him for the rest of your life i don't i can't fathom that at all
there was a um an e-mail exchange over seven or eight months where i endeavored to answer that question that lifelong question of you know why
and he just kept trying to sell me his books and you know became this refrain have you read my book have you read my book and i'd say if you would like me to read your book
send me a copy and i will read it no he wants me to buy a book he wanted me to buy a book
in his <unk> the john <unk> wrote that it was a <unk> myth that a parents should seek relationships with one's child i do not accept silly pop psychology <unk> he wrote
in the end of <unk> life john wanted to make one last effort to see his father so <unk> could meet his grandkids
but rachel <unk> john not to go she said that <unk> would refuse to see him and was still so full of anger that he might even call the police
after his death <unk> left behind a will with the section listing the names of those who wronged him each person was to receive a single dollar among them was john
back when i spoke to <unk> disciple howard he told me that al was <unk> at the end of his life yet he was still focused on his therapeutic method
just before he passed away ah when i visited him he said howard i'm working on becoming more of an optimal person i'm just doing it now and he was like so energetic
and and do you do you
from your perspective i mean did he achieve that kind of like an optimal personhood
he said he had
when i raised the subject of <unk> relationship with his kids in how that connected to his optimal self howard says he can't really speak to that <unk> didn't bring up his kids much
there is a lot of stuff that goes on sometimes good and bad and you know that's just what happens in life ah we live and we adjust and do what we have to do
but i don't think whatever happens at a certain point in someone's life should define them for who they are as a person overall
ah can you come back in a little bit honey
a little girl barges into <unk> room she is wearing a lacy blue dress that's either a night gown or a <unk> costume
i'll be with you in a little bit thank you
that's my <unk> granddaughter
oh she is cute very cute
we're sheltering in a place together
yeah that's nice
nice
i'm very lucky
joyce i'm so appreciative
thank you
yeah thank you
one can believe one is optimal just as one can believe one is fluent in french a talented singer a good therapist but the only way to really know is to one's relationship with others the ones who love us who guide us
who let us know when we wander or stray for some realizing your optimal self does not occur in spite of other people but because of them
my son is getting married in the backyard i'm looking at it in a few weeks
thank you it'll be a very small ah socially distanced

i am great meg thanks so much for having me this is so fun
i was just telling you before we started recording that even as i was putting together kind of like an outline some ideas for our conversation i was getting so excited
because i know that anybody can fill us in especially those of us who maybe haven't had the best year of books and reading can fill us in on some things that we might have missed
it is you you read so much you know so much about not just the reading side of things but now about the author and publishing side of things so i was getting so excited i can't wait for our talk today
me too i had so much fun looking through my list what i read this year to figure out what i was gonna bring so
yes we have so much ground to cover with books before we get to that tell us a little bit about what life looks like for you right now you know your are in awesome
so you are part of our community lots of people and triggered recognize your name but tell us a little bit about what is going on for you right now
so my husband and i live in north texas and he is working full time he works for the electric companies though he'd never got to stay home he had to go all the time
and i have a seven year old in first grade and three year about to be four year old and i just decided to home school them this year i have an education background i taught fourth grade for seven eight years and so
i just decided you know what i can't deal with the anxiety of the school's going back and forth and why not so i decided to home school so we're trying now for the first time this year which is interesting
other than that i do a lot of reading and i do a lot of writing and we're just kind of going with the flow of life
i am with you on going with the flow all of my kids are in seems like are doing different things
our oldest two are still enrolled in their regular school and they're doing all virtual they got to go back on campus
we try to open schools at <unk> city they got to go back for two days two single days
we had to close down again the twins meanwhile who are in second grade i had pulled them out at the beginning of the year some like you with the younger kids i just didn't want to do the back and forth back and forth
so i also am <unk> for the first time and it is an experience
but i think that you captured it perfectly with just like we gotta go with the flow so that's what we're doing
okay well you guys truly katie has picked out some very fun look that i want to tell you before we get our conversation later in the episode
whether you are a prolific reader and reading is your passion is your hobby and you've read a lot this year or truly like me you guys the main reason they went at this conversation with katie is because honestly
this is one of my worst years of reading ever i mean i know a lot of us maybe in that boat
he just has not been something i've been able to carve out time for this year in the midst of you know all of the other craziness
so katie has fixed some really cool things and so whether you are a prolific reader or viewer like me and you've been in a little bit of a slump i promise you katie has something on her list that you are going to love so we're gonna get to all that
and just a few minutes but katie let's go ahead and start the show the way we always do with our awesome of the week
if you're noticed what an awesome awesome of the week is the moment in the show where we like to stop talk whatever is awesome in life right now whether it's a book or t v shows sometimes it's a movie or a podcast or product
whatever bring a little joy that we need so much right now to our lives katie i can't wait to hear what you brought us the week
okay so mine is a beauty product and it's a all bright c <unk> so the vitamin c serum from beauty counter it is the most <unk> little yellow bottle that you've seen
and the liquid that comes out is actually yellow because it has some heroic in it and so how does it really like nice earthy kind of smell but it's a vitamin c serum it goes just on after you plant <unk>
and i swear this makes my face look instantly better like your skin goes from like boring to like bright and pretty in thirty seconds so it's my favorite product of all times right now
i will just testify so we're <unk> so i can see your beautiful face and you definitely do have a lovely glow about you so yeah i really testify that the stuff must work
if the great it's my favorite thing so far this year so
also i want to tell you guys too that katie liked had the bottle and she was showing it to me and i'm like oh that is a pretty yellow bottle i think i need to check this out
i'm sure you like me i mean i collect all kinds of <unk> and as what's gotten colder even in part the country where you and i live which is not like freezing but it's you know it's cold and dry air for us
i'm like where is the <unk> please i need all the <unk> right now everything is dry so okay tell us the name of the product one more time
so it's a beauty counter all bright c serum
okay perfect
beauty counter is technically an m l m company but i don't think you have to use a consultant so you can just order straight from their website and i will say it is a little <unk> but you don't need much like i've had this bottle for probably six months
and i still have a good little bit left so it's just my favorite
i have noticed that with vitamin c <unk> to a little goes a long way for sure so we will have a link to <unk> awesome in the show notes for you guys
okay my awesome of the week is seasonal i had something totally picked out that i was gonna talk about amnesty that for another day because just recently a brand new christmas album dropped because you guys know we don't have enough christmas albums in the world right
but the one that just drop that i'm so excited about is from dolly <unk>
oh i love her
yes have you okay first of all katie did you listen to cause i know you listen a lot podcasts too did you listen to dolly <unk> america
which is the sort of like stand alone series that came out maybe last year i can't remember when that came out
i didn't but i just listened to her talk to bernie brown
yes i've been hearing so many good things about that interviews so i'm gonna put a link to both dolly <unk> america and to that bernie brown interview in the show notes for you guys to check out
i think growing up in oklahoma no katie i'm a little bit older than you so going back a decade or so growing up in oklahoma in the eighties and the nineties
dolly <unk> was such a <unk> figure i feel like there's never been a time in my life and i didn't know who dolly was
so her music is really you know it's part of my childhood part of growing up years dolly <unk> america is a fantastic podcast that i thought i love dolly before i listen to that
oh my gosh it and <unk> who this woman is how she came up in the industry the total feminist icon that she is that i never knew all these years you know underneath all the hair
and the costumes in her huge personality she has been so scrappy she's so smart as a business woman
she is amazing exactly like i feel like all of us know that but i cannot say it out
okay so here she is she's <unk> years old traps a new album with a lot of original music on it
it's called a holly dolly christmas and it is so great so she has recorded a few on here that are just like your standard christmas music
she's got holly dolly christmas on here she also has you know like i saw mommy kissing santa claus she has mary did you know
this is in classics but then she does have original music that she has just written and recorded again the woman is in her seventies and still is making this incredible music
and the funding is is that she has a lot of <unk> on here as well so she's got a duet with like michael boo play which that's really expected for you know a christmas album
but did you expect <unk> cyrus to be on a christmas album
no that's interesting
yeah it really is and she also has another duet with <unk> cyrus billy ray on here
so it's really great you guys it's on spider fights on apple music amazon music all the places you listen to music you can find a holly dolly christmas i encourage you to look for the bonus version
because she just dropped a special bonus track that she performs live recently on her holly dolly christmas t v special
the song is called i still believe i am might start crying thinking about as she wrote it just for twenty twenty it's a true like
oh my gosh we're gonna make it through this together but i mean it's dolly singing but also she has a gospel choir backing her up it is so good
so again that's on the bonus version of this album it's the sort of secret bonus track that she dropped it's really great katie i gotta tell you i think if you like dolly even if you don't you just want some fresh new christmas music in your life i think you'll like it so
that sounds so good i'm gonna go look for that

okay <unk> i have told you before i will say it again one of the most life changing discoveries that we made this year is <unk>
use this thing so much it's perfect for easing the tension of every day life which let's face it twenty twenty is nothing if not packed with tension
plus during our big ice storm earlier this fall kyle hurt his back i was able to use the <unk> to help him find relief and it's saved us hundreds of dollars and visits to a doctor's office
we are convinced that the <unk> is actually magic and what it actually is is a handheld <unk> therapy device that releases your deepest muscle tension
using a scientifically <unk> combination of depth speed and power and now it's as quiet as an electric <unk>
that's because the all new gen fourth <unk> has a proprietary <unk> motor that so quiet you are gonna wonder if it's even on
while you soothe your aching muscles with <unk> signature power amplitude <unk> shoulder <unk> back massage hips lower legs anything that is aching that's hurting that's causing you pain
<unk> can probably help you find some relief and now you can try <unk> for thirty days there is no substitute for the <unk> gen four with an o l e d screen
personalized <unk> up and the quiet and power that you need it started only one hundred and <unk> dollars so you can go to <unk> dot com slash awesome right now and get your gen forth <unk> today

all right katie i hope you're ready for me to just basically put the microphone in your hands and lead us through
what we're gonna talk about and just a little bit like i said katie did publish her first book this year it's a middle grade novel we are gonna talk all about that here in just a few minutes
so i definitely want you guys to stick around for that part the conversation i cannot wake katie for us to talk about what that has been like releasing a book in the year twenty twenty i'm sure that has been an experience too
but i thought you know what let's talk about what we might have missed in books and reading this year but i wanted to kind of break it down into categories
because we have thousands and thousands and thousands of women who listened every week so of course in a group that big there's gonna be you know certain kinds of readers so i thought okay let's think about like what are some of the categories of readers
because i know if i tell you a category i know i can count on katie to pick out a book for that readers so i picked out seven categories
i'm gonna throw the category at you you tell us what you think would be a good breed that something that you've picked up recently and speaking of picking it up recently
i thought the first category that would be fun would be like the buzz book reader this is the reader who loves to be in the loop on the books that everybody is talking about whether you hang out and like a facebook group is devoted to reading or you just like to have you know
i was gonna say at dinner parties whatever those were
if you dislike to chat with people about what you've been reading and you like a good book that everybody's been talking about katie what are some good picks for our readers who love buzz books
okay so the first one that came to mind for this category i just read in september i think and it is called the invisible life of <unk> <unk>
i had that go ahead sorry i got so excited that interrupted you already okay go ahead yes
the author is v e <unk> this book has been everywhere it was a book of the month pick that's how i got it the cover is gorgeous in the black it's got these gold letters it's just beautiful
okay yes i have to tell you i got it as my book of the month pick and i have yet to open at katie sell me on this book
so basic set up is adam <unk> she lives in the seventeen hundreds she's in a french village outside the city with her parents she basically makes a deal with the devil
who she calls the darkness to get her out of this kind of sticky situation but the catch is that she will live basically forever and free
but that any time someone sees her once they turned their back on her they totally forget she ever exist
so this story bounces back and forth between the seventeen hundred and then two thousand fourteen where somebody remembers her for the first time in her three hundred years of life
so that for our story bounces off from there and i just loved it the writing is absolutely gorgeous the experiences that she has i'm sure you can imagine they make for some really interesting you know meetings with people
they forget her immediately and so i just really loved that there's a lot of art and literature and writing kind of built into the story to that just i loved it
okay i feel so proud of myself that even in a year when i'm not connected to reading i actually picked a look that everyone is talking about so there you go maybe over the christmas break will have a little time to finally crack it open and read it
yes i've heard the audio is very good too that is not how i read it but i've heard that it is very good on audio as well so
perfectly perfect okay did you have any other picks for the buzz
one more and this was one of the ones that was up for best book of the year on good reads and this is called the girl with a <unk> voice by <unk> dare
it's also got a gorgeous cover this is a debut novel which i was like shocked for reading and because it's so good but this book follows a <unk> <unk> and she is a <unk> girl
living also unlike the countryside and her father sells her into basically a marriage into this man's third wife and all she wants to do in her life is learn and read and be not somebody's wife or mother and so
the something kind of tragic happens in their household that forces her to leave where she is and she goes to the city to work to basically be an <unk> servant for this other kind of a wealthy family
and so that's all i want a fake i don't want to spoil it but it is so good her english is a little rough in the beginning like you can see the transformation of her as she learns more which is great
but it does take a little bit getting used to that kind of dialect in the beginning but i didn't have too much of a problem with it i've also heard that truly good on audio if you want to listen to that
okay tell me the name of it one more time
it's called the girl with the <unk> voice by <unk> dare
okay those both sounds so good and yeah i love hearing those picks that it's like these are the books that all of the readers who are in the know this is what everybody is talking about
so i think i might actually maybe be like a secret
okay so the second category that i thought may be fun is something i think a lot of our awesome kid maybe relate to you and this is the stuck in a slump reader
this is a reader who usually does love to read but twenty twenty has just like <unk> their energy and it has <unk> the fun out of readings
so i'm wondering if you have a <unk> or two for people who again they're usually readers but this year they just kinda got stuck in a little bit of a slump when my snap us out of a slump
so when anybody asks me when they're gonna reading some what they should do i usually say two things i say pick a favorite reread which i can't bring to the show because i don't know all these people and what they want to reread
or i say pick a really sweet middle grade book and i know middle grade isn't for everybody but i feel like middle grade books are just so hopeful and sweet usually
and they're really easy to read like they're really fast so you can get through a story pretty quickly so i'm gonna tell about one middle grade book that i loved and then i'm also just gonna throw in another fine adult book just for in case we have middle grade for people who don't love middle grade
but one of my favorite middle grade books this year was called the lonely heart of <unk> lane by kate <unk> this was also a debut novel
<unk> is eleven and she is estranged from her father whose like a radio d j and she wants nothing more than to meet him and kind of have him know who she is
her mom leaves her with this neighbor woman while she goes to search for a job it's like over the summer and this neighbor actually happens to be one of her teachers from school
and so she kind of like kind this neighbor lady to take her to a singing contest where her father will be so that she can meet her dad
and then another boy from her school kind of accidentally tags along so they go on this road trip
they have these experiences that kind of one of those like make your own family kind of situations which i love a book about like ah come <unk> family
yeah
that one was very sweet i loved that one
you know before you tell us your next pick i have to say and we'll talk about this when we when to get to your book that i love a middle grade novel and i think i really fell in love with them not even necessarily when i was in those middle grade
although it did certainly a lot of reading at the time but when i was working on my as of yet incomplete masters in libraries
like decades ago but i took a couple of young adult literature classes and so here i was as a young adult it was in my early twenties and i was assigned these middle grade novels and oh my goodness you are so right they are usually so engaging
so enchanting that action picks up from the beginning again because if you're thinking about a classical in a middle grade actual reader you gotta grab that attention right away and so there's not a lot of like
story set up and you know it really gets you right into the action at that is a perfect pick for if you're in a reading slump and you just want to pick up a book and just take off with it
i love that so i am a huge fan of the middle grade and again we'll talk a little bit more about that here in just a few minutes so what's another pick for the stuck in a slump reader
okay so this one is called the house in the <unk> sea by t j <unk> you've probably seen this cover all over the place too because it's been very popular this year
but it starts off with this man named <unk> baker and he works for a government agency and he gets sent on this kind of special assignment to this island there's an orphanage on an island
and there these kids and they all have these weird magical abilities so and they're not things that you're necessarily familiar with and one of the kids just its kind of a scary situation so he's a little bit nervous
he takes this cat with them he goes to this island and he stays at the orphanage and he supposed to be like sending reports back to the government agency about the orphanage and the man who runs the orphanage
but i picked this one for in a slump reader because it's just the sweetest most fun little fantasy book that it's just felt like i was getting a hug from this guy while i was reading this book so i loved it
tell me the name of that again
the house in the <unk> sea by t j <unk>
gosh what a gorgeous title that is too
yes
i loved that booth if you are stuck in a slump picks are feel good books because i do think sometimes especially if you find yourself is like an energy victim of twenty twenty like it's just as after energy
you may have some trepidation about starting a bit because like nobody wants more you know like hard stuff right now i got hard lives are hard enough as it is
but a feel good but i think you're right it can kind of unlock that oh my gosh now i remember why i love reading moment for people so
so great okay so here's another category to throw at us what would you recommend for the serious literature reader
the people who when they walk into a bookstore they head straight for that literary fiction shelf like serious reading katie what do you have for us
okay so my favorite one this year hands down was called the book of <unk> by sue monk kidd
and this one can be a little controversial because it follows the life of anna who is the fictional wife of jesus
did you tell me about this
i thought i know somebody told me to read this book this year and it was you okay yeah
and so we start off meeting anna she is kind of put into a precarious social situation that makes her kind of <unk> but jesus marries her
and so we get to see her life as his wife and she doesn't really talk too much about jesus as god like his divinity it's more about his humanity peace
and so to get to see that side of how she kind of interpreted how jesus the man would be with his wife and then she's also a writer which is why i love this book so much she has this really cool bowl
that she writes prayers inn and her dad gets her <unk> know she wants to write the stories of women that are forgotten basically so she has a collection of stories about women
so it kind of just follows her life throughout and i just loved it i thought it was so beautifully done and i just i just loved it
while sue monk kidd course you know like just such a treasure of
contemporary american literature so i can only imagine i remember you highly recommended this to me i've had other people say have you read the book is the book of <unk>
okay
the book of <unk>
yes i just have heard a lot of people like people appointed me in that direction so i feel like yes the stars are aligning for me to pick that went up
will say if anybody's uncomfortable with maybe like the content of this to there's a great authors note in the back where she kind of explains how she did it
katie <unk> i'm currently reading is the reason i read this book in the first place and she's the one who suggested read the author's note first to see if that's gonna kind of make you feel <unk> about it like faith wise but i didn't have any issue with it and i ended up really loving
good good good stuff okay any other literary fiction picks
okay so i also loved this tender land by william kent <unk> this was technically published last year but i read at this year some an accountant i think it was kind of later in the year
so this was kind of like an odyssey <unk> like odyssey meets huck <unk> if you will
interesting i like that
the main character is <unk> and his brother they are at one of those native american boarding schools they are not native american i don't remember how they ended up there but they are at the school
they have a good friend and then there's another little girl and something happens that makes them have to leave their school and so they are on this journey to search for <unk> and his brothers aunt who is in a different city
and they like take off down the river in a canoe and they meet all these different kinds of people and have all these experiences and i just really loved the scenery was gorgeous the story telling was gorgeous
it's not one of those like <unk> family kind of stories and i just really loved it so
okay that sounds so fascinating what a great context for a story to start again alike that
and <unk> too as you're listening don't worry about shutting any of these down we will put a full list in the show notes with links and also these categories
so if one of these stood out to you and you're like oh wait i'm most serious literature reader than you could go like right to the listed fight them with katie has picked for you so
okay so this is so great i have a few more categories the next one is this one i'm super personally invested and because this is totally mean delighted by non fiction reader
if i am reading a lot during the year i'm almost always reading a lot of nonfiction so we're talking memoir or biography i love essay collections
anything where its just really beautiful to read and it's also a non fiction i mean i also love my share of self help books as well
for those of us who get into the nonfiction every year katie what are your picks in that realm
okay so one of the best ones i read this year was called after the last <unk> two families and the story of refuge in america by jessica <unk>
this one is incredible she's a journalist and writer who works closely with refugees that live in austin texas and she worked really closely with these two women
the first one is named <unk> <unk> and she's from myanmar and her family came with her to austin that was in the early two thousands and then <unk> came from syria with her family
more recently and so she tells these stories of these women kind of in a chronological order of where they were or how they came to get here what happened to their families along the way
and then she <unk> it with more informational chapters about the u s immigration and refugee policy which i found very interesting as i don't feel like i knew a lot about this
that's one of those topics that people like to talk about but i don't know that they know much about it so i really appreciated it read like a novel for me yeah i could not wait to sit down again and pick up these women's stories
you know their resilience and their courage and i just thought it was really good i want everyone to read it
i have had that on my list since the first day i've heard about it before it actually published obviously refugee issues and refugee policy in america is close my heart we did a whole episode on that way back at the beginning of twenty seventeen
when i was just researching for that episode which we had to do a really quick turnaround from that i learned so much was like oh my gosh i had no idea about any of this and
so i have had this book on my list for so long i'm so glad you brought it up because i absolutely want to dig into that when very soon after the last <unk> so
another one for nonfiction and this one is a little bit lighter it's not have information heavy but this one's called the native and it's by <unk> b <unk>
and she is a christian woman and she's also a member of the <unk> nation and she kind of just has a lot of reflections on her christian faith and how that <unk> with her native roots
and getting back to those you know stories and just her heritage and then how that kind of affects her christian faith as she goes through it i loved everything she talked about she talked about the church she talked about racial issues in the church and
you know inclusion and white supremacy and also just like her love for jesus and her love for nature and all the things and i really liked that one too
yes oh my goodness that sounds so intriguing to me and again of course growing up in oklahoma
there's this really strong intersection ah you know like a sort of standard american culture then also living side by side with the native american culture in the different nations that
we were moved to oklahoma like i just have the sort of familiarity with it but not enough to like really have done like a deep dive into how that all fits together with christianity especially christianity in america so
that sounds fantastic i love that
yeah it was really good i listened on audio and she reads it so it's really nice to hear her voice you know tell you her story and i really like that
yeah fantastic next category and stick a little bit of a turn into something a little <unk> may be because category number five i thought be fun to talk about the beach reader
since most of us missed our summer vacations this year and that might be when we pick up a lighter read to check out may be take to the beach or wherever we're traveling
katie what are some of those more like <unk> reads that we missed out on this year
okay so i don't read a ton in this category but my first one is called beach read by emily henry and this one the title the little misleading cause it actually takes place at a lake but
the set up is that january is a romance writer she's in a writing slump she goes to stay at her father's lake house after he dies and then next door is actually her college writing author nemesis named gus
and he's also having some riders blocks so they kind of make this bet that she's gonna write like the next american novel he's gonna ride a <unk> com and they're gonna like flip back and forth and share notes and you know
it's cute and fine and sexy but there's also like a depth to it i don't love like just the flat because there is some grief and there are some <unk> betrayal and some kind of things that go into it
ah give it a little bit more like depth to the cute fun romance part so i really liked that one i thought it was fun
yes beach read is one that i actually did read this yeah and it is so good it's just what you exactly said it's so fun i flicked the dialogue in the back and forth between january and gus it's like so snappy and so good
so funny but you're absolutely right there is so much depth to each their <unk> with their working through with their processing highly recommend that when i think emily henry is a great writer so yeah i love that one
okay another one that i like this year is called the happy ever after <unk> by abby jimenez this one it's like a companion novel to her first one which i don't remember the title now but you don't have to read the first one so you can pick this one up by itself
so sloan is our main character she's an artist her life is kind of fallen apart and this dog likes and jumps into her car one day and she has to figure out whose dog this is and what's going on
and so she finds the owner of the dog and he's actually overseas for the next couple of months so she agrees to take care of the dog they communicate first like on text
and then she finds out who this guy is and he's pretty famous and so she's like i'm talking to famous <unk> carers dog
and so their relationship kind of starts over text and they meet and you know et cetera et cetera so i thought this one is really fun it's really easy to read there's lots of fun music
yes
so cute and fun and sexy
i mean if you are gonna give me a meet cute that involves a dog in your telling me music is <unk> in the story i'm like wow sounds like a book written for me so i could definitely pick that up too
okay next category is the expand my views reader so this is the reader who loves to read about experiences of other people
kind of outside their own context with their outside of maybe their religious beliefs or their cultural background
the reader who really takes up the promise that reading gives us that you can learn about like anything anything in the world you can learn people's perspectives you can learn about people's experiences
if you'd give it a chance when you're reading so what are some expand my views picks that you might have first katie
okay so the first one i want to highlight is called sitting pretty the view from my ordinary resilient disabled body by <unk> <unk>
she is on instagram at sitting pretty and i love her instagram profile and all of her content so she's in this is kind of like a memoir essay collection
about a woman who's been in a wheelchair most of her life so she talks about things like dating
and working and her family life and how she was treated as a child and how people treat her in public and what happens when people try to help her too much when she doesn't want help
so she brings up a lot of important issues about abel of them and how she feels and her body she's really funny and gracious and i just really like that
i did this when on audio which she also reads and so just having that experience of her telling you about her life this is a really really good one
okay yes i have seen her instagram account before and i know that it has really
resonated with so many people i mean talk about expanding your views and help you to understand somebody else's perspective that's different from your own and so i bet that that is absolutely an incredible rate
and then i also for this category wanted to make sure that i talk about cast by isabel <unk> this is one you probably seen everywhere to it's a big but isabel <unk> is probably one of most brilliant women i've ever read in my life
she took ten years to research and write this book
wow oh my gosh okay
and her basic premise is that the way the united states has separated itself out by race she calls it a caste system and she kind of comparisons to india's caste system and also nazi germany is caste system
she brings him similarities and also differences between the two and then she talks about the history of racism in the united states and how it has evolved from slavery to mass incarceration and now to where we are with all of the issues
surrounding race in the country now so i really loved reading that even that was really hard i read it with a buddy which was good because we had to kind of process after each day
but its very readable it's not like a textbook she writes in a really like narrative the kind of way she tells all the stories of people you've never heard about like why haven't i heard this before
and so i just really liked that when i thought it was a very like mind opening kind of book so i wanted to
what a perfect to pick up in twenty twenty as this has come to the surface nationally and collectively for us again that's a great pick for this year for sure
so okay last category before i'm really turned them over to you to talk about your book and your publishing journey but before we do that i wanna talk about the reluctant reader now
a lot of us are parents maybe are more familiar with this phrase because maybe we have children who are reluctant readers they can't read but they just there really resistant to it
hey some of us that is still the case in adulthood some of us would maybe rather just turn on netflix and see what is on instead of reading i am wondering if you have a few <unk> for a reader that they could just pick up and not be able to put down
sure so when i was teaching fourth grade when i had reluctant readers might go to the winds like to hand him a graphic novel because graphic novels are so fine and i really love them as an adult too i love to look through the pictures and read the story
so my favorite graphic novel of this year is called when stars are scattered and it's written by omar <unk> and victoria <unk> it's a true story of omar and his brother hassan and they live in a refugee camp in kenya
and so it kind of tells you about their overall like daily life and then their process of going through the u n and then coming to america
but his brother is a person with disabilities and so he feels like he has to just take care of his brother all the time
and so it's a very sweet story about brothers it's very informative about refugees and that you know kind of the things that they have to go through and then it's really hopeful
cause it's middle grade and you have to be hopeful on middle grade so i loved it the illustrations are in the story are just so compelling i sat down and read the entire thing and it was so good
sounds fantastic i love it i love it
okay but if graphic novels aren't her thing something that i love to do when i'm feeling a little bit like i wanna read i pick up a why a fantasy because why fantasies are so fun and they usually have a series to go with them and you can read like five in a row
this one only has two and it's not necessarily a fantasy but it's an alternate history that the first one is called dread nation and the author is justina ireland
so the alternate histories that the civil war had to pause because zombies yes zombies were taking over
and so they took all these former slaves and children and put them in these training schools to basically kill the zombies that's their new job
so we have jane <unk> is our main character she is <unk> and spicy and strong she's just like one of those character he wanna be friends with because she's great
she and others from her training school gets sent to this settlement out west and its kind of like a creepy like situation they get there and there like that things are not all as they seem here
and so the adventure kind of takes off from there now if you had asked me before reading as if i liked zombie books i would have said no
but i listen to this on audio and bonnie <unk> reads it and she's like the queen of audio books in my opinion i love her
and i just got pulled in right away listen to the second one as soon as i could get my hands on it the sequel is just as good and it came out this year and that once called the <unk> divide
and so there's tons of action tons of zombies you know there are some friendships situations and <unk> it was really fun and i was surprised that i liked it but i really really loved it so
i mean isn't that just like the magic of books that a book exists that imagines a world
where's the civil war and also zombie
i love it that's incredible what a great pick that is and i think you're so right too i do a lot a lot a lot of reading via audio book
not all that but a lot and so you know anyone that is like ah i don't know if i wanna read but you are still doing your daily walks with your dog
or you're trying to get on the treadmill every now and again like any time when you have a little space you can fill it in with audio after you listen to <unk> awesome you could put on an audio book and get some reading done
i don't think enough people put an emphasis in their lives that on the fact that you can totally read books via audio that's a very legitimate way to read so
well and i was like very anti audio book until the middle of last year because i hadn't really tried one i was like listen i'm gonna get bored like i'm gonna not focus again it was katie
as currently reading he was like i'm sad for you that you don't like audiobooks i was like fine i'll try one and i have probably listened to more audio books this year than i have done any
i love that yes
i also discovered that you can turn the speed up which i don't think a lot of people know if you're just like an audio book <unk> you can turn to speed up as they read very slowly so
i have gotten myself to where i can listen at a pretty fast rate and still understand everything that they're saying and that's been really how i consume a lot of books
and i think correct me if i'm wrong i think katie <unk> again and currently reading podcast has even said that's how she gets through so many books is if you listen on audio and if you just you even have to crank it up like crazy fast if you just knock the speed up just a little tiny bit
you will be amazed at how much more quickly you can get through a book and again since i do a lot of reading that's nonfiction i have no issues at all with just bump and that speed up cause i just couldn't get through whenever it is
yeah so great so those are katie oh my gosh what a list you have given us that is a huge gift just in time for the holidays you guys katie is giving us this gift
to inspire you are reading maybe we can all take this list and get a good head start on reading for twenty <unk> so

okay katie twenty twenty has been a rough year but you had a big life moment happen when you published your first book is called my storied year
so let's see where should even start i would love to hear kind of where did the story come to you first of all give us a little snapshot of what my storied year is about
and then maybe tell us the story how did this story come into your life into your mind walk us through a little bit of how the process was from taking it from like oh i have this idea too now you can hold in your hands you wrote a book you're an author tell us everything
okay so my storied year starts with dragon stewart he's a seventh grader and he is <unk> and he has a really hard life at home and he's got some bullying situations going on at school
but this year he has a new set of teachers and some new kids in his class and his english teacher who is my favorite really kind of pulls out the writer in him he's like a secret poet he has this journal that he carries around a writes poetry
and the otherwise doesn't really like to read or write because it's hard for him and he has counted the secret story that he doesn't really know if he should tell it or how he should tell it and so
through the year he kind of opened up to his friends more and then he's able to kind of reveal his story and so that's the basic premise of it
oh my goodness you have sent a copy is on the way to me i cannot wait again i love love love a middle grade novel and this just feel so <unk> already just hearing how you set up the story
you've mentioned that you taught elementary was that kind of a jumping off point for you in terms of how this character came into your mind
so when i taught writing was my absolute favorite thing to teach i did a lot of extensive training on writing and a lot of the things that she does in the book there's kind of like little writing lessons along the way that you could do with your kids if you are <unk> them or even teachers in the classroom
but a lot of those things i learned do my trainings and so i wanna support and like the whole writing is fairly almost for people you know how we put things into words and how our creativity kind of find out who we are and so
i wanted to pull in that aspect of it and dragon is really kind of a mixture of a lot of kids that i taught and i had some hard kids you're gonna teach for any amount of time you're gonna have some kids with some hard lives and so
he's a mixture of a bunch of different ones and i just had the beginning of my teaching i didn't understand these kids because that wasn't my life experience i grew up in a two parent household and
you know we were always financially stable and so i didn't struggle like that and so when i met these kids it was almost like i can't believe people like this exist you know i didn't have that context and so
i learned over the course of my years how to help you know these kids get through their daily lives and how to do things to help them and i wish i had done more and looking back you know you always wish
yeah
but dragon is just a mixture of all those kids so i wanted kids to be able to see that kids like this are real and that they do have real problems and how you know
they need support at school from their friends from their teachers i wanted to write it for teachers to see how you know they can be so important in these kids lives especially if their home life is not stable
another teacher might be there one adult that loves them and so i wanted to put that in the book too
yes yeah that is so true i mean teachers can have a huge impact on our lives sometimes not even an good way but definitely in positive ways
and i think that can happen at any point along our journey but i think those middle grade years or so tender and so formative and
when you have a teacher in your life that really sees you and is really able to help you to discover who you are that is absolutely in actual life changer so
yeah what a great contacts to set the story in as you have this idea in so obviously gonna be fiction in that fiction writing process and maybe this even differs depending on if you're writing children's or middle grade or why a or adult
do you fully write the book and then start to go to agents and publishers and say okay i have this thing or do you taught on the publishing and first and then go and write like what was the process like for you
so it's different for fiction and nonfiction which i didn't even know until i had kind of gone through but what happened with i wrote and it was new in this book that i wrote i wrote another manuscript
there's a huge writing conference in dallas fort worth called d f w con it's a big writing conference and
with your conference ticket you get ten minutes with a literary agent to pitch your work at that point i had a finished manuscript and when i was kind of researching the conference for fiction they want you to have a complete manuscript
before you ever contact anybody for non fiction it's a little bit different because they wanna make sure that they can sell the book before he go like write all of it they see if you have a platform and you write a proposal and all that stuff but the book doesn't necessarily have to be done
for fiction generally they want you to have a complete manuscript before you start pitching at anybody so i sat down with his agent i kind of gave her my elevator pitch about the book
and then she asked me to send her the full manuscript which is kind of the best thing that you can hear at a conference cause some people will say i'll pass on this or send the five pages or whenever she asked for the full thing
so i send it to her and then you know six eight ten months later she got i mean it's a long waiting process
because they have so many manuscripts that are coming into them and they have to read them and this woman actually ended up being my agent and i'm so grateful for her because she didn't just send back like i don't want this
she sent back a list of really helpful notes for revisions and she said if you wanna like revise and then <unk> i'll be happy to look at it again she was like i don't think we can sell it as it is right now but i'll be happy to look at it again
so i took her notes did a lot of things work with a professional editor and then send it back to her and then she agreed to represent me so that's kind of how that situation but that was like a <unk> process probably from start to finish
and then once she has it i still went back and re wrote it probably two or three times not a major re hall but just like these parts seem to be fixed
and then she started to shop it to publisher so she did the same thing i did to find an agent she had to send out yellow letters and samples and all that stuff to different publishers until we found one
my publishing <unk> kinda like wacky because my publisher bought the first book that i wrote but then they said what else does she have so we sent her my storied year
and then they are like we honest publish this one first they felt like it was really timely and they wanted to get it out there
first and then the first book that i sold will actually come out in june so that's like totally a different book but they wanted to get this one out
is it a middle grade novel too
it's also middle grade and it's historical fiction so it's totally like on a different level than this one but yes
that is <unk> i mean you say that the timeline was a little wacky but if i've learned anything from my friends who are authors it's that like the timelines always crazy like everything takes so long
and then sometimes you write the like i've had friends who are non fiction authors who write the whole thing submitted in the publishers i can we don't wanna do this after all i get i mean that there's always like so many twists and turns on the publishing journey
so i can only imagine yeah that every single one i'm sure how surprises along the way some may be are not so happy surprises but what has surprised you in a way that you really like this was a happy surprise about the publishing process
the thing that surprised me the most wasn't really happy with how long it took cause you know i'm like i wrote this book it goes get it out i didn't realise how long of a process that is from like hitting it from a raw draft to an actual book
but i think the thing that surprises me in the best way is that i have just met so many good people that like my editor is one of my favorite people she is gracious but she's tough and she's you know cut this you know
let's fix this part cause it's not quite working and i've just learned a lot about myself as a writer and about good writing and so that's been really really good
i also i wanna encourage anybody who's writing to find yourself a writing group and it doesn't have to be someone you meet with like my writing i found from <unk> awesome we are in the <unk> awesome writers
spin off group and someone was brave enough and just said hey who wants to be an a writing group and so we're all over the place like i'm in texas and there's one in new york and one in lebanon and one and you know connecticut
and we just all we send each other our work every weekend we have a <unk> that we can process through all of our writing questions then you know the days there were like this is horrible why am i doing this we have a place for that so that's been really really helpful
oh my gosh that gives me chills i love that part of the story obviously

the person that's nice and understanding is gonna go to the bottom but that's not what we need to talk about
no
and ah cause that it's weird that i see you upset i'm usually just like hey let me do this and then we'll we'll be done with that situation in in probably twenty minutes
um <unk> is having a little problem with the dryer people said hey she you can get a new <unk> dryer <unk> <unk> <unk> while i just moved into new house none of that is exciting whatsoever
um i don't know what's going on with you and home depot and why cause home depot is right across the street
it's a whole thing
i i'm to the point where i would i'm going to just drive there if i don't give a satisfactory answer out of your by tomorrow with home depot i'm going to put the the dryer in the back of my pickup
walk in no mask cause this is my dream now i wanna i also wanna incorporate my dream in there
i know there's gonna be a ah an <unk> woman at the front who is like sir mask i'm gonna be like
fuck you i've had it alright
hold it like dragging
yep
the dryer by the wire
yeah i've already got it mapped out of my mind
that long courts that has no fucking box around it's
ah <unk>
and it's just like
walk in to the dryer section ask who whoever who's the the <unk> of the the plain section it'd be one fucking bob that raises his hand hey bob you fucked my wife over
gonna happen to you i'm gonna put this in the middle of your goddamn <unk> and i'm gonna take the dryer i want i'm not gonna give you my phone number i'm gonna instead give you my address that way you can just come to my house if you have a fucking problem with it
we can settle in the front yard or you can get fucked
cuz you can probably just get ahead and call the police ah right away
and then i walk out without my mask on and just wave and once again scream out i've had covid i'd ah i'm over your bullshit it was three days like diarrhea i don't care just shut the fuck up about covid
i don't need to hear it any more
some
yeah
you need that i'm i want to do that that's the thing
love doing shit like that
i know and it's nice to have at my disposal and i know that i do you know but i wanna take care of it myself um
i'm also one of the the last people on earth who loves a good physical comfort
sure sure sure and i understand that and i
in the street
you're in my back pocket that's for sure
you know what i mean
okay
you know what i mean um it's diane and and a jake and
yeah if i don't get the answer that i want and need today they will understand what i
what i was gonna do i was gonna bring my phone put it on um voice memo yeah and have the entire conversation with jake and diane and possibly al the manager
ah they know me too they know my number and hi miss peterson ah um and so we have a relationship now
did i ever want to have a relationship and know by name three mother fucking people that work at home depot never
no
never i went in on a saturday in november yeah beginning of november
ah
i went in and i went in on a saturday i got
i got ah i needed to do a bunch of stuff so at home depot
i got <unk> dryer oven right yeah yeah yeah it's a good amount of money i don't wanna say how much it is but it's enough that like you should probably take care of someone right
and they're gonna do installation
these are the dates these are the things here's all your your money you paid great that was supposed to be the last time that i went in to that home depot
yeah
i've been in six times
because of um various things so
what is stopping you from letting me go just finish this for you like i i can't even hear the story what is stopping you from letting me finish this i don't understand
i don't know i feel like i'm so close
god
i feel like i'm at the last
you are describing every
like every single person america who's just like oh no
why you should let me finish
ah i'll finish the home depot thing
that's why you should let me finish because i'm every person in america
no
okay
no you shouldn't
usual
time time man i've i've tried to tell people this all the time is the most valuable thing we have
some people just don't mind wasting it um i don't know like you you're you're busy as shit
i don't know why you have this much time to do i i'll just go in there and end this today for christ sakes and i'd love to do it i'd be happy to do it <unk>
okay
i get a pick up truck all crank up the christmas music being fucking <unk>
as loud as it'll go
hop out without a mask on
fuck you santa let's go ah and get the drier of your dreams unless i'll be in and out of there in fifteen minutes she had that bitch be plugged up with a stick or fucking hands in there and warm up
been in an half hour
both ways present their challenges like not every time does that work for you and not every time does my my way work
but sometimes they both work right
i don't know i don't know
it doesn't always work for you you have to admit it does not always work for you to go and be an asshole
remember the last time it hasn't worked
define work you know what i mean working it's like did you get i don't know
i got all the things all the things that i ordered whatever i ordered and paid for i look at it like old school like fucking medieval times shit where you just bordering with people
money or a credit card is the same thing is like a fucking <unk> shell or it's like oh can i can i train you for food you're a great hunter and i've got this jewel that you need to give your wife like can we just
that's the way i treated like hey man did i pay for this yes or no when were you supposed to do it on that day did you do it no therefore i'm just taking your shit
and you can figure the fuck out on the back end cause all it is all these people sure don't wanna do paperwork for shit that's it so just walk in and drop it off then they'll be forced to do the paperwork because they don't have a god damn choice
and if they go through the system and it's like oh man was i supposed to be here oh that's why that guy walked in the middle of fucking christmas and just dropped off a drier in the middle the store and said fuck everyone you know what i'm saying
alright i'm done with that
yeah
now that you are saying it's like they really have fucked me over
yes dude for like two months there's an oven in the middle of our garage
that has been sitting there for six weeks and everyday i'm just like
the fuck are we gonna do that's a brand new oven
i called them and they forgot about me they said
ah did they you know who they wouldn't forget about
what's up fuck boys we're cooking food today aren't we
i will tie up a <unk> and have them come install it by hands like for real at home depot and i don't even give a shit cause the beauty of it is in what we do for a living is people expected out of me
so even if the story went viral went on t m z and i like hey man ross <unk> is the guy from that fucking podcast that's a crazy <unk> like what happened to him
oh we walked into a home depot with a brand new oven and just dropped it on the floor to or or kidnapped an employee and adam come over to the house of course he did we listened to that show every day
every cop in america listens to this show it would be like ah shit was that ross who did that <unk> i knew he would i knew he would do shit like that
come on <unk> that's what it is you know
yeah
guys is it a <unk> or worse experience than the carpet crew
oh jeez i mean
ah i just
that's what i said to the carpet guy
rebuke is ah in witness protection
he's done
a z e m t gave us five bucks and said love you guys you're awesome thank you so much
um wish he worked at home depot and so ah
i am so horrified to admit ah um when that happened he called me i said no problem dude mistakes happen
oh god
fix it
every time it's just i ah ah yeah
you're living in the <unk> this is a now this is a
oh yeah
this is a now world it is fucking <unk> rule the world do you should have showed up with a fucking cell phone stuck it right in his goddamn face
i know about that where's your fucking shit
they would have that on your goddamn
jesus christ
yeah
fucking arthur <unk> himself who invent who and started home depot
would have showed up and fucking screwed that in
arthur fucking blank you owe me anyways arthur you fucked up the falcons bro
hiring damned fucking quinn come on arthur
yeah it's the it's the owner of home depot the guy who invented it that <unk> would have been in the house installing the oven in fifteen minutes is we live like ten minutes away from that goddamn place
so let me know <unk> i've got nothing to do this afternoon
you know
yes you do your fake news really have a
ten million things to do but still i'll i'll be honest with you ah i don't mind shit like this and i don't mind confrontation it helps me feel live inside
yeah
it does ah to the point where i'm jealous of like other people being able to do shit all the time like <unk>
yeah
they are they are unstoppable like this fucking taylor swift thing i woke up to this morning
um i'm i am all in ah i'm this is the day she broke me today december tenth ah in the year of our lord two thousand twenty
is that correct
um
is this the after death bob ah bob
no this is
it's the year of our lord <unk>
yeah
yeah
okay great
yeah you know you don't start at one
ah you you always wonder i'm not a religious man you know never proclaimed to be ah prayed to priest once um on halloween and i feel like i did a pretty good job
today is the day she broke me december tenth <unk> taylor swift is the greatest female musician of all time ah i i'm ready to declare it i woke up this morning
top trending story taylor swift turns <unk> and as a surprise for herself and her fans she is releasing yet another album
tonight at midnight
with bonny bonny bears on it
the <unk> back
hey
i wanna go super german with it
<unk> the sisters
hot bob has been texting about a dead person all morning ah bob they are dead you're not bringing him back to life any more
that's him but how do you pronounce it is it <unk>
it's <unk>
ah that looks like <unk>
this is for the jewish word
yeah
if we're talking about the band a time yeah
the person's dead you not bring them back to life i'm sorry i love you and quit texting their dead
looks like an <unk> did you bang her hot bob
great then what would would you know and then that's when you feel weird about it how shitty it is to fuck that dead person um that's when you starts to feel really <unk> about your life you got like ah
oh shit that's happened to me
yeah it's happened me too you yeah you're just like oh shit it's a fuck that dead person i know and then you think of them dead um anyways ah with taylor swift yet <unk> is on this one <unk> varus is back for another track the nationals on it's
and it's a full track list is not a bullshit kanye <unk> six songs and i'm calling it an album no it's like <unk> fucking songs on this thing
and there's not only gonna be one hit every fucking song's gonna be amazing
yes yeah yes
if you watch on youtube i i'm jealous of her work ethic like it it it it bothers me to a point where i'm just like oh fuck man it's like it's a <unk> with me um because that's my work ethic and obviously
we have children she single and can do whatever the fuck she wants all day but ah part is just like oh man and because i woke up to that and then i got like a million emails are like messages
ah d <unk> from people who who had gotten as the sun rises it <unk> on him and which is outs everywhere i went full
taylor swift dropped the paper back and all that other shit to beat the ah amazon bullshit i understand you don't weigh on the other you're times bestseller list again so you are not releasing the <unk> that's the way to get there
i clearly know what you're doing however i also know how publishing works if i put out the fucking paper <unk> its print on demand or be a people's houses and forty-eight hours to get fucked i just want the product in there i'm already a new york times bestselling author
my last book is already number one in the world i can't go higher than that at this point so don't give a shit it's christmas is when everybody to have their shit and enjoyed that being said
fucking sixty messages i got this morning we're people had read it already in thirty-six hours and they were like holy shit couldn't put it down that wins the maximum coming out in him like
fuck i have so much shit to do otherwise i i would just sit there like taylor swift go watch the doc on disney channel right
she's given up on life because she's just working now just wanna be hot more as a care about being hot any more startling get that <unk> of the spine because she's over writing so much
get all that shit too
and it oddly made me jealous where i was just like oh fuck i could grind out another one in his goddamn things easily ah if i had the time and i just don't have time for it um and this one took like a year
family
it's not that this one's took a year these things are so hard to write because every other line is a one liner it's a joke so it's like you've
constantly got to update and refresh and make these jokes as fresh as they can possibly be but also in a time period way and like it's very very difficult
otherwise yeah dude at everybody's like man i i want another one i'm like dude you're gonna get it now you're gonna get it in two years
nah it's not going to be now or my wife is going to leave me and that's what it is but then i look at taylor swift oh is that your second album that you are putting out this year
cause the first one was nominated for seventeen fucking <unk> and then you are like nah guess what's not good enough that someone to drop another fucking album on birthday that will not be eligible for any trophies because the <unk>
ah the timeline is passed so that's not gonna be eligible for up till next year um it's incredible i'm i'm all done she's the greatest female musician of all time and if this album is just as great as the last one was
fucking amen i might sign up for her thing is her a kitty cat club
yeah
where i can get
like yes
so
yes i think so
i think there is right
yeah oh yeah
no
yeah
so ah man i get it ah but i will say this as everybody is always asking about the audio book two weeks
um audible were released about two weeks um we got like the rights from like <unk> redemption and some other shit like this is fucking rat like there will be nothing like this in the world solely those that to look forward to but ah yeah man i
i used to just lock myself up and fucking write like this for hours and was around the same age we were just like very sweet i was like
certainly do that again
no you can't when we're not family and your wife
family lives in another house and you just pay <unk> stuff like that
i'm joking quit no you can i think it's hard on you as well as you do like you write all night
yes
like
yeah nah so
but do it
no i can't i can't i can't can't do it isn't you stumble around the house you are just like yeah
and it's like who's coming and i'll take a guess yeah
look it's whatever
sure sure um because i would love to have making into the i i already outlines there but um it is what is know we've gotta we've gotta take some time off and the girls at some point you just break probably
well not you but we will
yeah you as well not me obviously um because it was one year i was trying to think about it today with taylor swift ship wreck i was like damn that is unbelievably prolific
there was one year i wrote five films that then the following year i wrote three and then shot all of them produced all of them starred in all of them directed all of them
which ones
ah it was donald dawkins um pool boy and then f d r american badass three wildly different movies like across the board
yeah
she wrote all of those shot all of those produced all and star and in the same fucking year and ah in the year before i had written five films for this other deal ah that's ah i was i was the <unk> for it but it was worth it
sure
and pneumonia that's when i hit that doctor up the concierge doctor which we're we're having a hard time with here i hit a concierge doctor up that i used to have the rock doc in l a and a go hey man i owe one more scripts for this package and he goes ah
i can't do it
and i think i'm something wrong with me not like physically wrong with me and that's when you guess you have pneumonia and ah stated all the tests and they do an m r i for pneumonia which i was unaware of right because they've gotta examine your lungs to make sure you are not gonna
fill up or die or have fluid or whatever his look after this i would highly recommend going to the hospital whatever and he has how important is that to you is it worth dying over and i was like this one deal at the time and i was like yeah it is right what do you need and i was like
<unk> let's give me the full bottle <unk> so i can get through this right
okay
yeah
they do have um morphine <unk> i thought that's what you are talking
no no no ah i didn't know what that would do with the syrup i did at least so yes they did have that um but the syrup i was just like hey man gimme two of those jugs and let's get on with our lives ah i'd bang that shit out and fuck in eight days
to this day that is when my favorite scripts i've ever written and i and i don't remember reading one word of it not one it's called it's called bleed hard
oh yeah
proof of <unk> um certain current day and it was about a <unk> who it wasn't a <unk> he was ah bar back and his mom died in a miami and me kill an accident
ah and all he cared about was <unk> so like every piece of glass inside this bar had to be ah just right and it was gonna star kevin <unk> and it was it took place in like <unk>
and why can't we do why can't we oh well
well i
or making shit
no he's making anything cause that's the other question i get is hey man when he has to make another movie is just like dude nobody's paying for movies anymore no one and even if you are where's it going where are you gonna put that up because netflix isn't buying they are not doing that shit
um
where could we put it
youtube ah not youtube
yeah you can put on youtube but it's like
you put it on amazon
you're just giving a movie away for free guy yeah you can put it up on amazon prime yeah um
or on our website right
yeah you could <unk> youtube
oh yeah yeah
you you could put like vimeo art made me that that offers as well we're there will i will get a ninety percent we only keep ten that's how desperate they are to get me out of vimeo notions like what the fuck is i get i didn't know there is a
youtube would be easy
it would yeah so everybody's donated i would give the movie free ownership with that
but i wouldn't be free but it will be a small fee on youtube you put it behind a <unk> on youtube
well you can do them on amazon if you are gonna do it you know might as well do i which is give it away to five summers paid for italian fuck
justin <unk> and ah
yeah yeah <unk> will put it up
<unk> is trying to make his dreams happen right now and ah
did you see this horse and pete they are looking at
a horse and pete
it's the you remember um
is awful
yeah
really well with that model right of just like putting everything on his site five bucks or seven bucks to whatever it is
yep except for this one ah this one was a colossal failure for him
yeah
i watched two episodes i couldn't get through any more
i got what they were trying to do i just didn't want that to be happening in my eyes and my ears
yeah yeah yeah
<unk> right now if you're watching on youtube but <unk> um his dream is going on now and we're trying to figure this out ah <unk>
i i think it's fair to say you're the biggest show rogan fan i've ever met
um and not saying in a bad way i love <unk>
i mean
it's great
did joe rogan sphere like he likes a lot of people around joe rogan and joe rogan what he's created like right
right now are you still doing scene at the w t f
ah yeah i went there last night to watch a few other ah local austin com

ah so right now there is a like a once in a lifetime event going on and ah it's joe rogan
dave <unk> and friends and they are doing a five night local residents see here at <unk> barbecue

my guys got them for was
two tickets for fifteen hundred

twenty-two hundred dollars yeah
and i don't know how many <unk> you guys have bought lately
i'd say i'll tell you what <unk> what is how much is twenty hundred bucks
no what you want the whole table or you want to
well no it's
oh no no i was just i was just messing around
just tell us what it is you want two or you want
or are you trying to bring a lady is this what you are trying to do
hold on hold on

you just need to say what it is that you actually wanna do
yeah what is your dream here because that by the way friday is tomorrow that is the last day the joe rogan is actually gonna do with <unk>
you know that right
oh that's right because all the other ones are just appalling friends
correct yes yes yes
i would love to just be there be standing side stage by myself you know as soon as soon as day finishes a set <unk> a cigarette looks at me gives me a wink
not a fucking dream that can't happen dude
that's my dream
tickets to the show
yes i do yes
your dream not what your dreams are
alright
not what your hopes and dreams are like for this exact thing in the parameters that i've just laid out for you
you have someone in mind
i have a friend visiting in town
a lady
is she she worthy of that
we are gonna leave that
worthy of that extra ticket
i mean dan's got a better butt
but i think he's just been hitting <unk> lately so
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
um cause what we could do is ask people in the comments section
be like him and i pick up the rest for christmas um what is it <unk> hundred for the table
he wants just two tickets for fifteen hundred dollars
yeah yeah yeah yeah
or now we're talking about hot bob and like dan says like a like a <unk> magna our young i like we might need this table yet i'm not gonna leave my my
never mind you should have been an asshole you were gonna get a ticket and now you were nice you see what happens we're gone full circle now you were nice and it's not gonna fucking happen
i i don't i don't understand that doing anything in ah ah on the youtube people do and i know we're grateful for it but
if anybody <unk> anything we'll pick up
will match it yeah won't won't for christmas will match it if you want a san <unk> to joe rogan and dave <unk> tomorrow night's um but <unk> and the thing
we'll see if this happens i don't know i again i have no idea how this works on youtube like with tipping people and all that shit and liked whatever it is but ah yeah if you want georgia to go we'll do it do you know how it works
i think it's a tax write off cuz technically
for the company itself so like
ah if if you want georgia to go
we're about to find out their love for <unk> on here because if if not in the end you don't get seven hundred dollars
yeah i'm not sure i'm not sure how any of this works on the super chat
i keep getting d <unk> wondering if people can donate less than a dollar
and that's the love they had
<unk> jacob nickel all is so right now there's there's twelve dollars for <unk> to go live out his dream
i love it we are on track will do it for every show how about that we'll do it as the daily total
yeah yeah well
i know but i'm just saying that
richard didn't just have to he gave a hundred dollars
richard
christmas
you rich
ten dollars
josh
dave flips him off five dollars
we we are to make a wish foundation
hot bob we'll do this for you too and you've been here
this is like ah donating presents to an orphanage and then getting all the orphans so drunk
did you go i don't know bro
tony <unk> just gave you twenty dollars
o my gosh
papa g
follow your dream
recommend doing that
but for this instance like i said the parameters of what we're saying not you going on stage with
yeah yeah yeah but i will say this so jesse and i went ah jesse got tickets for for me when the book came out and it was a nice surprise christmas thing and ah we we were in the front row ah we didn't know
i know
it it was only like it was only like forty tables at this place so you don't
you know mom was uncomfortable
five dollars for danny k ah
be best <unk>
the guy on the people at our table is that we have to go in groups of four six ah dave <unk> in the middle of the show leaned down and just get your two feet away from him just leaned down and and lit his cigarette off the table
the guy
rihanna he's gave five dollars happy pine cone
ah we're trying to make dreams come true for georgia here to go see joe rogan and
happening and he's gonna test positive for covid
happens you need to quarantine
wait for the tickets for the brand papa georgia another ten from <unk> g g <unk>
papa g i don't know what this is for
think he thinks it's to see your dick i think
no so what it is i again if you're just tuning in now it is to help ah <unk> lived his christian history he's always wanted to see joe rogan and dave <unk> they are playing this magical show for five nights in a row
ah it is all worth it it's the craziest one of the craziest events we've ever been to i was like what the fuck is happening um but ah
yeah it was interesting um
it was awesome so we'll we'll talk about it then you keep donating money for <unk> i will match it and then will
five dollars madam quarter <unk> from from andrew fernandez
my gosh this is gonna happen
this is gonna happen georgia i feel like it's going to happen um
and if it's not that girl you better find a fucking another one now
yeah a fifty dollars from homer can't do anything
she should be pretty good to not go with you
you said dan has a better butt than her and you're asking us how to not take her
tally of this so that way we know you don't to follow any notes the rest of the show you just keep a running tally here so we know we have ah but i would imagine we're three or four hundred dollars short of sending <unk> to joe rogan and dave <unk> for christmas
um this would be hilarious and fucking awesome so you and i got to go um it is super private we had to lock up our phones and ah what are those called the ah fucking <unk> or the <unk>
are you with me
for what
ha for you to lock up your phones to get in the case
oh yeah
what's it's called the fernandez
it's like the <unk> or the <unk> or the and ah <unk> chair or
yeah
something like that
yeah whatever is rights of another five dollars do you think papa g it is were probably three or four bucks away from from getting him to go
um with that you had to take a covid test walking in and ah you get there and they're like hey man you've got to get there the show started at like <unk>
and there was like a million comedians that how many would you say we saw seven
yeah
total
um anyways ah that night was tony
the host plus the d j yeah yeah
yeah yeah tony <unk> came out ah the host the d j and all in the end that those stage that make the shift stage set up like ah
here we are fifteen for papa g from <unk> <unk> and ah <unk> from your jorge <unk> mario boy
i were getting closer why we are probably three hundred blocks away at this point um so when you when you walk in you're like hey man you gotta get there at four thirty p m and i was like shit
for what oh cuz we've got nurses who were in full hospital gowns in a whole god damn tents set up like it's side of the road for a covid test
um ah
they jammed the pipe cleaner down your nose and then test you really quickly there ah well fifteen minutes we had to wait
yeah
um and then
but that's rapid if any hospitals are wondering where the rapid tests are they are at <unk> show
so right where they need to be
the setup that they have
is is honestly better than the sight of it's better than any hospital has and ah you're getting right in there yonder is the name of that phone device by the way
um so you wait in the stalls and they actually do call them stalls
oh yes go to stall number one
yes wait in your stall with your party we're all gonna send a nurse over to get you covid tested and then when she passed five dollars from tighten your <unk> make proud papa g
um once you get tested then they're like hey enjoy the night um good luck and all that other fucking bullshit right but not before taking your phone from you immediately
right
and i was just like ah shit
yeah
so we don't we walk in and we have no idea we're front row um
it was amazing for me like i loved not having the phone
i love not having a phone too the only thing
experiences like that i was like this is fucking rad because you can say can say it
he can say that this happened but you're the only one that really experience
well if you take that post malone story right it was so unbelievable i still have people that that come up in the street and be like hey show me the picture um
have that one picture because our phones were locked up in yonder that night no one would believe me that
it was one guy that he let take his phone out to like play music and that guy was like either friends with him
and was like as he was changing the song like took a picture but
yeah um and ah so somebody said sounds off and it was fucking awesome and i and i'll tell you why
ah cuz once you're in the only weird part is they had like a million photographers there for joe rogan and dave <unk> i was like they were shooting photos on i was like but the rest of us can't
what are they what are you gonna do with the same photos of yourself all god damn day
john carter five dollars for papa g um so we get there we're front row and and i'm like oh shit we're in front row you didn't know
no
i didn't know cuz it's just a it's just a number of a table and that's what we are in covid yeah you have no idea
cause there's like bars and weird little stage kinda things everywhere so you don't know for you're picking is the front or the whatever
right and so they they there's a woman that walks you to your table you have to wait for that too and she walks us up there and she likes the ticket she was oh
oh you guys are like you guys are like the best seats and i like really and we just kept going to the front i'm like oh my god this makeshift stage is probably about this tall says about as tall as this desk right here
and ah ah what would you say we are three feet away two and a half feet away from them like um
the guy that was right across from us on the table
yeah
just had to lean up she was like do you know what i mean he didn't walk towards anything he literally just stood up and lit his cigarette
yes that's how close that dave <unk> was chris <unk> ah said because jesse told me to have fun papa g be best
fifty dollars ah casey ray five dollars papa g money for your hometown shut up
christie pays the best he gave me might be best necklace
yes ah jeff mule says five dollars for <unk> <unk> for papa g
boom
one <unk>

ah homer can throw another two dollars logan will point another five dollars for papa <unk> dreams come true order some food gets some <unk> and join our life they brought out white claw buckets
reagan just get a bucket a white claw or any other beer bottles of wine
mom got a bottle of <unk>
they and and
me too
they do yeah it's two and the weird part about it was when i they said their bottles service is like what bottles should any bottle you want
you wanna bottle of whisky i was like oh shit i didn't know it was that kinda party i was like god damn dude
so was red and then people just kept coming out like tony <unk>
ah that other comedian who is the <unk> the <unk> guy that i was i had you guys look up he was pretty fucking good he's got is own netflix special the arab guy um
he was actually one of my favorites
he was great he crushed ah and then rogan came outs ah rogan was great <unk> came out <unk> was fucked up
wasted wasted
did ninety minutes on transgender people
yeah um he's gotten more into a storytelling type of um comedy just one long story which is great it's fine
it's awesome it's it look it is totally unique and different and everything else you're like holy shit
um and you're so close to these people that i that's the beauty of this covid shit she's like can you do get to go to some weird like this like
because of all the testing and everything else like you're just right here i can't get a punch i get a punch him in the face if i wanted to like he was in eye line to me
the only thing i did say when we are in the stalls is like from what they're telling us in the world with covid or whatever percentage wise
ah people have to have been turned away right just from if we just go off percentage of what people are telling us on the news right
yes
that place was fucking packed
and not one person
and not one person got turned away in terror <unk>
yeah a j gamble gave up four <unk> four <unk> to <unk> at this concert
you bring somebody will show like this <unk> i'm gonna be honest with you yes you deserve a <unk> um but ah yeah no one no one magically tested positive for covid
like crazy um but ah at the end of it's it felt like a like we were somebody's house like a house party where everybody's gotten super fucked up
ah so dave <unk> at the end ah just said ah cuz you can get a full d j and everything the setup was like <unk> show to be honest with you
so he could refer back he had him play random songs sometimes if something he's talking about and at the end he was like
he goes i want ah man i just wanna i wanna feel love with everybody i love all these people lets just all sing a song together and i was like what
and ah he says like yeah lets just sing a song together if i play song you guys sing it with me we're like ah yeah fuck it i guess um so he plays
we turns around asked the d j to play <unk> creep
yeah
by <unk> and so all these strangers who we had all sat in the stall and got shit jammed in our faces and resolve fucked up eating barbecue i i i think
we had to watch tony <unk>
he was great
i know
he was great i know you're not a fan and i was in everybody's great and he was he had the best set of the night so you know so
um with that we all sang this song with all these fucking strangers every fucked up and like it was an unbelievable night and you're just like
it was unbelievable the poetic there was something poetic about that because <unk> won't even play creep in their concerts
right right
they refused to
yeah yeah yeah
like something really beautiful about that happening like the way that it should have happened at an actual <unk> concert
but it never would've but then you're with <unk> like singing <unk> it's like ten million times better and ah joe rogan is looking at rogue
yeah joe <unk> is looking at <unk> like he wants like he's in love with him
he was just like he didn't even say anything for the second encore he was just looking at <unk> like you're amazing
ah yeah and and and every single person saying it right here's the thing i'm surprised that dave <unk> knew all the words to creep by <unk> like
nah man he's he's cool
ah ah yeah either way it was fucking rad and then everybody walks out there because you don't have phones and you are not allowed to take a picture of it
like no one will believe me what just happened but i think that's also the set up to where it's like hey man we're gonna do this thing it's a weird fucking time in the universe
and this is what it's gonna be your a part of it and you'll be able to tell the story
um luckily we've a show that reaches you know a <unk> people otherwise
no one knows about any of the shit that's going on we're like isn't that cool yes yes it is
also why it is that cool because of the phones not being there so people are allowed to say words they are not suppose to say which i am not gonna say it here
but they don't have the fear of cellphone you know picking up some part of the set that's taken out of context and than cause he's been burned many times before
they all they all have yeah yeah
that was that's the beauty of it like look there's no other way for us to do this so you don't have your phones
therefore you're going to get the comedy that you want to get that you used to get and that we want to give you right
without anyone else being involved than the people that paid for it wanted to be here and know exactly what they're getting into right
and everybody who was there ah dropped all of the words that ah may i not just even one of those will get you cancelled
but than ah no one gave a fuck of the joke yeah
it worked you take that out in one clip and put it up somewhere and they're cancelled right
what's the running tally <unk> what do we got here
we since you told me to start keeping count more about a hundred and sixty nine dollars i i didn't fuck with the change so i just kinda rounded up so it's like a hundred and <unk> dollars ah
no no that is not true
since i started count he's like just drop you're doing just count this
i'm looking at it
three to five hundred dollars right now
yeah yeah yeah we're about to three to five i'd say we're about <unk> short now cuz i'm i'm looking at here at the top so ah we have all show
we will send papa <unk> to his to his dream i just wonder who he'll take now that's the thing
i mean that's an easy decision for me to be honest i mean if all these people are thrown this money out there is a very special very special person i have in mind
i've already talked about their butt here today on the show and it's a mister cash register over here
oh a hundred percent like cuz like i have no like
thought the that's really worth the <unk> ticket and if all these fans are pitched in like this then you know
ah look at that look at that alright we need about two hundred and fifty dollars more here and that's it
sorry hop bob
they trade at the tray <unk> just did the count went back to the account was four hundred and <unk> dollars
and <unk> cents okay so
and an office manager and just somebody to shoot guns to the ceilings here because we got high ceiling you can't get away with it nobody's gonna say shit
ah really huge studio to two hundred fifty bucks more we can all all pick up the other part of half and send it to saint <unk> ah and fit in there
ah richard did not just put in a hundred you're halfway there
richard is slowly going over to fake dan fake dan is now richards favorite and he's not wanting to tell me

when she exited the plane the woman was only wearing a t-shirt and her underwear <unk> faces charges of <unk> conduct public intoxication
and a witness on the flight said the woman had <unk> on herself and removed her pants
you are like are picturing what's happening so she got on drunk which we see always right if you're going from vegas back home due to l a for example
for example like you're going to see a <unk> going home or so somebody that's like a little bit intoxicated or super hung over or had a little bit of something to get on the plane so
pretty normal on <unk> bros
no it's not on <unk> bros
oh okay
she's got a baby though god keep going oh boy i
i didn't put her name out there the daily mail did so anyway ah yeah so anyway she was you know she's having some fun in texas may be she i don't she lives somewhere else but anyway she ended up going to alabama which that's horrible
yeah but she's wasted you're like okay like there's a ways a person wherever she's gonna pass out and what happens after that is what you would hope right when you see this girl walked down the aisle which you know
yeah
she's wasted and she's dressed from the night before so she's already dressed like sexy kind of right she just got out she barely made the flight right didn't sleep at all
i found the video

ah oh my
she was drinking wine either on the plane in the airport so in the airport they'll fucking over serve the shit out of you it's when you actually get on the plane that they wouldn't give her a drink probably

i like the office oh yeah that thing thing like i like breakfast for dinner sometimes i know i'm crazy everybody fucking does everybody does not one person doesn't like fucking pancakes for dinner
you idiot okay you like the office so you have eyes and ears carry on
sound for or likes here
i fucking know right like i know her
wait we can't show that get of their um
it's not on it's just for our it's just for our enjoyment
i i feel like we know this person i know that's so weird but i know i feel like we fucking know this person dude
so ah likes blessed to be bless is one of the groups that she likes on um facebook i knew that was jessie
yeah she's kicked out of that
snack batch
what
is another one snack batch so um that is a girl's meet the <unk> um <unk> <unk>
she's a big fan of on um the <unk> does look nice there's some outdoor <unk> and things like that um and then are bomb <unk> plastic surgery that is ah michael bum <unk> m d a plastic surgeon
so i don't i'm not aware of what sir michael's but like i'm looking at this with what could be her boyfriend here or maybe not her boyfriend i'm not sure he looks like a normal dude
counts i can count the guy on the right looks like scooter braun at the dancers as does get around the second relief um
not a bad looking dude to whatever and ah yeah man i mean just just going through um in a favorite people who like tv shows always weird to me
what's another t v show that she likes
ah she's a baseball fan one of the restaurant she likes is the friendly confines ultimate ultimate spring sets in california
yeah but she is the kind of girl that she does that to get laid
that could be fair like nobody updates to their interests on facebook since like <unk>
so true like i would hate to look at mine
yeah i know i don't use you're right i haven't done either i think i'm or the people i liked him and in a shit i'm not gonna judge the weird thing is to feel quite another person
i do really feel like we know her
and i'm not even mad at anything that went on that flight at all we've all been there
to totally
you know
totally
personally have never been there but i've been like
ah the only thing is if you're on a flight in you're in that small fort tube because it looked small that plane
smelling someone else's <unk> but i guess you're wearing masks everybody was wearing masks because of covid
no i would have
<unk> would have made me <unk> all over the floor too
cause you're already smelling everybody's <unk> in the fart tube
but that then also i think we would have also been a little hung over depending on where the plane was do i mean it was like every time i get on a plane <unk> i go if this thing fucking crashes
i think i'd be like okay with it
somebody said <unk> said a white cloth mermaid dude that it does it does remind me exactly oh my god you're right you nailed it it was a girl on cruise for sure yeah
holy shit that's so funny yeah i feel like we know the spirit like a for real that's so funny she's not at <unk> bros yeah
um the girls meet the internet picture what was that
it's just a like hand over a mouse
no it's two fingers over a vagina
nope that is a mouse pad just that was connected to them i understand
oh okay but what is that about
um look it's a very
would you run me like what is the group that's what i mean that we'll meet the internet
one that's a great one um that's it like i that i am i'm actually very proud of that graphic you know and who did it
you know it's it's great i'm just wondering about that
it's funny how you saw pussy first and then i saw a mouse but i guess that just who we are you know and i don't see women as objects um you now i see them as people who enjoy <unk>
if it was a dick you would have seen that first do you know what it mean it's just all what you got
<unk> he says that what p h category is she under might know her from there and he's laughing what p h stands for
porn hub
ah there it is there is it
we are cool we know what's up
so you wanna porn hub anymore you gotta just deny we're going there now
right because there are are <unk> people on youtube for this have you heard about this if you talk about porn hub it's like fight club
if you talk about porn hub or you're out of there and ah i there have been a really hard time with under age people uploading sex videos and shit like that so
i understand that i knew would happen eventually but ah you know even look all the best and eventually go down girls gone wild all that shit remember there was a five million lawsuits against that guy you know joe francis
well here's the thing he asked for i d and then in you know got consent allegedly or somebody else
but ah man who fucking knows who knows somebody would ask if she's on farmers only i have no issues looked like a farmer but i just like a normal party girl again at georgia have you brought this girl to the office and said this is my girlfriend
unbeknownst to the story i would have been like oh you guys are married like business like that the girl georgia and marry
oh yeah
it looks like the girl i would marry not the girl i wanna marry
yeah yeah yeah yeah i'd be like
this was one of the funniest shows of all time today
oh yeah did said by the way <unk> shows drops tomorrow night on terry gets legends on drinking <unk> sports
subscribe to that um that is up and we're rocking do drink in pro sports and i'll leave a five star review in a quick reading on that as well on itunes and it'll help moving on up the charts same with ross <unk> revolution leave a review and a five star we
greatly appreciated in all sincerity on this was unbelievably nice which you guys did for for ah in georgia today
it's pretty rad saw no lie the second this ends i'll call and get these tickets right now so you can go tomorrow night um dan is looking like
he's scared don't worry we'll find someone else to take your place if he can't go last minute
i have a feeling this was something that your girlfriend really really wanted to go to you and now now you have to call and say dude you can't go to this
yes she does stand up in austin so
your girlfriend does
grandfather too
that would have been great for her it's a shame the shame
i'll go with dan's girlfriend
guys that's what you should do one hundred percent that what you should do dan you would be okay with that right
but thought she would be like sorry dan
yeah know exactly exactly and i love it i love every second of you
funny way pick up the micro quick so so just lemme ask you here just look at i i georgia does stand up currently i used to do it as started my career like an <unk> doing stand up
i know what it's like when you have your favorite comedians in the world is this show your girlfriends favorite comedian
she really like <unk> i don't she's pretty enough
mid late twenties early thirties gets into like <unk> <unk> i get sleep
yeah um but i suppose it is we you at united talked about this as we saw billboard on saturday noon of which was awesome
ah austin is like the mecca for everything <unk> even james martin was a <unk> fucking <unk> place in <unk>
i know it's <unk>
um this morning on ah <unk> <unk> ah
<unk> ryan
is ryan really on there anymore she's kelly and <unk> made my point
yeah
she really runs that shop um but ah a jessie and i were chatting about it the two best in the world in my opinion are <unk> and <unk> right like that's one and two in the world
yeah for the for the the sole reason of saying whatever like setting their brand very early enough not giving a fuck and literally saying i mean the the the rant that <unk> went on
about women was legendary could he fucking do that if he didn't set that precedent like way back in the day where he is like i don't give a fuck what you to cancel
yeah yeah
cancel me and say miss <unk> they just do it
him it's bringing comedy back right and joe rogan was they would they used to say that about him but he's kind of not write like he's sort of backing off a little bit whereas <unk> and <unk> are going full force no question saying whatever they want
right um
it's so funny your <unk> he did this bit on ah other female kicker from vanderbilt
oh he is fucking great dude
destroyed her for it was it was a like a good <unk> minutes still it was so great
fucking kick was awful
yeah
like what are we fucking targeting
very similar to what i say i want to give the i want to see his go get <unk> just fucking <unk> um it was great ah
but that's the kind of shit i felt
um we should actually sent a camera crew over to your house to have you explain this to her tonight's and then i get along hat <unk> has never shaken his head faster it's so fucking funny
<unk> has his camera ready they could go over
or put her on speaker and then you can you can film that just so you can stay at work <unk>
yeah oh god you are gonna get crucified but if she does stand up and you're not going to <unk> cause he plays like twice a year like fuck
but he's gonna end up saying you can go like i don't need to go you can go and she will not skip a be and be like
yup
thank you that was the right thing to do good bye
and a chance i'm going
okay spoil i mean like plot twist i thought he was
the beauty of it was too as the ah <unk> when he opened up he is like man is like i've only done a handful of shows in like twelve years and it was just like oh you're right
yeah i can dream for that <unk> hundred dollars but
yeah no
realistically yeah i mean we already got a go
if we weren't shadow ben right now i would easily this would like this would this would be easier ins ah but now we have the the hard core amazing non owners who were able to pull this off
richard <unk> is officially my father
oh yeah he adopted you
yeah i think he emailed you paperwork to submit
yeah i have to ah legally change your last name to <unk>
to <unk>
yes yes yes yes yes um this one of the funniest shows of all time ah i yes i know ah it is people asking for you to call your girlfriend live on air right now um brought to you by mint <unk> should we
that is gonna be up to <unk> i'm not in the yeah oh even better
even better han i'm gonna need you to step outside for a minute why it's super important and then get on there and tell her that it'll be great um
he may be on air on saturday she was gonna co <unk> the u f c
perfect and this is what we do here
drama to film it later
already told her i was gonna take her out on friday night
man you guys fucking sieve
it just keeps getting better dude a logo point two dollars called <unk> girlfriend live on air um oh it's so good to i tell you what what tune in during a row sports on saturday night you'll get the full story from <unk> that night um that'll be absolutely fuck
it will be half watch along half how we explained the two girls but the night before we both want to <unk> out
yeah exactly exactly
you
you should ah on your college basketball show you should have around is your special guest to make picks all night and then every single <unk> that <unk> make should be like wrong wrong
she doesn't want talk about basketball she went to kansas state so they just lost to a d two program
seventeen
like yeah there her week just keeps getting worse doesn't it
that's what we do we make dreams happen on here while we crush others um kid <unk> will never play again like
this is a really big decision for <unk> to make
yeah
um i would hate to be in his possession but
it's a pretty easy call
i mean my girl was my girlfriend ah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
play her that audio
yeah keep this entire episode
yeah cause he here's the team with what i was being honest these are front row takes you be in the front row like i wasn't
well we better get on it now
i will not out how calm now but sir this is amazing
this was this was the best show of the year for me the best this is awesome and then we'll have these guys back on to tell us to talk about their experience next week so good ah with the best listeners on the planet for real
um but i'm ross this is jessie but but in all honesty the show is for you guys you guys did this and it's it's amazing so thank you to the <unk> thank you to the <unk> crew ah we love you guys hands up with a lot of stories for you next week
yup dan might be single
good afternoon
good afternoon
hey guys randy with pete's r v t v here today today we're on our way to lone pine <unk> in <unk> bay vermont
we're going to ah show you how to back up a <unk> and put it on the site so ah we'll be there in just a minute and we'll catch up with you then
hey here we are at beautiful lone pine <unk> they're nice enough to let us use the site today so i'm just gonna pull past my site we're going to be on site <unk>
i'm gonna hop out and ah take a look at the site and see where i want to put this <unk> and then we're gonna go right ahead back her on the site
okay so what i've done at this point this is the easiest way to put your <unk> on the site cause i've driven past the site and i've got the site on the driver's side of the truck
i do that on purpose so i can see ah where the slide side or the off door side of the <unk> going
<unk> that is the side that we want to keep as far this way as possible to give us more real estate on the usable part of our site
so if you can all at all do that when you pull up to your <unk> try to keep the driver's side on the on the slide side not all the time you'll be able to do that but if you can ah it's definitely going to work in your benefit
so this point i just kind of walk the site and see what i've got to that i've got to avoid or if there's any trees in the way we see we've got a big stump here i see my power <unk> over here
so i'm gonna wanna keep my <unk> um keep in mind that i've got a slide that's gonna go out but i want to keep my <unk> as far this way as possible to give me as much real estate on that side as i've mentioned before
so this looks like a pretty open site which most <unk> are we've just gotta contend with the stump there
my power cord is gonna be in the back so that will work out perfectly for me so i guess what i'm going to do now is just hop back in the truck and ah see if we can negotiate this guy on the site
okay so i'm gonna pull ahead just a hair and i'm going to ah kind of put the tail on my <unk> headed in the right direction that i want to back this guy up on
now very important at this point is remembering that our wheels are pivot point for our <unk> so that's where the <unk> is gonna turn
so i don't want to watch the front of the <unk> or the back so much i want to keep my eyes on the wheels so here we go
and sometimes when i'm driving a different truck this <unk> working out pretty well but sometimes i'll even angle the mirror down so i can see the wheels a little bit better
want to make sure i got nothing going on on the other side of me
and i'm just letting the <unk> kind of do the job here keeping an eye on both mirrors and obviously turn the steering wheel the opposite way that you want the unit to go
and as you start getting close to where you want to be straight that's when you want to start counter steering
we're getting the unit on there pretty straight nothing on the other side
well i think i'm gonna hit this one pretty good right off the bat
now if you're finding that you're not backing on straight or you know that the <unk> just keeps <unk> on you a little bit
maybe don't have enough room in front of the truck to ah get the truck out where you need it to to get you straight
you always can put the truck back in drive and pull forward and straighten the trailer out
so if you've gone too fat too far past and the <unk> going the wrong way or the the back end of the <unk> is gone too far the way you don't want it to go
simply put the truck in drive and pull straight ahead and that's gonna straighten the unit out for you so we're gonna just back this guy up here
i think i hit my mark
now this is ah the point where if you've watched my ah <unk> video is where you want to get out and check the <unk> for level so that's what we're gonna do right now
okay so that first time went very easy because there's not a whole lot of people in the park so now i'm gonna try to simulate a full park with cars and <unk> on my other side
i'm gonna try to keep my vehicle on the road without going on the lawn over there like i did on the last ah pull in
so this time i'm going to start backing up a little bit sooner
so i've just got my <unk> kind of headed and you can see like with the <unk> headed it's gonna start to turn even with my truck straight
and the <unk> is just starting to turn more and more so i'm gonna compensate just a hair now for it
now i'm really gonna <unk> this <unk>
try to swing this thing around now i can start to turn my truck a little bit
so i've stayed on the road for the most part i've got my <unk> pretty straight
but you see the back of the <unk> still wants to swing around cause i don't have enough room in front of the truck to get to where i want to go
this is where people mostly run into trouble so i've got a trick for this too
by keep backing up my ah back end of my <unk> it's just gonna keep swinging where i don't want it to swing
a lot people will go back and forth and back and forth and they never find that happy spot so what i'm gonna do at this point is i'm just gonna stop the truck right here
and i'm gonna <unk> the <unk> sounds crazy but this would get you out of a pinch in a second
okay so as you can see we turned off the camera um i'm back
i <unk> the truck from the <unk> i <unk> my truck so now my truck is straight in line with the <unk>
and we can continue to back up on the site and now we're not gonna be <unk> or having the <unk> ah off angle on our site because i've now straightened the truck out and that was our problem
so i'm gonna hop back in the truck and finish backing up on the site and we're gonna be good to go here okay so here we go back up for our final destination
you got somebody with you behind you to keep the an eye out not a bad idea
that looks good right about there so at this point i'm gonna get out and ah do a couple of the checks that i like to do just to make sure i've got enough room
ah we know we've got our stump here so i'm gonna do my arm check we've got plenty of room there
i'm right off my electrical box my electrical cords gonna be here so i'm within my twenty-five feet here i think this looks like a great spot
i'm gonna ah run the slide out out and ah put the ah check the levels on the front of the <unk> and see if we're level and then we're gonna take it from there
so in a nutshell a lot of people get intimidated by this it's a really simple process ah don't care about anybody watching me i'm just focused on what i'm doing
does take a little bit of practice you're not gonna hit the mark on the first time out but the more and more you do it and the less you worry about other people watching you the easier it's gonna be for you
so ah just follow my quick steps make sure you watch your wheels watch your mirrors
if you can't get the <unk> exactly where you want <unk> the truck and <unk> the truck and the next time you'll be right on the site right where you want it
so thanks again for watching pete's r v t v with randy today
new segment here for you hopefully this will help with make your camping a little bit easier check out our other videos check out our youtube channel as well as our facebook page we've always got a great information on there as well
so thanks again for watching pete's r v and happy camping
this is a three it's <unk> written and rendered at an extremely low resolution of <unk> by <unk> pixels
but your brain has no trouble recognizing it as a three
and i want you to take a moment to appreciate how crazy it is that brains can do this so effortlessly
i mean this this and this are also recognizable as <unk>
even though the specific values of each pixel is very different from one image to the next
the particular light sensitive cells in your eye that are firing when you see this three are very different from the one's firing when you see this three
but something in that crazy smart visual cortex of yours resolves these as representing the same idea
while at the same time recognizing other images as their own distinct ideas
but if i told you hey sit down and write for me a program that takes in a grid of <unk> by <unk> pixels like this
and out <unk> a single number between zero and ten telling you what it thinks the digit is
all the task goes from <unk> trivial to <unk> difficult
unless you've been living under a rock i think i hardly need to motivate the relevance and importance of machine learning and neural networks
to the present and to the future but what i wanna do here is show you what a neural network actually is
assuming no background and to help visualize what it's doing not as a buzz word but as a piece of math
my hope is just that you come away feeling like the structure itself is motivated
and you feel like you know what it means when you read or you hear about a neural network quote unquote learning
this video is just gonna be devoted to structure component of that and the following one is gonna tackle learning
what we're gonna do is put together a neural network that can learn to recognize hand written digits
this is a some what classic example for introducing the topic
and i'm happy to stick with the status quo here because at the end of the two videos i wanna point you to a couple of good <unk> where you can learn more
and where you can download the code that does this and play with it on you own computer
there are many many variants of neural networks and in recent years there's been sort of a boom in research toward these variants
but in these two introductory videos you and i are just gonna look at the simplest plain vanilla form with no added frills
this is a kind of a necessary <unk> for understanding any of the more powerful modern variants
and trust me it's still has plenty of complexity for us to wrap our minds around
but even in this simplest form it can learn to recognize handwritten digits
which is a pretty cool thing for a computer to be able to do
and at the same time you'll see how it does fall short of a couple hoops that we might have for it
as the name suggests neural networks are inspired by the brain but lets break that down what are the neurons and in what sense are they linked together
right now when i say <unk> all i want you to think about is a thing that holds a number specifically a number between zero and one its really not more then that
for example the network starts with a bunch of neurons <unk> to each of the <unk> times <unk> pixels of the input image
which is seven hundred <unk> neurons in total each one of these hold a number that represents the grey scale value of the corresponding pixel
ranging from zero for black pixels up to one for white pixels this number inside the <unk> is called it's activation
and the image you might have in mind here is that each <unk> is lit up when its activation is a high number
so all of these seven hundred eighty four neurons make up the first layer of our network
now jumping over to the last layer this has ten neurons each representing one of the digits
the activation in these neurons again some number that's between zero and one
represents how much the system thinks that a given image corresponds with the given digit
there's also a couple of layer in between called the hidden layers which for the time being should just be a giant question mark
for how on earth this process of recognizing digits is gonna be handled in this network i choose two hidden layers each one with sixteen neurons
and admittedly that's kind of an arbitrary choice to be honest i choose two layers based on how i wanna motivate the structure in just a moment
and sixteen well that was just a nice number to fit on the screen in practice there is a lot of room for experiment with this specific structure here
the way the network operates <unk> in one layer determine the <unk> of the next layer
and of course the heart of the network as an information processing mechanism comes down to exactly how those <unk> from one layer bring about <unk> in the next layer
it's meant to be loosely analogous to have an biological networks of neurons some groups of neurons firing cause certain others to fire
now the network i'm showing here has already been trained to recognize digits and let me show you what i mean by that
it means if you feed in an image lighting up all seven hundred <unk> neurons of the input layer according to the brightness of the each pixel in the image
that pattern of <unk> causes some very specific pattern in next layer which causes some pattern in the one after it
which finally give some pattern in the output layer and the brightest <unk> of that output layer is the <unk> choice so to speak for what digit this image represents
and before jumping into the math for how one layer influences the next or how training works
let's just talk about why it's even reasonable to expect a layered structure like this to behave intelligently
what are we expecting here what is the best hope for what those middle layers might be doing
well when you or i recognize digits we piece together various components a nine has a loop up top and a line on the ray
and eight also has a loop up top but its paired with another loop download
a four basically breaks down into three specific lines and things like that
now in a perfect world we might hope that each <unk> in the second to last layer corresponds with one of these sub components
that any time you feed in an image with say a loop up top like a nine or an eight there is some specific <unk> whose activation is gonna be close to one
and i don't mean this specific loop of pixels the hope would be that any generally <unk> pattern towards the top sets off this <unk>
that way going from the third layer to the last one just requires learning which combination of <unk> corresponds to which digits
of course that just kicks the problem down the road because how would you recognize these sub components who even learn what the right sub components should be
and i still haven't even talked about how one layer influences the next but run with me on this one for a moment recognizing a loop can also break down into sub problems
one reasonable way to do this would be the first recognize the various little edges that make it up
similarly a long line like the kind you might seeing the digit one or four or seven well that's really a long edge or may be you think if it a certain pattern of several smaller edges
so maybe our hope is that each <unk> in the second layer of the network corresponds with the various relevant little edges
maybe when an image like this one comes in it lights up all of the neurons associated with the around eight to ten specific little edges
which in turn lights up the neurons associated with the upper loop and a long vertical line and those light up the <unk> associated within nine
whether or not this is what our final network actually does is another question when that i'll come back to once we see how to train the network
but this is a hope that we might have a sort of goal with the layered structure like this
more over you can imagine how being able to detect edges and patterns like this would be really useful for other image recognition tasks
and even beyond image recognition there are all sort of intelligent things you might wanna do that breaks down into layers of abstraction
parsing speech for example involves taking raw audio in picking out distinct sounds which combine to make certain syllables
which combine to form words which combine to make up phrases and more <unk> dots et cetera
but getting back to how any of this actually works picture yourself right now designing how exactly the <unk> in one layer might determine the <unk> in the next
the goal is to have some mechanism that could conceivably combine pixels into edges or edges into patterns or patterns into digits
and to zoom in on one very specific example but say the hope is for one particular <unk> in the second layer
to pickup on whether or not the image has an edge in this region here
the question at hand is what parameters should the network have what dials and <unk> should you be able to tweak
so that it's expressive enough to potentially capture this pattern or any other pixel pattern or the pattern that several edges can make a loop and other such things
what will we do is assign a weight to each one of the connections between our <unk> and the neurons from the first layer
these weights are just numbers then take all those <unk> from the first layer and compute their weighted sum according to these weights
i find it helpful to think of these weights is being organized into a little grid of their own and i'm gonna use green pixels to indicate positive weights and red pixels to indicate negative weights
where the brightness of that pixel is some loose depiction of the <unk> value
now if we made the weights associate with almost all of the pixels zero <unk> for some positive weights in this region that we care about
then taking the weighted sum of all the pixel values really just amounts to adding up the values of the pixel just in the region that we care about
and if you really wanted to pickup on whether there's an edge here what you might do is have some negative weights associated with the surrounding pixels
then the sum is largest when those middle pixels are bright but the surrounding pixels are darker
when you compute a weighted sum like this you might come out with any number but for this network what we want is <unk> is to be some value between zero and one
so a come thing to do is to pump this weight at sum in to some function that <unk> the real number line into the range between zero and one
and a common function that does this is called the <unk> function also known as the <unk> curve
basically very negative inputs end up close to zero very positive inputs end up close to one and it just steadily increases around the input zero
so the activation of the <unk> here is basically in measure of how positive the relevant weighted sum is
but maybe it's not that you want the <unk> to light up when the weight at sum is bigger then zero maybe you only want it to be active when the sum is bigger then say ten
that is you want some bias for it to be inactive
what we do then is just add in some other number like negative ten to this weight at sum before plugging at through the <unk> <unk> function
that additional number is called the bias
so the weights tell you what pixel pattern this <unk> in the second layer is picking up on and the bias tells you how high the weighted sum needs to be
before the <unk> starts getting <unk> active
and that is just one <unk> every other <unk> in this layer is gonna be connected to all seven hundred eighty four pixel neurons from the first layer
and each one of those seven hundred eighty four connections has it's own weight associated with it
also each one has sum bias some other number that you add on to the weighted sum before <unk> it with the <unk>
and that's a lot to think about
with this hidden layer of sixteen neurons that's a total of seven hundred eighty four times sixteen weights along with sixteen biases
and all of that is just a connections from the first layer to the second the connections between the other layers also have a bunch of weights and biases associated with them
all said and done this network has almost exactly thirteen thousand total weights and biases
thirteen thousand <unk> and dials they can be <unk> and turn to make this network behave in different ways
so when we talk about learning what that's referring to is getting the computer to find a valid setting for all of these many many numbers so that it will actually solve the problem in hand
one thought experiment that is a one's fun and kind a horrifying is to image sitting down and setting all of these weights and biases by hand
purposely tweaking the numbers so that the second layer picks up on edges the third layer picks up on patterns et cetera
i personally find this satisfying rather then just treating the network as a total black box
because when the network doesn't perform the way you anticipate
if you built up a little bit of relationship with what those weights and biases actually mean you have a starting place for experimenting with how to change the structure to improve
or when the network does work but not for the reasons you might expect digging into what the weights and biases are doing is a good way to challenge your assumption
and really expose the full space of possible solutions
by the way the actual function here is a little come per sum to write down don't you think
so let me show you an more <unk> compact way that these connections are represented this is how you'd see if you choose to read at more about neural networks
organize all of the <unk> from one layer into a column as a vector
then organize all of the weights as a matrix where each row of that matrix corresponds to the connection between one layer and a particular <unk> in the next layer
what that means is that taking the weight at sum of the <unk> in the first layer according to these weights
corresponds to one of the terms in the matrix vector product of everything we have on the left here
by the way so much of machine learning just comes down to having a good grasp of linear algebra
so for any of you who want a nice visual understanding from <unk> and what matrix vector multiplication means take a look at the series i did on linear algebra especially chapter three
back to our expression instead of talking about adding the bias to each one of these values independently
we represent it by organizing all those biases into a vector and adding the entire vector to the previous matrix vector product
then as a final step i wrap a <unk> around the outside here
and what that suppose to represent is that you are gonna apply the <unk> function to each specific component of the resulting vector inside
so once you write down this weight matrix and these vectors as their own symbols you can communicate the full transition of <unk> for one layer to the next
and in an extremely tight and neat little expression
and this makes the relevant code both a lot simpler and a lot faster since many libraries optimize the hack out of matrix multiplication
remember how earlier i said these neurons are simply things that hold numbers well of course the specific numbers that they hold depends on the image you feed in
so it's actually more accurate to think of each <unk> as a function when it takes in the outputs of all neurons in the previous layer and spits out a number between zero and one
really the entire network is just a function when they takes in seven hundred <unk> numbers as an input and spits out ten numbers as an output
it's an absurdly complicated function one that involves thirteen thousand <unk> in the forms of these weights and biases that pick up on certain patterns
and which involves <unk> many matrix vector products and the <unk> <unk> function
but it's just the function nonetheless and in a way it's kind of reassuring that it looks complicated
i mean if it were any simpler what hope would we have that it can take on the challenge of recognizing digits and how does it take on that challenge
how does this network learn the appropriate weights and biases just by looking at data oh that's what i'll show in the next video
and i'll also dig a little more in to what this particular network we are seeing is really doing
now is the point i suppose i should say subscribe to stay notified about when that video or any new videos come out
but realistically most of you don't actually receive notifications from youtube do you
may be more honestly i should say subscribe so that the neural networks that <unk> <unk> recommendation algorithm
are primed to believe that you want to see content from this channel get recommended to you any way stay posted for more
thank you very much to everyone supporting these videos on patron
i've been a little slow to progress in the probability series this summer but i'm jumping back into it after this project so <unk> you can look out for updates there
to close things off here i have with me <unk> lee who did her <unk> work on the theoretical side of deep learning
and who currently works at venture capital firm called amplify partners who kindly provided some of the funding for this video
so <unk> one thing i think we should quickly bring up is this <unk> function
as i understand it early network use this to <unk> the relevant weight at sum into that interval between zero and one
you know kinda motivated by the biological analogy of neurons either being inactive or active
exactly
but relatively few modern networks actually use <unk> anymore that's kind of old school right
yeah or rather value seems be much easier to train
and <unk> <unk> stands for <unk> linear unit
yes it's it's kind of function we use to taking a max and zero
and a or a is given by what you're explaining in the video
and what this was sort of motivated from i think was a partially by a biological analogy with how neurons would either be activated
or not and so if it passes the certain thresholds it would be the ingenuity function but if it did not then it would just not be activated so be it zero so it's kind of a simplification
using <unk> didn't help training or it was very difficult to train at at some point and people just tried value
and it happen to work very well for these incredibly um deep ah neural networks
alright thank you <unk>
for background amplify partners and early stage of e c invest in technical founders building the next generation of companies focused on the applications of a i
if you or some one that you know has ever thought about starting a company someday or if you are working on an early stage one right now the amplify folks would love to hear from you
they even setup a specific email for this video three blue and brown at amplify partners dot com so feel free to reach out to them through that
hey you all my name is corey ash and and i know that you have been working really hard to try to figure out
how to track all of those different points of advertisement that are bringing traffic to your wordpress website right
you've been looking and thinking okay that e-mail campaign that i did i can see that it was opened at this rate
and i can see even which users opened them and i can even see how many clicked on something
but how do i know which one of those actually drew in the cell at the end of the day right
how do we follow the <unk> journey all the way through our website and know which facebook campaign actually converted better how are you tracking those things
well there's actually a free tool that you can use to do it i'm gonna show you how to do it all right now
hey you guys this is brought to you by liquid web the most helpful humans in hosting if you need help with your wordpress website would you please reach out to them
i love them because of their incredible support they've actually won awards for their legendary support so if you need help understanding how to use a plug-in
understanding what a website performance and how to improve that website security how to run a better <unk> shop they can absolutely help you with their phenomenal support team
alright let's get to the tutorial it's time to learn about u t m codes so if you've ever seen a u r l path that looks like this
this has u t m tracking inside of it
u t m is urgent tracking module you've also probably heard it called tracking parameters or tracking tags
these u t m tags allow us to track five different things i'm gonna walk you through those look like
but lets break down this u r l first so you kind of understand what you're looking at
obviously this right here is the route domain name or the page that you want this link to go to
then you've got a u t m source living inside of here this is the first perimeter that we're using
we're asking for the source of this particular link traffic right
where did my traffic come from where's the source of this traffic where were we using this link
this says news letter you can track all sorts of stuff here's another u t m perimeter saying the u t m medium is the e-mail
the u t m campaign is the s e o tips and the u t m content is the call to action button you've got five different <unk> that you can track
those five different <unk> are campaign source campaign medium campaign name campaign term
and campaign content now this particular resource that i'm giving you is actually the free recourse that helps you build those u r <unk>
easily and quickly they type it all in for you and make it certain that you don't miss any characters whatsoever all you have to do is answer the questions and kind of fill in the blanks here
and it'll start to build it for you so let me walk you through first of all what they are and then i'll build a sample u r l it's like campaign source
this is required if we're gonna use any u t <unk> this is the base one that would be required the medium is required and the campaign name
and in the term and the content would be optional but the campaign source ah is used to identify the search engine
news letter name or other source example google right so we're gonna do an example up here using facebook the campaign medium
this is the u t m medium uses to identify the e-mail or maybe the cost per click
whatever medium is being used inside of that source so for us it's just gonna be a regular post that we're going to do right
and then this is also the one that's required the u t m campaign this is used to identify a specific product or promotion or strategic campaign
so the example that they're giving here is spring cell so you can use something if you're running a certain campaign for donations
or for a particular product that you wanna highlight
the campaign term would be to note a key word for this ad so if you're trying to go after a specific key term you can add that inside of there
and then the campaign content i think this one is really key to use as well
because this one allows you to differentiate between ads or links if they're in the same type of document
so for like an e-mail campaign if you have different links
you can track the specific link inside that document ah that brought you the most traffic so it's a really cool tool here
let's go up here and build one out and i'll show you how to use it so website u r l this is the link that you want them to land on so if you have an internal landing page
this can go anywhere to a active link online the campaign source for us right now i'm gonna go ahead and use facebook
the campaign medium so this is cost per click banner e-mail you can put whatever you want to inside of there i'm actually going to list the facebook page
i'm gonna put this on so i can track whichever page this is coming from so i'm gonna say this is coming from ash corey page
and the campaign name remember these are the required three fields that you have to have after your u r l
so we've got to fill it out and put something in there that makes sense for us is this a product is this a promo code is there a slogan
what do we need to put in here to help us again better understand where this traffic is coming from i'm gonna put on here s e o tips
and then you can add in key words and you can add in campaign content if you wanna differentiate those ads
and for this one i am gonna go ahead and say that this one was an organic ad that basically i didn't promote
this is just an organic ad that i was ah just gonna post on my facebook page that's it you guys it has built out the link for me
now here's the cool part we can take that link and use it like a regular link anywhere you want anywhere
on any social network inside of twitter whatever we want it if we need to have a shorter link you can do that
and you do have to have authorization required so basically you just need to log in create an account
but for free we can grab this link right here and we're off and running we can put that behind a text link behind an image
ah we can put it in a post it doesn't matter we can use it anywhere we want and it allows us to completely track where that traffic came from
so let's take that link and jump into our facebook here i am inside of my facebook page for corey ash
and you can come down here and just like you would and adding in any other regular link you'd be adding it here
and these say something like check out my tool box for really great s e o tools
and tips and i'm <unk> in that u r l
yes it looks lengthy and that's fine people are still gonna click on it it's no big deal but look it's gonna render it just like it normally would it brought over everything brought over my image brought over the <unk> it
and it's going to work perfectly lets go ahead and scroll down here and click post
and then what we wanna do is we wanna click on it and jump over to that website and see how it's gonna bring it over in the path and help us land in that exact spot
that we wanted to bring that traffic to check this out
there is here click
out we go
there's my tool box let me pull this down so you can sneak a peak at that path look at that you guys it brought over that whole beautiful link
so now that <unk> gonna be showing inside of my google analytics and i can pull that and source that any which way to better understand where all my traffic is coming from
so as you can see you can resource that free google tool create those little extensions on to your regular domain link
right whatever u r l you already have you just tack in on there and you're off and running you guys you can track anything whether you're doing it for yourself
or you're helping a client set that up where the clients now know and have that clarity of exactly which campaign they're running converts perfectly
and you can do that with a lot of different tools again totally for free just like the one i showed you how cool is that i hope this helps you if you're interested in more stuff like this
i've got over four hundred videos on this youtube channel be sure to check them out put a comment in the description box below i'd love to talk to you
let me know how you're using this tracking and how it's worked for you alright hope this helps you out i will see you all next wordpress wednesday please be sure to like and subscribe bye you guys

in this video i'm gonna show you how you can automatically share out your facebook lives across multiple channels the moment that you're live without any manual work
hey it's justin brown here from primal video we release a ton of content to help you get better results with your videos faster
if you're new here then make sure you click that big subscribe button and all the links to everything that we cover in this video you can find linked in the description box below so let's jump into it
how many times have you received a notification that someone that you're following is live only to join that live session
and what they're doing is sharing out the live stream to other social media platforms so sharing it to their facebook group or to a page or to any other social media
the time to capture your audience when you're running a live stream is immediately
you don't wanna have to make your audience wait just wait a minute while i share this out to my page to my group to to my twitter account you need to capture your audience straightaway
well now there is a way to automate this process so that you're not losing those precious first seconds from your true fans that jump on immediately when you're live
in this video i'm gonna show you the tool you need to do it and take you through step by step how you can set it up for maximum results across multiple platforms
and stick around to the end cause i'm also gonna share with you another tool that we use to help notify our subscribers long before our live streams even start
okay so now onto this amazing facebook live automation tool it was actually introduced to me by a good friend of mine jason <unk> so make sure you check him out at jason <unk> dot com
but the tool is called live leap and again all the links to everything that we're talking about here you can find linked in the description below
live leap is an awesome service that <unk> out your facebook lives the moment that you go live
to places like facebook groups facebook pages to twitter to linkedin accounts out through email and s m s as well
so in order for you to reach all of these different areas or different audiences without live leap it would take you a long time once you went live
so to automate this whole process is just amazing so this is a real game changer when it comes to facebook live as far as i'm concerned
there is no other way to automatically syndicate your facebook live out across all of these different platforms but even internally just in facebook
to share it out automatically to a facebook group a page or multiple groups or multiple pages the instant you go live is really really powerful
so to set this up you will need to create an account and they do have a one dollar seven day trial period
so you can try it for seven days for one dollar and again check out the links in the description below so once you've created your live leap account you'll need to sign in using your facebook account
once you're in this is what you're presented with this is the live leap dashboard
now on the left hand side here is the main menu so if we click on live broadcast that'll show you all your previous broadcasts that you've syndicated out using live leap
but the next one down facebook route manager is where the magic happens and this is where you can set up routes or where you want your facebook lives to be syndicated out to
so we'll create a new rule here a new route so this page is the first step here in this <unk> setup process
and this is where we set up share broadcasts from these pages so we'll give it a name share justin live
do you wanna share the live videos that you publish from your personal profile
yes which facebook pages would you like to share your live videos from
now if you only wanna share your live videos out and syndicate them from your personal profile then that's all you'll need to pick
if you wanna syndicate out when you go live to a page that you're an admin on or a manager on as well then you can pick those pages here
so will syndicate out our live streams from our primal video facebook page as well so i'll select that one and choose next
now share to these pages and groups where do we want these to go do you want to share live videos to your personal profile
so if we turn this on even though we already had our personal profile ticked on the page before
this means that if we go live on either our personal profile or the page that will be syndicated to the other as well and likewise
what pages would we like to syndicate our facebook live to
justin brown primal video we'll send it there as well when we go live so that way if we're live on our personal profile it's gonna go to the page if we're live on the page it's gonna go to the profile
so you can already see the level of control you get over this <unk> you can pick multiple pages if you need to to really share your live streams out
and here you can also choose which groups you want to share your live videos to
so if you're an admin on a group or a group owner then you'll have the choice to pick your groups down the bottom here
we go next next up we can select the networks outside of facebook that we wanna broadcast and syndicate our facebook lives to
so you can see we've got twitter and linkedin here and you need to connect your account first by clicking the click here to connect your account on both twitter and linkedin if you want
you can see i've already got ah my twitter linked up justin brown p v if i wanna broadcast to there then i'll enable that here
and exactly the same for linkedin you'll have to connect your account if you wanna broadcast to linkedin as well then hit next
now this is where it gets really interesting and something that you don't see too often you can actually share your facebook live broadcast out via s m s
so you can upload a c s v file with your s m s contacts or an email list
so you can upload your email address list into this area as well and if we just click on that now you can see that it's looking for a c s v file
so we'll skip that one for now and the last integrations you get here you can send live notifications to websites and multiple websites
so we can click here and add a website you'll go through name your website give all your links you can set what the <unk> going to look like
then you paste this code into your website so whenever you're live there's a notification that pops up on your website
saying that you're live as well so that is really powerful so you can see here that i've got this set up on our <unk> dot com website so i can enable that here now too
and the last one here is <unk> integration so if you've got any <unk> that are set up for any services or any other platforms that you're running
then you can set those up in here as well and once you've got all that set up just click finish and that's it it really that simple
now it's set up so any time i go live on either my personal profile or a facebook page you can see here share from personal profile
or one facebook page which was the primal video facebook page it's going to share to personal it's gonna share to that facebook primal video page
it's also gonna share to my twitter and to our primal video website as well
now you can have multiple pages multiple groups multiple twitter accounts and multiple websites in here as well the only thing you can't have <unk> of is personal accounts
your live leap account is linked here to your personal facebook profile so at this point you can't broadcast to multiple profiles
but really who has multiple profiles anyway and even more advanced than this is you can create multiple routes you can see we've just got one here
we can have multiple routes to broadcast different things out to different platforms and different areas so it's really powerful
the only other settings you've got in here are advanced settings for email and for text and s m s settings as well
so you can see here you can link it up to your <unk> account through a <unk> a p i and that will be how it's sending the <unk> out and more advanced settings for your s m s broadcast as well
but if you're not worried about s m s or e-mail then you can ignore these altogether the key area that you wanna set up here is the facebook route manager
now the last thing that you're probably wondering is this sounds amazing how much does it actually cost i know i can get a seven day trial for a dollar but how much does it cost to keep using it
well there's two plans there's a basic plan at nineteen dollars per month which is going to do what most people would be after and there's a pro plan at <unk> dollars per month
the main difference between the two plans is the number of users you can have you've got one user on the basic plan and three users on the pro plan
you'll have more advanced training on the pro plan as well and it's got alpha access to page builder
and it says the page builder automatically creates video replay pages and has a variety of features for marketing
so if you're interested in that then the pro plan is for you if not at least start out with the basic nineteen dollars per month and that would do most things that you're after
but grab the one dollar seven day trial and see how this works for you
i can guarantee you you won't be disappointed this is really a game changing service that's going to change the way people create their facebook lives
so that's how you can set up the automatic <unk> of your facebook lives
to go out to multiple facebook groups multiple facebook pages ah multiple platforms twitter linkedin your website all using live leap
now the other tool that i mentioned earlier in the video that we use to notify our subscribers our fans our followers
that we're going to go live before we're actually live is called send calendar
the best way to to get people in and attending your facebook lives is to give them as much notice as you can and that's what send calendar allows you to do
it allows you to get your live streams into their calendar so it's their calendar on their phone on their computer
that's their business calendar that they're using every day to schedule their everyday lives
if you can get your live streams into there then it's highly likely they'll show up and attend your live stream
we did do a video on send calendar a little while back and i'll link it up in the cards now so make sure you check it out
if you wanna see how powerful it is getting your live streams into your <unk> calendars
if you found this video helpful then make sure you click on the big subscribe button if you haven't already and give this video a thumbs up
and check out the video linked on screen now on ways to maximize your live streaming attendance i'll see you soon
in this video i'll show you how to download facebook videos on iphone and ipad including your facebook lives directly into the gallery on your device
hey it's justin brownie from primal video where we help you amplify your business and brand with video if you're new here make sure you click that subscribe button and all the links to everything we mentioned in this video
you can find linked in the description box below so let's jump into it now if you've got videos on facebook including your facebook live streams that you'd like to download
and <unk> from your iphone or ipad unfortunately the process is not as straight forward as it can be but the good news is there are a few options to do it
to make it a run through the best ones right now now each option does have it's own advantages and disadvantages so stick around to make sure that you're using the best option for you
so the first option i'm gonna take you through is solely going to use your iphone or your ipad with no need to use a computer or a laptop
to be able to help in the process okay so first step is to open up facebook and to go and find the videos that you want to download
so for this i'm just gonna go to our primal video page
and i'll come across youtube videos find the video that i want to download let's say it's this one here it's not too late to grow on youtube let's press on that
and i'm gonna need to grab the link for that video so we come down to share as if we're gonna share this out come down to more options and you wanna choose copy
so that we're copying the link to that video next you come across to the app store and make sure you have firefox installed
so firefox is an alternative web browser to google chrome or safari but the biggest difference is that firefox will let you download these videos
from that video link so you can see i've already got it installed so i'm just gonna hit open on this and firefox is totally free and it is safe to download and install and have on your device
so the next thing i'm wanna do is to open up firefox and head over to one of these two websites
either f p download dot i o or f p down dot net currently these are the two most popular ones and either one of them is going to give you great result
my personal preference is f p download dot i o so i'm gonna hit that now and all we need to do is to paste that link that we've just copied into this text field here
so we press and hold and then hit paste there is our video link that we had copied we press download and we wait a few seconds
as it is generating our download link please wait and as we scroll down here you can see all the different options we've got for downloading our videos
we get the choice of whether we want the h d version and s d version or one of the lower quality versions or even a video army so it's normally gonna be the top one you want that's normally the best quality
and you can see the file size there sixteen point <unk> meg is much higher than a lot of the other one's there so that's the one that we want we just press and hold on that download button
and then we get the option here to download link so if we press on download link the then get the option here to download the file so we press download now
it's gonna go through and it's going to download that file okay so you can see that the file has finished downloading now so if we press on downloads so what you wanna do is press on that because its currently not gonna show up
in our camera roll or in our gallery so we wanna press on that and then we wanna choose save video and that's now gonna save it across into our photos
so we can come back here to photos and you see that the video is in there now
so that's option one and you can see how easy it is to download your videos directly into your ipad or into your iphone just using that firefox app
now this will only work for videos that are public on facebook
if they are inside of a closed or private group then this option may not work or if the privacy is set to not be public then this isn't going to work either
now all this method does that you download a decent quality version of video from facebook it's not the best quality that you can get
in order to get the best quality videos downloaded from facebook you're gonna want to use your mac or your p c and you wanna download the file on there
and then transfer it across to your iphone or ipad i'm gonna show you this method now now the best tool i found to do this is called <unk> toolbox
and it's available for both mac and windows does cause nineteen dollars <unk> for the year for a subscription to this software but it is so much more
than just video downloading software so we're bringing it up now you can see other options for do not disturb mode a presentation mode you've got the ability to hide your desktop
if you're gonna be doing a screen share or a screen recording you can remove all the <unk> and mess on your desktop to make it look cleaner you've got an airplane mode you've got options in here to clean up your hard drive
you've got a video converter in here an animated <unk> or <unk> maker there's a heap of tools in here and these guys are actively adding new ones
in here all the time but the one that we're talking about here is the download video tool and this is about <unk> when you open it so what you wanna do first is just check that your settings are set up
accordingly you can see here you can choose the preferred quality i would recommend that you gonna leave it on max or maximum available but you can also select lower quality versions
as well if you are downloading a non m <unk> video so a video that's in a different file format you can have it
download and convert into an m <unk> all within this app as well so for us we're gonna download without conversion
those get to specify your download location so here i'm on a mac it's just gonna go to downloads we'll hit done and i'll show you how this works
so i wanna come across to that same facebook page at facebook page let's pick the same video it's not too late to grow on youtube we'll select that
let's pause it so it doesn't play now we need to do here is to grab that link again so here we don't need to hit share it's actually at the top here the u r l we can just copy that
or if you're not seeing that you can right click on any video and choose show video u r l and this is the link here so you wanna select that right click and choose copy
or press control c or command c to copy that link you don't wanna come back to <unk> toolbox and then all we need to do is hit paste
and that's going to download that video for us
you can see here the file size is a little bit larger at seventeen point five mega bites so it is slightly better quality and then you can see that your download is completed down here
on your computer and downloads or wherever it is that you've set it to save so from there once you've got the file saved on your computer all you need to do is to transfer it
over to your iphone or ipad we've got a video linked up in the cards showing you three different methods on how you can do it but it really can be as easy as if you're on a mac
and on an iphone just use <unk> and just send it to your self <unk> or you could use something like <unk> google drive or dropbox
to easily transfer that file to yourself so that's how easy it is to download your facebook videos onto your iphone or ipad
now if you're interested in <unk> your video content across to other platforms and even converting some of your videos into a portrait format
for places like i g t v then check out the video linked on screen now for a full walk through on how to do it plus an overview of all the options available to you
i'll see you in the next one
hey guys what's up it's j r <unk> and in this video we're gonna be talking about the <unk> three the first cube since <unk> to be named after a speed <unk>
the vision for the <unk> three has brought about by mats <unk> who is the former three by three single world record holder and the third place winner of u s nationals this year
the cube was designed by <unk> <unk> and was approved by mats <unk> of course the cube is his main but let's see how the cube actually performs and whether it's right for you
the ball three is on the price here side of things its about twenty dollars and if you opt for the <unk> premium version like i did it's gonna be <unk> dollars
the cube in this review will be the premium <unk> three and i haven't changed the <unk> at all i've just tighten the tensions a little bit if you wanna see how the premium <unk> three is prepared the link will be in the description
if you wanna check that out anyways moving on the <unk> three measures <unk> point five millimeters across <unk> i kinda feel like that was planned a little bit
but i guess we'll never know for sure the stock stickers are labeled as the <unk> half bright shades but they're pretty much identical to <unk> half <unk>
which if you guys didn't know were the shades that everyone used to use before the <unk> stickers became popular so let's talk about turning
out of the box the <unk> three reminded me of <unk> a bit when i opened up the cubes to compare the mechanisms i was actually very surprised to see that they were almost identical seemingly
even <unk> posted some photos of the <unk> and the <unk> three next to each other and the mechanisms look pretty much the same
but <unk> then went on to post some more photos and explained some more of the subtle differences between the two cubes
and of course feeling a broken a <unk> and in broken <unk> three they're pretty much nothing alike the <unk> three is pretty much entirely smooth there are no bumps or anything along the turn
it's just completely smooth it's also a very light and very fast very little effort is required to start turn so the cube is best suited for a light accurate turn style
when turning fast the cube does become a bit <unk> and has a very rigid feel in general the cube is easy to control on tight tensions but sometimes i do loose control and <unk>
causing a lock up although this mostly happens when i'm <unk> tps in the last layer so i've had to learn to control my speed to help with <unk>
and in general i've just had to adjust my turning style quite a bit to do well in this cube since i've been using the <unk> v two as my main i would say i've adapted more of a <unk> turn style
as the <unk> v two is very forgiving but it's also not super fast so you can turn very rough and you won't lock up basically
but if you use that turn style with a <unk> it just locks up completely so i've had to work on adjusting my turn style to be a bit slower a little bit more precise
but with a bit of practice i've been able to get my times back down to what they usually are and i pretty much stopped getting lock ups the corner cutting on the <unk> is up to par with any modern speed cube
although i did notice after tightening the tensions it was much harder to cut past forty-five same with reverse but smaller cuts were just fine
the cube however just feels a bit more rigid and sturdy than other three by <unk> which i really like its a very stable puzzle it's just not as forgiving as some other three by <unk>
popping and corner twisting of course never happened on this cube those are two things that really don't even need to be talked about in reviews anymore ah because pretty much all cubes have those traits
overall the performance of the <unk> three is really really good but there are just a few things that bug me about it um i'm just not a huge fan of first of all the size
ah <unk> point five millimeters is just a little too small for me i do prefer <unk> millimeter cubes ah mainly because my hands are really big
and i actually found my fingers getting caught on the layers sometimes especially doing m turns i just noticed that to happen it's not that big of a deal though
um but it's just something i noticed second is the completely smooth turning i prefer cubes that are little bit more <unk> and a little slower
the cube just <unk> so effortlessly it's kinda hard to control sometimes this is another one that i've gotten used to over time and i'm starting to actually enjoy now ah but i still thought i'd bring it up
finally the squared off corners now i say this in every review i don't really like squared off corners for me they just cause too much catching and i don't really corner twist either way
so it's not really an advantage for me but this cube in particular i felt has a bigger catching issue
i'm not sure why but i noticed the corner catching on the center more often than with other squared off corner puzzles i just think that if the corners were rounded off all of the catching problems would pretty much disappear
once again i've pretty much gotten used to it but i would still prefer if they weren't there overall the <unk> three is an extremely solid cube
the performance is really top of the line and my problems with it are really just more minor <unk> the <unk> has huge potential in my opinion to be one of the best
if not the best speed cubes you can buy it honestly surprises me that i'm saying that this cube has gotten me some new personal best and it's getting closer and closer to beating my <unk>
i can't say for sure that i'll make it my main as i still do have some mixed feelings about it but i think you should absolutely give this cube a shot if you've been on the fence about it
and if you can afford it definitely get the premium version it's set up perfectly and i haven't had any problems with it but anyway that's all i've gotta say about the <unk> <unk> <unk> three
if you wanna purchase this cube the link will be in the description down below thanks to the <unk> for making this video possible if you guys like this video give it a like and if you haven't already done so

released by square <unk> in two thousand and seven on the playstation portable director <unk> <unk> and writer <unk> <unk> worked together to create a <unk> of final fantasy seven for it's tenth anniversary
the game sets up the world and role of many characters from the main game and focuses on developing several figures such as <unk> <unk> <unk> and key members of <unk>
the story and game player done solely from the perspective of <unk> and features full voice acting for combat random encounters are utilized while actual combat is similar to the kingdom heart's menu based real time system
mechanics such as the equipment and material system have the <unk> over hauled and removed to reduce player <unk> and instead contribute to the main battle <unk> the digital mind wave
the d m w is a continuously spinning slot machine system that <unk> various bonuses effects and attacks based on the results including how <unk> levels up
the campaign is progressed through missions the player can select at their own pace or complete side <unk> instead traveling instantly to many fully <unk> areas and dungeons with no need for an over world map
the story only gets larger from here so it's cut it down to size with a <unk>
the game begins with <unk> fair soldier second class of the group called soldier a private military army owned by the <unk> electric power company in the city of <unk>
he completes a training exercise under the mentorship of his friend and commander <unk> a first class soldier
<unk> has tremendous skills and talent but is unfortunately a little over confident reckless at times as pointed out by his fellow soldier another first class named <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> as a hero and <unk> to one day be at his level but he's not ready yet despite this <unk> only being part of the training simulation
<unk> helps him out reminding him to temper his aspirations with passionate dreams and steadfast honor
<unk> hears from a fellow soldier of the mass desertion of troops in soldier and he's soon called in to speak with the director of soldier a man named <unk>
he's briefed about soldier first class genesis who went missing during a mission in <unk> an independent country to the west against whom <unk> company is personally leveraging its military might
<unk> is to pick up the mission in his place as a test for soldier first class per <unk> recommended promotion
<unk> <unk> <unk> on this mission as they are to bring down the last <unk> for <unk> and <unk> can complete its mission for economic world domination
<unk> notes <unk> massive sword the buster sword is rarely used which <unk> <unk> admit he's rather stingy with though does end up using it when his friend is in trouble
during the mission he encounters it free and while he manages to just hold him off he's amazed to be rescued by his idol <unk>
investigates some fallen troops that don't belong to <unk> its revealed they bear identical faces to genesis the missing soldier
suddenly <unk> goes missing and <unk> suspects he too has betrayed them and deserted though <unk> <unk> denies it
after the mission director <unk> confirms <unk> really is gone for unknown reasons but <unk> <unk> on a new mission
he's to investigate what happened with two missing agents that went in to check around <unk> hometown
in addition he <unk> <unk> other turks <unk> elite operative and espionage unit to cooperate on this mission
heading to <unk> village which was also <unk> hometown <unk> finds and beats a few more genesis <unk>
<unk> explains this technology was stolen from <unk> which allowed genesis to implant his abilities and strength on other soldier members or monsters
originally it was to clone their best soldiers to makeup for the low numbers they currently have but <unk> is more keen to know that this <unk> that soldiers and monsters are fundamentally and biologically the same
moving on <unk> informs <unk> that <unk> and genesis were childhood best friends that grew up together which is why <unk> thinks they are in <unk> with their desertion
finding <unk> mother gillian she notes <unk> is the restless puppy <unk> often spoke about and she tells him genesis came by a month ago with an army of <unk> and proceeded to start killing <unk>
she also lets <unk> know <unk> did come by here and left his prized sword behind which she explains represents his family's honor
it turns out genesis killed his parents and <unk> makes a plea to be given a chance to talk with <unk> and see about convincing him and genesis to come back
<unk> sees now <unk> passion is why <unk> who was originally assigned this mission but refused chose <unk> to take his place
he was actually counting on <unk> to bring back <unk> and genesis his only friends in this world they discovered genesis but he beats them back and <unk> <unk>
<unk> discovers <unk> standing over a dead gillian and is simply confused by the entire situation
summoning <unk> to distract and settle down a frustrated <unk> both genesis and <unk> choose to turn their back on <unk> while asking how long <unk> himself can stand living on that side
afterwards genesis reveals they are all monsters quite literally as he <unk> a single large black wing proclaiming this means they have no honor dreams anymore he flies off
refusing to believe that soldier means monster <unk> is interrupted as <unk> launches an air strike to wipe the town of <unk> off the map ensuring no witnesses to this event
soon after <unk> wins the war with <unk> and has every city in the world under its thumb now
time passes and <unk> is greeted by <unk> personally as he is promoted to soldier first class officially though attaining this dream of his seems <unk>
however duty calls and he's assigned a new mission after <unk> up in his new black uniform he's told a kill command has been issued for <unk> genesis and the clone army
unfortunately <unk> cannot be trusted due to his relationship to <unk> and even <unk> holds his own thoughts on the issue
suddenly they're interrupted as the building is under attack and <unk> works along side turks <unk> rude and <unk> as they take out more genesis <unk>
<unk> encounters genesis himself but is soon overwhelmed and <unk> rescues her and <unk> his punishing assault in a one on one dual
as he strikes down genesis he gets a call from <unk> who's located <unk>
he tells <unk> to hurry over before the <unk> army arrives so they can help their mutual friend escape and <unk> is happy to help
however when he arrives and destroys a new monster he's shocked to see a bears <unk> face on it
as <unk> talks more with <unk> he <unk> more how <unk> genesis and himself were close friends and even though <unk> himself was the company's prized war hero genesis himself wanted such prestige as well
even when they would train in the company's training room <unk> could hold his own against both <unk> and genesis though when genesis got serious not even his friend <unk> could calm him down
even then <unk> was the better fighter once <unk> <unk> pride even more than his blade
surveying the monster <unk> <unk> the duo are in league with doctor <unk> which ties into the story he just told
at one time the small wound <unk> dealt wasn't healing for some reason and the doctor treating him was doctor <unk>
he explains that some <unk> energy infected the wound when it was dealt and <unk> would have to be the donor to <unk>
<unk> immediately questions why he was immediately rejected as a donor but got no answer
rather he learned that <unk> was conducting an experiment on a soldier type g in which monsters were to be made but one failed experiment actually produced genesis as a result
however such an existence has proved to have side effects such as his body rapidly degrading and the curious ability to make copies of himself
<unk> himself appears he's surprised to see them but explains only he can stop <unk> degradation after which genesis himself appears and explains <unk> won't be captured
genesis <unk> their situation to his favorite play <unk> and wonders which of the three friends would be the hero to which he still <unk> <unk>
meanwhile <unk> <unk> <unk> but <unk> himself <unk> and shows him he too has become a monster with his own set of wings
<unk> refuses to fight against <unk> who is frustrated as his reality of being a monster is <unk> with his principles and dreams and <unk> is sent tumbling down
when he comes to <unk> is in a church in the slums where he was woken up by <unk> a young woman living there he's immediately smitten with <unk> asking her out on a date but getting quickly turned down
he is impressed by the rare sight of flowers in <unk> suggesting she sell them and not only <unk> up <unk> with flowers but also make a lot of money on the side
she still ends up spending the day with <unk> as at her favorite shop <unk> insists on getting her her choice of a gift resulting in <unk> picking out a large pink hair ribbon
she loves the gift promising to wear it always though as their not officially a date date continues she questions the normalcy of members of soldiers as rumor goes they receive some sort of special surgery that turns them beyond human
she admits their lust for battle also makes them a bit frightening and <unk> chooses this time to confess he's is a soldier
she is naturally surprised and actually likes his unique eyes to which <unk> continues to flirt showing off the trademark <unk> infused eyes of a soldier
<unk> gets called back to <unk> but succeeded in leaving a good impression on <unk> and they agree to see each other again in route back to <unk> <unk> stops <unk> again this time more willing to talk
he asks for <unk> help as he's slowly losing his mind and not only wants to keep his honor but also wants <unk> to help him defeat their enemies that are causing so much suffering
<unk> agrees but he's swept away before he can ask further questions he's delivered to <unk> who's also helping <unk> as they fight genesis whom they suspect is being used by <unk> to kill another notorious scientist within <unk> <unk>
meanwhile <unk> sees through the power play when genesis arrives though <unk> and <unk> are soon to arrive as well genesis retreats but not before summoning <unk> fury for <unk> to deal with
later <unk> goes to visit <unk> when <unk> <unk> him to call him into a mission to <unk> and gives <unk> pause when he says he also knows <unk> but won't elaborate
genesis forces shoot down their helicopter though <unk> <unk> and a couple of common <unk> <unk> manage to survive
they joke that <unk> is a country boy from the sticks so this harsh terrain won't bother him though it turns out one of the <unk> is as well
<unk> is from the tiny village of <unk> and this village is from <unk> who introduces himself as cloud
as the mission for <unk> continues genesis moves to kill him as he's already begun visibly degrading and claims he doesn't need <unk> anymore
<unk> saves <unk> who beats away cloud while trying to restrain him and <unk> <unk> once more genesis proving he's a match against the degrading ace who is severely weakened and promises to end the world with his own miserable fate
on his way out he is met by <unk> as well as <unk> who explain the g in project g was not for genesis but for gillian who was <unk> mother who apparently took her own life earlier in <unk>
the experiment was two fold gillian had <unk> cells injected into her while she was pregnant with <unk> and genesis simply had <unk> cells implanted directly into him as a test tube baby
what this resulted in was the failure genesis growing up strong but doom to a short lifespan while <unk> was perceived and born as a perfect specimen
reason being <unk> can use the <unk> cells as a two way <unk> as intended <unk> then explains his cells can absorb genetic traits and pass them to others beyond what genesis can manage which is only imprint them onto others
choosing to end his suffering by his own hands <unk> casts away <unk> and absorbs a variety of monsters he created to help test and strengthen <unk>
the resulting abomination <unk> <unk> cleanly on the cheek and he is forced to kill the resulting mess that used to be his friend and mentor
after winning a bitter victory a degrading <unk> is grateful that <unk> ended him with dignity and honor before dying he passes on his family sword and legacy of honor the buster sword to <unk>
even after returning to <unk> <unk> openly <unk> to <unk> with whom he's developed a much closer relationship and has chosen to retain the scar <unk> gave him as a <unk>
time passes as <unk> and his hair style has matured
he is no longer the young puppy he used to be as now a mentor himself to a new class of soldier <unk>
<unk> sends him for some r and r at costa del sol with <unk> watching over him as it turns out director <unk> has since gone missing and was secretly using company money to fuel <unk> research
she <unk> him about his girlfriend <unk> and explains she's under constant turk surveillance as it turns out she is the last living member of a race called the ancient
<unk> is surprised not only to learn this but also that <unk> never told him
unexpectedly genesis copies attack them a sea which can only mean genesis is still around too
<unk> isn't so sure and <unk> that since all souls return to the life stream its possible <unk> soul is still able to control his copies from there as well
and so <unk> vacation is over as the three of them are to investigate attack on <unk>
it turns out more genesis <unk> were attacking and this time <unk> was even there though he gets away once again
<unk> comes by to greet <unk> and questions if genesis really did die he deliberately drops that even the slums in <unk> are being attacked encourages <unk> to return there and promises they'll meet again
returning to <unk> he finds a monster dog there but its not really causing problems though <unk> notes its also an <unk> copy and it seems keen to protect <unk>
however its weak due to degradation and chooses to rest in the <unk> meanwhile <unk> builds <unk> a cart to sell flowers from and has her give him a list of her wishes so he can do his best to make her happy
unfortunately an urgent mission comes up to separate their time together
now <unk> and <unk> have been dispatched to come in after a monster outbreak near a rural <unk> reactor that has even killed the soldier operatives there
interestingly these operatives were tracking the missing <unk> and reported a strange pod device similar to <unk> which means <unk> <unk> and genesis might all be involved here
as their mission in mentions nothing of their old friends <unk> privately confesses to <unk> that he's seriously considering leaving <unk> as well depending on what happens in this mission
before departing <unk> spends some precious time with <unk> though <unk> is never far off
<unk> promises to protect <unk> as he's always done and <unk> sincerely thanks him as the only person he can rely on these days
before the mission cloud turns out to be one of the three dispatched to him and turns out the reactor they must investigate is in <unk> hometown of <unk>
as they arrive <unk> makes small talk asking cloud how it feels to be home again and trying to relate as he has no original town and all he knows is his mother's name to be <unk> who died after he was born
in town they are met by a local town girl by the name of <unk>
when <unk> learns he's a soldier first class she seems surprised by the fact they only sent him and <unk> and begins to ask something else but stops and runs off instead
as <unk> moves on to investigate he tells cloud he can visit his family while he's in town and when <unk> wonders why cloud is hesitating and wearing his helmet and mask he admits its something <unk> personal
he later admits he was exaggerating and telling his friends back home that he was already a soldier first class and is too ashamed to confront that lie now
meanwhile <unk> finds this whole area oddly familiar and after they learn <unk> is to be their guide to the reactor they pause to have a group photo taken
as <unk> <unk> <unk> and a hiding cloud arrive at the reactor cloud is told to wait outside with <unk> and keep her safe
within <unk> finds it interesting that the chamber to the reactor is also named the same as <unk> mother as the war hero <unk> identifies the cause of the reactor <unk>
<unk> appears into one of the pods powering the plant and is shocked to find a monster within
<unk> explains that while the average soldier is a <unk> infused human they are still simply stronger than normal humans
however this thing has <unk> levels exponentially higher than even a soldier <unk> doesn't know what they are beyond that they're <unk> created by doctor <unk> in his lab
<unk> notes <unk> is well above average himself and asks if there is something more to that and it triggers a splitting headache for <unk>
<unk> comes to a horrifying hypothesis that its possible he was created the same way and it becomes a crisis of identity ironically identical to his friends genesis and <unk>
he admits he always knew he was unlike other children growing up but could never place why and doesn't want to think the reason could be that he's been the same as a monster
he questions his humanity when suddenly a sneak attack by genesis knocks <unk> back
genesis <unk> in to inform <unk> that of the three friends he was the greatest monster to come out of the <unk> project possibly due to having <unk> instead of <unk> managing him
<unk> is more focused on the confirmed existence of genesis but he's ignored as genesis continues to push <unk> with his past
he explains the <unk> projects were all projects involving usage of <unk> cells <unk> herself was <unk> from <unk> year old rock layer and is a true monster herself
<unk> is shocked again yet genesis continues exposing that <unk> project g created successes like <unk> and failures like himself
and <unk> project s use the remains of every experiment thus far to create a perfect monster <unk> himself
in addition <unk> cannot copy or diffuse his genes so he cannot degrade
he makes another plea for <unk> to share cells with him and <unk> replies that regardless of anything he just said being true or not he'll do the right thing and let the evil genesis rot
however <unk> moves after genesis but <unk> to save <unk> and a beaten cloud from a monster
afterwards cloud wishes he were strong like <unk> but <unk> warns him not to get tangled up with soldier
the next morning <unk> informs <unk> that <unk> is in the <unk> mansion and <unk> gets a phone call from <unk> ending it with a promise to see her after the mission
meanwhile <unk> has found an old archive underneath the mansion and within reads many reports on the <unk> project learning information such as <unk> was also an ancient like <unk>
after waiting seven days while <unk> reads nonstop <unk> comes out to discover <unk>
an suddenly on fire with many <unk> slain even cloud is being once again and around the corner is <unk> himself calmly standing amidst the flames
following him back to the reactor <unk> sees an injured <unk> within <unk> cursing both <unk> and soldier
breaking through the door to <unk> <unk> sees <unk> beyond unusually unsettled and talking strangely about going to the promised land together with his mother
confronting <unk> <unk> is ignored as <unk> insists his mother the ancient was the superior race and they should have ruled the planet
somehow humans stole that opportunity for sovereignty and hunted the ancients to near extinction instead
finally fed up with the crimes of humans and <unk> in particular <unk> sees what <unk> and genesis kept warning about and chooses to stand alone
embracing the fact that he was never human and thus doesn't have to pretend to be anymore disgusted with <unk> sick and twisted past of violating his mother
and accepting of being of the master race of ancients <unk> <unk> all ties to <unk> soldier and the human race
he tears away a mechanical facade to reveal the real <unk> who has been savagely mutilated and experimented on by <unk> and left to be a monstrous battery within this power plant
<unk> still wants answers for the dead towns folk and questions <unk> sanity but <unk> has no more words for any human even they used to be his allies
feeling betrayed <unk> attacks <unk> who <unk> him easily and knocks him to the depths of the reactor
as they clash <unk> remembers when <unk> was still the ideal hero and role model to him
once explaining that <unk> which allows humans to use magic is form from condensed <unk> energy from the planet and contains knowledge of the ancients who were bound to the planet and have the power to control it at will
accusing <unk> of losing his way he is countered by <unk> who considers himself to be the chosen one despite being engineered by humans to be a <unk> ancient to do their bidding
he intends to carry on what he feels is the right of the ancients and rule this world and take it back the power hungry humans like the <unk> corporation
again they clash with <unk> clearly controlling the duel forced back the buster sword is knocked from <unk> hand as <unk> no longer has the energy to fight back
after the exhaustive fight <unk> is fixated on liberating his mother and doesn't notice cloud coming up behind him with <unk> sword and striking him with a sneak attack
cloud then rushes to <unk> side but <unk> comes out bearing the head of <unk> and upset at <unk> insulting strike
<unk> urges cloud to finish off an injured <unk> but naturally cloud is nowhere near <unk> league in terms of strength
however cloud makes up for it in sheer guts as after <unk> <unk> him on his sword and issues a warning not to make him mad cloud instead uses all his strength to lift up <unk> who's surprised by the feat and hurl him away
cloud <unk> to his injuries next to <unk> and as they both pass out doctor <unk> arrives on the scene and chooses cloud to be his next test subject
the next thing he knows a vision of the <unk> wakes <unk> up as he breaks out of his tank fighting <unk> he gets cloud out but cloud is stuck in a <unk> state
after changing cloud into his spare soldier first class uniform <unk> recalls <unk> last letter for him in which she wants to spend more time together which prompts him to make his next destination back to <unk>
however <unk> labels them both fugitive samples so they find themselves now running from the army and <unk> actually manages to catch up to them first
he pleads with her to just walk away as he knows its a tall order to escape the turks but <unk> chooses her duty over her personal feelings
however <unk> refuses to fight her seriously for now and must leave her behind
still she follows them and <unk> with <unk> severe case of <unk> addiction and so helps them this once to escape with her motorcycle
however genesis isn't done as he <unk> their ride seizing <unk> and pulling out a bit of his hair
he knows they are <unk> latest experiments and modified versions of <unk> power runs through both of them
he asks one of his <unk> eat his hair sample in order to gain the cells needed to cease his degradation but all it does is mutate the clone into a gruesome monster
later <unk> crosses by his hometown of <unk> but <unk> is there and warns him the turks already expected him to visit his parents though they are also hunting for <unk> in the area who reportedly was sighted in <unk> lab
she's watching over his family for him and <unk> that his parents have already asked her to join the family
<unk> notes something like <unk> was also nearby but flies away again and later he is surprised to find doctor <unk> and genesis himself
it turns out that after the doctor nearly died by the hand of genesis he used his cells to stay alive and despite degrading on borrowed time is looking for a cure for that now
genesis believes a pure s cell sample will stop their degradation and only cloud and <unk> bear those right now
<unk> makes a grab for cloud but <unk> puts and end to the doctor once and for all with a little help from former director <unk>
he's white winged and degrading like <unk> with his exact face precisely because he's been turned into an <unk> copy by his own doing
while the real <unk> really is dead <unk> finds himself with <unk> will to save <unk> and others which means they must stop genesis once and for all
almost to <unk> <unk> stops to finally confront the failed and tortured creation of a <unk> infused human who considers <unk> a perfect fusion of <unk> will and <unk> superior cells
behind him is a statue to the goddess <unk> as well as a massive <unk> he claims will return everyone to the life stream
<unk> attempts to calm genesis down and try to help him regain his humanity but genesis chooses to uses the <unk> power to transform into a massive armored monster
<unk> wins over this form <unk> genesis to his original form once more who is now cured of his degradation thanks to the <unk>
<unk> sees no reason to fight now but genesis still insists and <unk> is frustrated that once again he has to shoulder a burden forced upon him
<unk> one final time he knocks genesis back who for an instant turns around and sees the goddess <unk> as he always imagined just before falling for good in the life stream <unk> his final defeat
still honorable <unk> carries a still breathing genesis and lays him to rest beside cloud and an injured <unk>
<unk> says the winged <unk> copy from before protected cloud from <unk> earlier but its too late as the final copies of <unk> die and return to the life stream leaving <unk> as his only living legacy
the winged dog also had a letter for <unk> in its possession which <unk> reads
it turns out its from <unk> and its apparently been four years since their last meeting and this has been <unk> <unk> letter she sent him
she mentions her flower sales are doing well these days and despite her feelings for him this would be her final letter to him
naturally <unk> is upset to learn he's been unconscious for four years but still wants to be with <unk> and make things right despite his unintended absence
carrying cloud he has every intention to get back to <unk> save cloud and <unk> with <unk>
after leaving genesis to rest genesis is soon snatched away by two mysterious soldiers first class nero and weiss who seek to recruit genesis into their organization of deep ground preceding events to be played out in a future game <unk> of <unk>
meanwhile <unk> orders <unk> and the other turks to find and save <unk> before the army finds them which <unk> is very motivated to do
though this is a <unk> action <unk> is willing to risk it for his friend and for <unk> sake
at the same time <unk> and cloud are in the back of a pickup truck just outside <unk> and even the turks are having a hard time finding them now
unfortunately the army <unk> <unk> first and <unk> willingly chooses to fight and <unk> protect cloud despite his own desire to return to <unk> and save himself
cloud only now begins to wake up out of his <unk> poisoning as <unk> walks out to face down literally hundreds upon hundreds of <unk> troops and attack helicopters
commenting that the price of freedom is steep <unk> gives a final salute and promise to protect his honor as he takes on <unk> military single <unk>
as he stands strong against thousands of blades bullets and missiles <unk> is pushed to his limit as he recalls the bonds he held precious in life
starting with his close friends within <unk> he fondly recalls his former heroic idol <unk> and turks <unk> and <unk>
then finally his closest bonds those of his friend and mentor <unk> inspiring <unk> cloud and his love interest <unk>
against all odds <unk> triumphs in his final stand but he is on his last legs as <unk> begins reinforcing their troops firing countless bullets into a relentless <unk>
eventually enough is enough as he cannot overcome his wounds anymore and after some nameless infantry man puts a final bullet into his head
<unk> the rising star of soldier first class with dreams of heroism despite being dragged into so many outside messes tragically falls with thoughts of <unk> to carry him into his final moments
as the game concludes <unk> notes the sudden rain and seems to sense something wrong
meanwhile cloud finally wakes up and <unk> himself over to <unk> who is still barely alive and forces a smile for him and urges cloud to live on in his stead as his own living legacy
passing the buster sword onto cloud he also passes on his dream of being a hero for cloud to fulfill
cloud acknowledges the passing of the torch and <unk> <unk> dies though with a smile on his face
cloud thanks him promises not to forget and he walks away leaving <unk> body behind
joining the life stream <unk> is greeted by his friend <unk> who finally now is able to rest in peace
as the game ends the trauma of the events unfortunately result in cloud blocking all memory of <unk> despite his promise
his delirium actually has him believing he is <unk> in all but name as the game leads up to the original installment final fantasy seven
crisis core final fantasy seven has enjoyed the success of selling over six and a half million copies worldwide
hi everyone welcome back to <unk> and happy valentine's day sending you lots of love today i wanna share some self love journaling prompts that you can do today to just cultivate more self love for yourself
so i'll just get right into it the first is an easy one that's actually in my artist of life workbook is to list ten things that you love about yourself
so this one's pretty simple i i know it can be hard for some people who have never really thought of themselves like that so if it's hard for you to find things that you love about yourself why don't you start with things that you like like what personality traits that you like about yourself
or you could ask some friends what they think your best qualities are and then start from there the next journaling prompt is to take some time to sit down and write a love letter to yourself now i know i've shared that one before because i love it so much
but the fun hook is you can do it on this website called <unk> where you send that love letter to yourself for next year's valentine's day you know what i mean
so as you're writing this love letter and celebrating everything that you are you're going to feel amazing as you're writing it you're gonna feel the love start cultivating for yourself
but at the same time the fun part is that because you're sending it back to yourself a year later for next year's valentine's day
then you're gonna get a little surprise in a year and maybe you can do this every year so that you send yourself a love letter every year for valentine's day because <unk> self love is super important and you can never have too much of it
alright the next journaling prompt is something that i learned from my friend <unk> <unk> this past sunday actually we did a live chat together on facebook if you want to watch that full live chat it's really amazing
i'll link it down below so that you can watch the chat also follow my facebook page because i'm gonna do more live chats and just post more videos on facebook anyway this prompt is to list all the things that you don't exactly like about yourself
list all those traits that you find yourself either worrying about or complaining about or just anything that doesn't sit well with yourself list those traits and then add but i love myself anyway at the end
so for example i feel lazy and <unk> today but i love myself anyway or i don't always feel pretty or confident when i'm in a social setting but i love myself anyway
or i think that i talk too much but i love myself anyway do you see what we're doing here so you're taking a trait that is kind of seen as negative in your head those traits that you're usually like <unk> why am i like this
or i don't like this part about me basically the traits where you're being judgmental on yourself or hard on yourself because that's what we do all the time and then just listing it out being honest about it
and then end it with but i love myself anyway so this is a great way to learn to love all that you are the good parts and the bad parts or the strengths and the weaknesses because love is unconditional
love encompasses all so i know we started out with like the things that you do love about yourself and this is another way to kind of be honest about the things that you don't necessarily like about yourself and yet you love yourself anyway
because nobody is perfect if you think about the people that you love in your life they're not perfect they have flaws they have times that they make mistakes and yet you love them anyway
so learn to treat yourself in that way like yes i might not like this characteristic about myself or i might feel this way that doesn't support me but i love myself anyway
so it's just learning to be unconditional with your love it's so great right so like i said if you want to watch that full video with <unk> i'll link that video down below so you could catch up
next i'm gonna share some journaling prompts that you can actually ask yourself every day in the morning just to get yourself off on the right foot because every day you want to be listening to yourself and doing what serves you best
so at the beginning of every day you can always ask yourself questions like what am i excited to do today or how can i give myself that extra care today because i'm all about self care guys and lastly what can i do to protect my energy
and i love that last question i actually have that question in my workbook too because it's like being aware of how you can protect your energy in a way that you're not allowing you know toxic people in your life
or you're not just saying yes to people just because you're a <unk> you know a lot of times for me personally it's hard to say no but in order to protect my energy and my well-being i have to learn to say no more more often
so that i don't find myself in those awkward situations where i'm doing something that i don't want to be doing but i said yes so i have to do it and it just doesn't feel good you don't want to put yourself in those situations
but yeah i think that's a pretty good start on journaling prompts that you can do today to cultivate more self love in your life also as you're checking out that live chat video on my facebook just go ahead and like my facebook page while you're at it
because i'm gonna be doing more live chats here and there and i'm just trying to post more videos on facebook and be more active there
alright i hope you have a beautiful valentine's day i will see you guys in the next one bye
bob and <unk> <unk> risked everything to help others
they <unk> their home and pledge their life savings to rescue orphans
bring medicine
and deliver hope
the determination and compassion of our founders drives <unk> today
the bob and <unk> <unk> humanitarian spirit award celebrates extraordinary commitment and courage to help others
throughout his career doctor <unk> gupta has been a champion for the most vulnerable and raised awareness about the world's most pressing health issues
doctor gupta has set a high bar as a caring leader and has dedicated his life to helping others
can't you just feel that conflict is becoming apparent in our culture
it reminds me of those words of john paul second were now living in the final confrontation between the gospel and the <unk> between the church and the <unk> between christ and the <unk>
and if we don't choose to know god's word to believe god's word to follow god's word we are gonna be a sitting duck for all kinds of confusion all kinds of disorder those are really important choices people have to make
and these choices are difficult who am i gonna marry what kind of life am i gonna live how am i gonna raise my kids what am i gonna do with my time my talent and my treasure
and i have to make a choice today jesus says to each one of us i came that you might have life and have it to the full the question is do we want it
hey welcome to another week of the choices we face we have a a special thing for you today we are celebrating so many years that the lord has blessed us renewal ministries we put together a special video telling us about the renewal ministries story
yeah it's good it's really good
let's watch it
yeah
what we're primarily trying to communicate to the world is jesus the holy name of jesus the only name given by which human beings can be saved god the father
the the the clouds are opening again he's saying to the world this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased listen to him all we're trying to say is listen to him
look at him look at the gift that god the father is giving us look at the the price that jesus christ paid for us on the cross look at how much he loves us listen to him pay attention to him join your life with him
<unk> two there were many <unk> and changes that went on both in the church and outside the church and against the church and for the church and it it was a whirlwind
and i began to realize that my faith wasn't nearly as strong as i thought it was here i was a religious sister here i was vowed to him and my faith was very very shaken
and it was shaken because there were just so many theories being thrown at us or things that we had believed or seemed to be in concrete were suddenly up for question and i realized that i wasn't rooted deeply enough
and i had had a good education i had had religious formation but something hadn't transmitted from here to here
yeah well like so many people i got caught up in the confusion of our culture moral confusion intellectual confusion and then a friend invited me to make a retreat when i was a senior at the university of notre dame
i was very skeptical about it i felt like i was a philosophy major and i felt like gee i kind of know about these things and and then i just heard the most amazing story about the catholic faith and how beautiful it was but that wouldn't have been enough
i really experienced the personal presence of christ on that retreat and i felt like he was addressing me i didn't hear any words but i just knew he was there and i just knew that i had to make a decision about him yeah was he who he said he was or not
when i was twenty years old nineteen <unk> my sister convinced me to go to a conference at the university of notre dame and i always wanted to see notre dame touchdown jesus so i thought i'll go
thirty-five thousand catholics about two hundred priests and bishops it was a catholic charismatic renewal event
and the when i got there i realized i was in a very different place than what it looked like every other person in the stadium and everybody seemed to just be so alive and animated in their faith
i was a pretty nominal catholic at that point i had seen god do some amazing things in my family but essentially that weekend i began to search and hunger
if he really was the son of god if he really was alive if he really was present i i knew that my search had just come to an end unexpectedly soon and i thought i'd be searching for years and years and years but there he was
and by the grace and mercy of god i was able to swallow my pride and repent and go to confession and really surrender my life to the lord i have to tell you i'm just profoundly grateful for god's mercy to me and helping me find him when i did
i don't know where i'd be today without him
and so i um was inspired to call a good friend of mine who was a <unk> sister and i talked to her and after we talked for fifteen or twenty minutes she said to me
what are you looking for
and i said i don't know
but i wanna give my life to god in a way i never have before and i don't know what that means i've given him my whole life he has my my vows and vowed to him what what more can i give him
and her response was very wise we were the same age but her response was very wise she said to me then just tell him that
so i went home and walked into the chapel and said lord i wanna give my life to you in a way i never have before i don't know what that means but you have it whatever that is
i walked out of the chapel and
nothing no no bells and whistles as they say today no nothing like that i just walked out of the chapel and started up the stairs i was gonna correct papers
and um as i was walking up the stairs as i often say if i could go into that convent today i could tell you the exact step where i was
when it was like somebody took a pitcher of water
and poured it over my head
and
and that's the that was the only way i could describe the experience
but i was not afraid
and i was cynical i was still pretty cynical and i so i took a few more steps up and i said god is this you
what is this
and he said it is my holy spirit
how did i hear no audible voice just a thought goes through your head that you know is not your own
he said this is my holy spirit and the joy that came into my life in that moment has never gone
well you know when i when i first turned my life over to the lord when i was a senior at notre dame i i didn't have any plans to go into ministry
i just knew i had met god and that was the most important thing in my life so i went off to grad school to princeton and then i took a leave from grad school to begin working for the <unk> movement
and then i ah got involved in the charismatic renewal movement and then cardinal <unk> asked me to move to belgium so it isn't like i had a plan
i'm trying not to put any limits on the lord i'm trying not to have any <unk> i'm trying to each day get up and do what seems to be the most pleasing thing to him
so then the last the closing of the event was a big liturgy in the football stadium and i was begging the lord in my heart
please help me give me the faith give me the love give me something because i don't have the strength to resist sin essentially and to really live for you wholeheartedly
and i went to communion came back from communion i was standing in my place and they ah this guy comes up to me and he's got his name tag on he is from indianapolis a guy maybe in his mid <unk> at the time i was twenty
and he said to me he said son he looked at my <unk> and he said peter do you mind if i share something with you and i said sure he said i'm back here about six rows and i was going to communion and i saw you and my eyes fell on you
and i felt the holy spirit touch my heart and say you go tell that young man that the faith and love that he is seeking shall be granted to him because christ loves him and has died for him
as soon as he said that it was like a bomb went off
the grace of god touch me in a new way and i put my arms around the guy and we stood there and i just squeezed him and i cried like a baby on his shoulder i felt
i felt in my spirit and i think that's the day i experienced the calling for what i'm doing right now and as this guy is holding me i'm just experiencing a tremendous sense of the love of god pouring into me
and the lordship and the majesty of jesus christ that he is the lord all power and authority belongs to him and he said my son i'm calling you trust me
and then he said i looked around to see my people were getting touched everywhere like that and i felt in my heart like the holy spirit was saying welcome the reign of god is at hand you're part of the kingdom the kingdom is alive because the king is alive and i went home my whole life changed after that
well i began with renewal ministries back in actually i i knew ralph for quite a number of years and we spoke at some conferences together and certainly had somewhat of a common mind
and then peter came into the picture as well and the three of us just at different times collaborating at at a conference somewhere we began to see that we all had a kind of similar message
i saw ralph martin on that conference for the first time ever he was a speaker in nineteen <unk>
there was a lot of speakers but when he spoke ah that saturday afternoon he spoke like like the prophet elijah for some reason it went right through me like a sword and and brought tremendous conviction to me
that's partly what i was praying for was that kind of conviction and that carried through for me as i left that place i bought every tape every every book i could find of his and i read it and i got other guys to do it with me
and we would literally we would spend friday nights some friday nights doing in college believe it or not and we would listen to these talks and it would really burn in us and we get on our knees we get on our face in the carpet and we say lord jesus what you put in him put in us
and it did that
well we all had a really strong encounter with the lord in different ways through the catholic charismatic renewal and we all ended up here in ann arbor michigan as part of a a covenant community and we we knew each other there
but then at a certain point in nineteen <unk> things were kind of happening and changing around us
so we found ourselves drawn together and we felt like the lord was calling us to meet every week for an extended period of prayer and just really asking the lord what he wanted for us and from that came a much closer collaboration
how it all began i don't know if ralph mentioned this but kind of how it all began was he and i went to ah hear a talk in detroit at a large conference we came to hear one speaker at this larger conference
and we heard this speaker he was good we were getting ready to leave the guy who was <unk> the event ah was making announcements just before lunch he made all his announcements and he said but
before we go i just wanted to mention our leadership team up here and our prophecy team feel called to pray for two men who are here today there was about fifteen hundred people in the crowd and they pointed us out and we weren't even members of the conference so we didn't even think they were talking to us
eventually they said it's you two would you be willing to have our team pray with you we looked at each other and said all right why not and so everybody got excused for lunch we went up there with the team and a mature group of people
and they started praying for us with ralph and i'm just kind of watching and and it was one of the first times where i saw ah the gift of prophecy kind of a word of knowledge working in a in a very powerful way
and they started saying things about ralph and about his life which they couldn't have known that were indications of how god had worked in him and the and what the lord wanted to do with him
then so i'm thinking whoa this is probably get a little too close i don't think i wanna listen i think i wanna go before it's my turn kind of thing and so anyway they prayed over me and they said ah one person said the lord is gonna start sewing you into lands all around the world
and he's gonna bring to you men and women who he has already he has already called and he has already ah empowered to be able to stand alongside you and the one person said yeah i see these these images of <unk> all lined up
and they are all equipped and they are all ready to go and the lord wants you to launch them and those <unk> are people and bishops and priests and <unk> that god has called to go to the world to engage the new <unk> and he wants you guys to help launch them
and so after it was all done we were driving home and saying wow what do you think of that you know and the ralph said just said you know scripture is very clear it says to never despise prophecy but test everything and cling to what is good
so we began to pray once a week together to say lord if this is you we are ready to receive it if it's not you we weren't working together at that time we were just we were in the same community the same parish but were renewal ministries hadn't yet happened with us together
and so we decided to pray and then we invited sister ann and a few others once a week to pray with us we would pray each week and try to listen and week after week we would say anybody hearing anything you know ah from the lord no where we're supposed to go no
and then at one point a couple of months into it sister ann shields said at the end of the prayer time she goes this sounds kind of strange you guys but i think we're supposed to go to <unk> and ukraine
so here we are in the basement of a house here in ann arbor sister ann gets a sense we are supposed to go to <unk> we don't know anybody there two weeks later the bishop of the cultural center of the country calls us and said would you come and help me
and what we had heard <unk> from folks who prayed for us said only go through doors that god is gonna open he will open the doors for you it started in <unk> and then it went to <unk> and then it went to hungary and then it went to ukraine and now it's forty countries around the world
and that's kind of how it all happened and we start once we started we said okay clearly god is calling us what are we gonna do so we formed an organization renewal ministries that's how it happened
this thought came into my head i want you on catholic radio
and catholic radio
didn't exist except for some work at e w t n but that was it
and it was just i want you on catholic radio and i i thought
so i went to ralph and i cause this is what you do when you get some thought you know is it indigestion or is it a world from the lord and i said look what ralph i don't even know if catholic radio exists
and he said well let's let's just pray
and six months later i got this call from e w t n asking me if i would be willing to do a radio program on on their station and i said yes
and they said don't don't you need to talk to anybody about this or don't you need to pray about this and i said
um no i think the lord prepared me and ralph had said just pray if it if something happens then we will know this is from the lord
my religious community had prayed about it knew about it so when the invitation came it was like all the groundwork had been raised so it had been laid so from then on i found that's one of the main things i've been doing
speaking writing parish missions all of that and then particularly focused on the radio
we got into radio which we hadn't planned at the beginning sister <unk> program food for the journey which is all over the place in the country it is a very dynamic radio show
and then a few years after that i felt i was in a meeting with ralph just catching up seeing how things are going he said what's the lord saying to you these days and i said you know crazy i think i'm supposed to do radio
ah we didn't have any money for it
let's just see what the lord does if you are willing so we prayed and about a week later i got a call from mike jones from <unk> maria radio out of the blue and he said have you ever thought about doing radio
i said yeah in fact i have and he said would you go into do a show with us i said i don't have any money he said well we'll do it we'll produce it just come and do the show so step by step things like that began to happen
crossing the goal emerged ah another television show in e w t n that we collaborate together with a team danny <unk> curtis martin and a variety of folks a show that was geared toward men
and again it was something that was in my heart for years before i felt like the lord said
you've got to start working to reach men and give them challenge them to dare to believe and to go for it i tried a few things and nothing really took off
and but it was still in my heart and out of the blue danny and i met each other <unk> ah ministries were so our desires and ministry so common we ended up combining together creating this other show so that has emerged
another important piece of what we're doing is and have done from the beginning is is find a way to be able to engage more <unk> directly in ministry and <unk>
so ah raised up more and more people to work with us internationally on mission teams going all over the world our country <unk> we call them
and then ah the last few years with a with a heart for millennials we just felt like the lord said there's ah in the ann arbor area here there are lots of young people who have a serious call in their life from the lord and they have really grown a lot
and they used had a lot of support and formation in their life and we felt like the lord said help release them into what i've called them to do make a way for them make a path so that's partly what we've done too that's where i d nine sixteen the young adult ministry emerged from
a lot of really things the lord has called all of us to peter and sister ann and myself is to express in writing some of the things that we feel are the most important truths that people need to hear right now in our culture
and so like for example ah one of the highlights for me was really finishing a book that i worked on for ten years it's called the fulfillment of all desire a <unk> for the journey to god based on the wisdom of the saints
i just really felt like there's such a treasure of wisdom in our church in these great doctrines of the church but why god like used to happen to me years ago the first time i picked up a book by john of the cross it was like what
what's he talking about and what he was talking about was so scary i decided to put the book down and then twenty-five years later just like it all kind of came alive for me and so i really felt like there is tremendous stuff here
if you could just communicate it in a clear orderly understandable way people would get so much help in in growing in their union with the lord
peter has written books like that and sister ann has written books like that and so part of part of the ministry is also the writing which which has helped an awful lot of people
ah john paul was a kind of shepherd and guide for us he was the guy who interpreted for us what the spirit is saying to the church and it and it <unk> with what our sense was so he confirmed us in the mission
we had gone to rome we were going a conference in rome and the last night that we were there ah we got a phone call from the holy father john paul asking if we would like to come to his mass the next morning
and you know it was like like to you know of course so we ah we went there and after mass when he came to ralph who was next to me
i gave him a copy of my latest book at the time called the catholic church at the end of the age what is the spirit saying he took the book and he said you know i read it already i almost fell over i almost became speechless
then he turned to ralph and he took ralph by the upper arms he just took him and he kind of shook him like this and he said ralph tell me what is the spirit saying to the church
and i knew he didn't want the whole three hundred page answer so i said holy father i think what the spirit is saying to the church is jesus so he took my hand and he said jesus and i said jesus
we just stood there for a couple of minutes saying the name of jesus and it was just a very very special moment of communion with the lord and communion with the pope and just proclaiming the name of jesus together it was just very very special
john paul second is our patron and one of our one of our central the central patron maybe of ah renewal ministries and so he is a great <unk> for us we continue to pray we ask for his help i feel his presence especially when i am on mission internationally
in a very special way we have asked saint john paul second to be our patron we also ask mary
you know she is the queen of the new <unk> she's she's appearing in the world she's carrying forth the message she's sort of like leading the charge in many ways
and and we pray we try to stay close we try to listen you know to what's happening through the <unk> that are accepted by the church and what is the message there as well because it is prophetic
it's a prophetic message and we feel like we are a prophetic ministry in part you know that we are meant to what is that mean we are meant to really dial in to try to hear what the spirit is saying to the church today and to be able to communicate that to other people
what does god want
from us who are his sons and daughters how are we called to live in this generation in this time and all of the challenges that we are certainly beginning to face
because right now ah seventeen hundred years of christian culture is collapsing all kinds of supports that used to be there for living a moral life or all kinds of respect that used to be there for the church for the synagogue whatever just isn't there anymore
and more and more we're living in the growth of an international pagan culture that is becoming increasingly hostile to christ and the church where is their loyalty
what do they really think about jesus christ are they willing to suffer for him are they willing to suffer rather than to deny him are they willing to do everything they can to pass on the faith to their children
even when the culture is placing tremendous obstacles in front of it so we are living in quite a time of conflict and decision it's for such a time as this that we have been called to do what we're doing
and i hope that renewal ministries can help people make the decision that they are gonna be friends of jesus christ and they are gonna be loyal to him even in the midst of tremendous oppression and and difficulties
the culture is lethal
right now it's it's not just kind of you know enticing you
it's it's just taking people and taking them right out of the framework in which they have lived with the little faith that perhaps they have had
even if their faith is strong the <unk> of the world are now so strong that if people aren't really rooted in god they can they can easily be pulled out without even realizing at first what's happening to them
so it's in all these ways that i think renewal ministries brings a message it brings the love of god it helps people right where they are you don't have to be ashamed of where you are
ah just come come and learn the love that god has for you come and learn the mercy that he has for you and then see as you become a disciple of christ see how he wants to use you in a world that is pretty broken
you know peter when you're right in the middle of it every day and you're getting up every day and doing what you're supposed to do sometimes you don't get the whole trajectory of what god's done and it is just amazing see what the lord has done with with us
yeah it's been it's been an amazing journey
a number of things came to mind thinking about it it's not like we had a grand plan at the beginning
no
it was the lord was getting our attention and he said look i want you to do something and it was step by step we had help from other people just encouragement in the spirit
you know i was just thinking how ah pope john paul second used to say saint john paul second and now pope francis so you know that the part of the spirit's ah mission is to reveal jesus to every human heart but to create movement
and as we together were encountering the spirit more deeply he moved us and he and he moved other people and and it was like we were carried along
yeah
so it's just really great
yeah
yeah
no it's really encouraging it really is true the holy spirit leads people he led us he can lead anybody it's just really amazing and just the way you told the story about how we got launched into you know <unk> and you know all the other countries we are in
and and to this day i mean like very week we are getting reports from our country <unk> who are doing tremendous things in so many countries around the world
right and continues to do it this past year we did you know last year we did <unk> international missions in about thirty-five different countries in eastern europe africa asia the middle east and collaborating with just some amazing people you know ah cardinal turks you just put you know
clergy religious <unk> from all over the world in a partnership i mean we don't as i mentioned we don't you know go hang up our shingle around the world and get people to join our organization
the lord just has given us gifts and experience and resources to come alongside these brothers and sisters around the world and partner with them in a communion and mission that is is our contribution to this great moment of <unk> and new <unk> in the church
yeah and we we always thought that the lord had given us something that could really help strengthen leadership in the church the lord has given us so many opportunities now to do that
you know i just i just got back from doing a workshop for deacons in the <unk> of hartford about ready to go to do a clergy convocation in calgary
you and sister ann recently did the clergy convocation with the <unk> of detroit so we are getting opportunities to really strengthen priests and deacons and give them courage and give them confidence you know in in preaching the gospel
and that's somewhat new you know what i mean we we've always done that overseas in different places but i think here in the states you you have done it more than the rest of us but it seems like the doors are kind of thrown wide open because they are recognizing it
so well you guys do have something god has given you something we want to listen to it we want you to come and help us out because i think we need it
yeah i think i think the church is waking up to the fact that you know what i think we need god yeah i think we need power from on high i think we need something more
you know because the the tsunami of <unk> is just <unk> people's lives and the statistics are just getting more and more grim and the decline of things
and we are trying to tell tell bishops and priests and deacons that you don't want to just kind of <unk> over decline and <unk> you want to generate a new energy of of <unk> and pentecost that can really turn the tide
and live the new pentecost
amen amen a culture of pentecost well peter ah we have so much to be grateful for one of the things we have to be grateful for is this booklet you have written which is called light in the darkness
jesus is the light in the darkness and we want you to have this booklet at no cost just for the asking and we will be back
friends we're living through difficult and challenging times the church is in a fierce battle
in the words of pope emeritus benedict the sixteenth man is pushing god from the human horizon and as a result the light which comes from god is disappearing and humanity is losing its bearings
in this moment it's crucial that we hear the words of jesus who said i'm the light of the world he who follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light
of life i wrote this short booklet to help you lay hold of this precious promise from jesus so you can have the strength and the courage you need to be a light in the darkness
to order your free copy of light in the darkness you can go to renewal ministries dot net or call one eight hundred two eight two four seven eight nine
well peter we've ah we've seen how the lord has worked with us but the lord wants to work with everybody like that you know
right
so i just like to tell you folks open yourself to the holy spirit ask god to give you the power and strength you need for your mission of being a witness for him in where you are

and simply banish those please admire some <unk> pearl scale and <unk> yes oh oh the tank show us all today have you guys ever heard of <unk> <unk> farm
they're based out of hawaii
and they're here at the show then they have a farm also and i think they have several now they had one in miami
um so they went to hawaii pick the best fish off the farm shipped them to miami and then the guys at the miami store brought them up to the show here
stunning the the farm in hawaii is huge make <unk> the best fish
i know you can't you can't see that very well
but it's just a sampling
ah that's the grade of japanese imported <unk> that they have they hand selected the best ones and they brought them up for the show
so ah and the prices ranged for the smaller ones we were looking at <unk> they were fifteen inch average size five hundred to a thousand dollars
but they were amazing they were some of the best <unk> i have ever seen in person and they're so cool because you can recognize a good-looking <unk>
i mean better than the average pawn variety which by the way i keep average pawn variety even though they're long thin beautiful <unk> they're just they're your basic pawn variety oh yeah look at this is that a cool shirt
that's the <unk> farm shirt that they brought self to show this is this is one of their ah grand champion fish that's a grand champion show of that fish is probably worth one hundred and fifty thousand dollars not more
everything about this show is cool if you watched any of my much earlier videos i set up a three hundred gallon stock tank of <unk> i bought some baby <unk> and grew them out over winter in a seventy-five gallon stocked pond
ah i really dig the <unk> so you can check out my <unk> videos i've got a playlist probably says something about <unk>
in the title ah let's see
hey third watch thanks a lot i appreciate that yeah i love my shirt yeah i'm sorry it doesn't show up better for you guys in this this scenario
we work with what we've got to work with right it's ten fifty to <unk> of you watching now thank you very much we're talking about the central florida <unk> goldfish show happening in orlando right now
oh
there are a couple of things we're not talking about and i appreciate you guys already not talking about it thank you very much moderators if you see things in there we don't want to talk about feel free to hide those common things
all right now i'm just i'm just glancing at chat occasionally ah
<unk> pond and rack and <unk> future it's almost like that guy's got a crystal ball that's working ah
yes i think you're right <unk> <unk> um if that happens we may have to have a fish to meet up around the river life <unk> pond it would be awesome i'd love to have you guys
<unk> <unk> is ah showing me some love by posting the river life at sea art page which ah recently had some editions put on it two weeks ago
or was it last week i showed you guys you guys got the sneak peak and then i put the
the paintings up on <unk> and i've got another
of paintings to add to there so paintings are still still coming around by the way i'll tell you fish art we got <unk> in the house
a certified fine artist unbelievable blow your mind or check out <unk> family wines art
chris at <unk> addiction also an artist um back in the studio i've got some of his art both prints and originals fantastic fish are priscilla n k who's often in the chat here
i've got some of her art and you know i'm at this show and the first person we talked to says hey look i bought these sketches of goldfish that my niece does oh the gorgeous goldfish sketches with with the colored pencils
i think that's a medium that chris and <unk> addiction uses also they had some of them framed they had some upper printed on coffee mugs just the coolest stuff
i think this fish art is really catching on because we fish keepers can appreciate it and it's a wonderful introduction to fish to people who don't have an aquarium they can have a a painting of a fish
and i think if we can connect the two um fish art to people who don't have <unk> to people who have fish art and <unk> we can teach them how to keep an aquarium at least efficiently if not easily
i think they really they <unk> um the enjoyment i have in my life i think they will other people too and it's a good mission that we're on to share our hobby with people
ah <unk> <unk> says
ah something about
its tennessee tradition to name <unk> fish bob
is that true
for me let me <unk> that
chad <unk> interrupting things here at the live stream with a non dollar <unk> cent super chat says sleep calls hope y'all have a good evening thanks for the stream right thank you chad <unk> for being here thanks for the super chat nine <unk> i appreciate that
yeah i'm gonna it's <unk> the quality of the fish so i'm able to afford tomorrow every time you guys do that thank you very much third one says fish are so beautiful it's perfect for our
<unk> said i totally <unk>
how about that is the audio still good i'm going to turn the volume down there i'm gonna drop these levels because it
it's jumping around here and there for a second so that was really peg and you guys
<unk> with a long oh i'm stone says i i probably knew that i i'd spoke it on the fly
and said <unk>
and <unk> living the dream i think she's helping out <unk> <unk>
says ah yes or fred
so so fred and bob as <unk> names know oddly enough i'm in tennessee and i don't have a <unk> named fred or bob
so i'm i'm missing out on the tennessee tradition of <unk> names
okay good gotta sounds better excellent
very good i didn't see any top dwelling asian fish i'm sure you guys i thought about the asian ah <unk> ah and of course the <unk> feed at the surface and so did the goldfish
so all those came to mind what about um asian mid swimmers
we go down a level and the water column and the community tank ah because it's ten <unk> <unk> of you still watching thank you it's almost eleven o'clock we're almost at the halfway point
we're down to the middle of the water column talking about the best asian fish for the middle of the water call and i noticed my <unk> also sometimes like to swim around
and the ah the middle of the water column they rest on the bottom that swim in the middle they speed on the top that's that's what i see
um by the way i did see some <unk> mona jump ahead here i'm gonna let's talk about the video first and i'll look for a photograph of a <unk> asian fish i want to show you guys um
the video that i put out tuesday we did the premiere thank you guys who showed that for the premiere
um
fish dreams hello just saw you over there in the chat shrimp <unk> i i escaped and <unk> a one point five gallon tiny bookshelf tank
and
oh it's a minute and eleven seconds video i don't know if i can
sure i can't for you guys i can't um
it's it's not performing at the rate that would like for it to it's falling below the average ah rate there's some really cool shrimp um
and i don't know i don't know exactly i don't have that algorithm figured out but i was a little surprised that it had such a wonderful premiere and you guys showed up and then the performance afterwards just seemed to slow
so hopefully it'll make the turn and pick back up the name of the video with shrimp <unk> i've got some freshwater shrimp blue shrimp
and ah <unk> <unk> they're like a they're like some blue fantasy dreams i used to have from flip <unk>
but i've got them from the local fish store who sold them as shrimp <unk>
so i purchase three blue <unk> <unk> and put them at one point five gallon
did a video loved the video those <unk> are such a cute little rascals
i think if you'll check that out you'll enjoy it the things got video since tuesday has one hundred <unk> reviews as at the time we went on air forty-eight likes so
it's it's a little slow out of the gate after it launched well that kind of slowed down on the gate so it's good video i hope you guys watch it let me know what you think
and now it is eleven o'clock let's get down to the bottom of the tank bottom of the water column and this is the point where we talk about the changes in the river life fish studio
and if you've been following along with us here in the community tank you know the fish studio is under construction but we're going very slow now waiting on some structural changes to the house so that's gonna happen when it happens
ah we've done it on a priority list we're getting closer every day but it's gonna be minor changes until the structural changes arrive and at that time we also talked about the fish at the bottom of the water column
so here's a video i made today
i think the striking goldfish but this vendor also had some bottom dwellers look at all the <unk> harpoon sharks look at all those little guys
they are couple hundred of those and i think those are outstanding <unk> asian fish they get up to three feet long
thirty thirty-six inches
and the vendor told me they could withstand temperatures down to negative twenty-two <unk> twenty-two degrees below zero amazing
so i think i'm gonna have to have a couple of those in my life i'm actually ordered
sharks before but ah half and <unk> sharks but they didn't derive ah i've had a couple of issues with getting them so i'm still without and here i am at the show and there are dozens if not hundreds
so i think there's gonna be one or two of those in my life
<unk> and paradise fish
huh
neither of which i associated previously as being asian i'm gonna look at that
that's funny all those beauties in the bathroom how does she do it
we're talking about simply <unk> fish true being in a bathroom
and simply <unk> says just go vertical vertical baby it's not difficult
alien world <unk> is in the house and before i forget again alien world let me say
and if you needed <unk> this and watch it on replay
the dart frogs i recommend for you are the larger terrestrial dart frogs the green and black dart frog
its scientific name
ah ends in <unk>
ah formerly was <unk> babies so they still used <unk> babies that's changed so many other genus <unk> babies are oddest and the <unk> <unk> babies <unk>
ah those are <unk> no they're awake during the day their call is a very soft buzz you have to have your ear to the tank if you want to hear the <unk> call and then thirdly the <unk> <unk>
the <unk> babies <unk> <unk> that's the <unk> or yellow and black poison dart frog and it has a very audible call it's a loud <unk> that reminds you of the jungle so it's pretty cool
but they don't have an on off switch okay so if you love it that's the one to go with but if you're not sure you're gonna like that jungle trail in your house during the day it won't bother you at night
but during the day you may want to steer clear of the local melon
but those are all larger beautiful and the <unk> sigh mentioned it's like blue and bright yellow and variants of both yellow back blue legs look them up online there's millions of um
photographs and of course on youtube there's lots of videos that's my recommendation for you stay away from the smaller thumbnail size frogs they're more <unk> more <unk> more demanding as far as environment goes
and the dealer that ah i have i don't know many i'm out of the loop but but one that i have confidence in is <unk> frogs
and he had no idea i was gonna say that this is not an advertisement <unk> sponsored ah just
i recognized some good customer service practices there and healthy frogs and great customer support so a terrestrial frog one of the three i mentioned i think are all great beginner frogs and an affordable price
um i actually did well with the <unk> which now is a <unk> of the <unk> it's just solid blue with black spots pretty amazing
anyway i'm glad that you're here thanks for hey <unk> tanks yeah
<unk> tanks is here poison dart frog god welcome <unk> and he says yes both tender babies so he's still the man in the <unk> there you there you go you have got alien world hookup <unk> tanks see what he's got going on
he may even be breeding by now thank tanks do you have any <unk>
fish <unk> in the house
<unk> dog <unk> dog warning please don't let the frogs that is always a good idea <unk> dog please don't look at the frogs
yeah and you remind me now encouraging alien to reach out to thank we'll get our dog dog frog people together you guys might talk me into getting some frogs i don't know
i don't know but if i did i'd do some of those larger terrestrial ones
it's my vacation cigar
i'm gonna be ah chewing on it for a minute
<unk> has got his frogs on cool down you gotta rest your frogs that's a good husbandry <unk> good husbandry
and <unk> tanks also recommends everyone needs frogs well it's true and some of us are fortunate enough to to experience having frogs
world aquarium singapore hello all fish lovers coming their support river life

next the world go around
okay ah i wanna bring you guys up to speed on a little something <unk> know eight eighty nine of you watching
um i'm i'm going forward with this um this fish art this um being an artist painting abstract fish
and so i've got a local gallery back home that has agreed ah to sponsor a <unk> show this summer so i do have a show coming up should be really cool
and i'll have some original art hanging in the show as well as some prints and it will be for sale it it's not a contract so i don't i don't have to alter my prices
and it must my ah my pricing scheme or shipping because of the gallery contract
ah but it is a <unk> show that will hang for a couple of months or it will be a really good local promotion kind of a feather and the camp kind of thing so i look forward to sharing that with you guys and if you've bought prints
um so know that a print that you own may be featured ah in a show a live show coming this summer over near mountain home tennessee
so i'm really looking forward to that as well as some other merch some river life merch featuring river life art
hats shirts mugs i may even already have a couple of mugs things like that so keep your eye out that's just the the single plug i wanna give the art tonight we're going to move on
and talk about
well i take that back we're going to expand that one point into i'm trying to figure out how to do a facebook auction a facebook live auction for the art i've set up the river life art facebook page
and that's hopefully um very soon to host a river life art auction i've got several small paintings i mean <unk> they're like sketches for larger paintings
i'm talking ah two inches square two by three inches three by four inches very small thumbnail paintings
that i think would be fun to auction and that would keep the price down that we could have some fun nobody would get hurt
so we're we're gonna talk about that um i'll probably will announce it here on a live stream one week and then we'll pick a day go ahead and be thinking of the day and tom that would be good for a facebook live auction
and i probably have
i don't know twenty years or so though every time i get an inspiration for a fish i end up doing a series of these little things where i test <unk> and how colors contrast with each other and shape and layout so
the the original painting that eventually comes from all this thoughts this conceptual work usually doesn't look exactly like the thumbnail but but then i have these small <unk> ah because we're on the way
the great about the art show says better time stories thank you <unk> posted the <unk> page thank you
and we'll pick a day a good day for an art auction for the the originals <unk> on canvas will will pick a day for the thumbnail auction

if you're just joining us we talked earlier about helping out one of our hard-working mods here <unk> <unk> is trying to get his channel <unk> and the best way to help him is by sharing his video
and the best way to share you can do it any way you like hit the share button click into one of your social media and and share it but the best way is to copy the link
and then go paste it in your social media of choice so it becomes content that originated
um in that social media in other words if you copy and paste the link on youtube and then go to facebook and um paste it in a post if it <unk> originally on facebook
facebook is gonna to give it more play than if you share it directly from youtube i don't know just just the way it works

this week we take to the turkey woods it was youth season in missouri and arkansas and the growing deer team jumps at every opportunity to take a kid hunting taking a young hunter can present some challenges
but the opportunity to introduce someone to creation through a hunting experience well that's priceless
twenty pounds one ounce that's good for him yeah
growing deer is brought to you by bass pro shops <unk> trophy rock eagle seed <unk> winchester dead down wind <unk> dirt lacrosse <unk> <unk> arrows
<unk> natives <unk> targets <unk> <unk> custom calls montana <unk> summit <unk> drake <unk> clothing <unk> <unk> r t p outdoors
l e m game processing fourth arrow g five <unk> prime bows and <unk> hunting blinds
<unk> youth season is two days long and always a week before the regular season opens anyone fifteen or younger is classified as a youth hunter rae is fourteen so adam rae and i were eager to head out saturday morning
we'd been using <unk> cameras to scout the proving grounds for several months now and we had a pretty good idea which <unk> and food plots turkeys were using as threat zones
based on studying <unk> pictures and videos there's one clover field on top of a ridge we call <unk> that seemed to have the most activity
<unk> youth season usually corresponds with the very early part of the turkey breeding season and at this time the hens are still in flocks but <unk> aren't far behind
the hens are pretty much on it get off the roost and feeding pattern daily they're not all spread out seeking <unk> habitat and it's a great time to pattern turkeys
about a week before youth season opened we moved a <unk> hay bale blind at the edge of the power line overlooking the clover food plot
we set out a miss perfect <unk> and settled in the blind way before daylight it was a really enjoyable time watching and listening till all the <unk> come to life as the sun peaked over the horizon
the three of us were listening to several <unk> <unk> in the distance but after a while three birds fired up what we assumed to be about two hundred yards in front of us and we knew those were the <unk> we were after
so it's fun listening to <unk> when you know the terrain and trying to imagine where they are as these <unk> started closing the distance adam and i both agreed they were really close to a <unk> blind
that was about one hundred and fifty yards in front of us just over the hill and through some timber
i couldn't really tell if they were moving toward us or kind of just going back and forth on the ridge adam hit the call one more time and there was no doubt in my mind those <unk> had committed and were coming our way
listening to them gobble we thought they were right on the ridge top and it wasn't long till we saw those white heads coming down the logging road
i see them
three
can i shoot one
i'll be shooting the goal from
he's too close
okay
you nailed him rae
look at him watch him
that's a big one rae
i didn't <unk>
no you were perfect you nailed him
whoa some good hooks rae
yeah
good spurs look at those
um <unk>
that's a little longer they're both good probably a three-year-old bird
ah <unk>
and oh man look at that
um it's really long
well they are beautiful feathers aren't they
yeah they look kind of bluish
yep and this
boy you've <unk> his head
he didn't flop around much did he
nope
well
get him out here where we can take some pictures and go back and take him to the house
definitely
rae made a great shot and that tom barely <unk> we got out and inspected the turkey shared some hugs and talked about the hunt after we kind of settled down a little bit and we've taken a few pictures
i stepped off from the turkey back to the hay bale blind and it was forty-eight steps forty-eight yards i gotta tell you before we started using winchester long beard x r i would have never given her the okay to take that shot
but through <unk> and experience i was fully confident she'd take that tom down
based on the spur length about an inch and three <unk> the tom is probably three years old that's a good tom anywhere but it was an even better hunt the birds <unk> good responded to the call and there was plenty of excitement as they were approaching
more importantly it was just a fun hunt to share with my daughter rae
after every successful hunt i like to take a little time and see what the <unk> has been eating i call this scouting from the <unk> shed
twenty-three and a half twenty-three and a half good tom for the ozarks and it's an easy ten a little bit over ten inches on the beard
sharing a hunt with family and friends is really important and just as important is properly preparing the meat we all should be thankful when we harvest game and that natural source of meat to feed our families the first thing to do of course is remove the beard
so i just put my hand at the base and give it a good tug
and there it is nice full beard turn the turkey up right where his <unk> is to me and i just wanna open up and see what's in his crop probably not much because we called this turkey right off the roost we could hear him in a tree hear him hit the ground
different call sound or a different volume anyway so i doubt he's fed much but we'll see
and i wanna cut out away from the feathers if you cut in you're gonna get feathers all over the meat
and you can tell where it's still very early in their breeding season look at all this fat in a week or two if we harvest a tom i predict it won't have near as much fat as now
and you also notice still full of breast feathers that means they're not breeding much yet they haven't worn those breast feathers off so it kind of gives you a good gauge of where the local turkey population is in the breeding cycle
this turkey of course came off the roost and it's so empty i'm feeling right here and there's nothing in his crop when i opened up the crop in the tom rae harvested there was nothing in it
apparently that old tom came off the roost and started working right toward our setup
usually when you open up a <unk> stomach or a <unk> crop there's great information that tells us where turkeys are spending time eating but when you shoot a tom that came to you right off the roost often time there will be nothing in his crop
pro staffers heath and lindsey martin also had the opportunity to take a youth hunting this past weekend they went on a youth hunt set up by scott hook of <unk> custom calls the hunt was organized in north central arkansas
once they arrived in camp they met up with scott and their youth hunter gracie <unk> <unk> thirteen and has tagged a few deer but never been able to tag a turkey
so what are you most excited about for the weekend
um probably tomorrow morning just getting out there and being able to hear all of them hopefully get a new turkey
does have you ever had a chance to hear very many turkeys
um one
once okay
would you like to add any pressure to mister martin about getting you a bird tomorrow do you know he feels a lot of pressure to get you a bird
i'm feeling a lot of pressure to shoot the bird
after introductions and getting to know each other they headed over to the farm where they were going to hunt and did a little scouting
the next morning is the opening day but during the night a strong cold front came in and bring with a very high winds and apparently gave all the turkeys <unk>
after a couple hours of walking around and calling they can't hear any turkeys responded to the high wind so he decides he need to find a high spot that's out of wind and see if they can hear a turkey respond
after forty-five minutes they had a turkey respond and now they're hurrying to get set up
even though this tom <unk> at every call heath threw at him he wouldn't close the distance
we were sitting here talking about our border border <unk> and labs and mister heath decided to call a little bit and we had a <unk> a lonely <unk> gobble back at us and we got set up then got our <unk> out
and about that time we just couldn't get him to come in
so now what's the plan
well i got a <unk> this evening so we gotta leave a little early and go to the <unk> and then hopefully we'll get out here in the morning
that tom wouldn't commit to come to the calls and gracie had prior obligations that afternoon so heath took gracie back to camp and met up with scott hook and spent the afternoon hunting with scott and his youth hunter <unk>
here with my young hunter <unk> cook and his grandfather mitchell some friends told us of an area that birds like to hang out <unk> we're gonna try to slip in there and set up and just sit around and listen call a little bit and maybe we can get him a shot
a few minutes into the property they had a cool interaction with a hen and even though this hen was very <unk> no <unk> responded
they ended up moving further in the property and having a <unk> respond to their calls they scrambled to get set up but this tom worked his way in silently and wouldn't give <unk> a good shot
it was a fun day with some good interactions but neither gracie or <unk> tagged a turkey but they were ready to go the next morning
multiple birds were <unk> that evening so a second youth hunter joined gracie the next morning
<unk> group set up close to the roost site and one of the birds responded but simply didn't present a good shot through all the brush in the area
the wind has started to lay a little bit but we're we're still at it we're we're bound and determined we're gonna get one
after that first set up the group was working hard to get gracie on a tom before her deadline to leave for church
they got on another tom and got their <unk> set up and with a little calling it sounds like that tom is closing the distance
bird down congratulations gracie on your first turkey
good job how exciting was that
it was pretty good
i could just hear shoot shoot shoot so i just tried to get a shot off
shoot shoot
i bet they were
all i could hear
like there was a chant in the forest i bet people on the road could hear everybody shoot shoot shoot
high five
thank you for calling my bird in for me
thank you i sure do appreciate you all
congratulations
there's one on the back of it
after all the celebration scott does a great job of explaining why it's important to introduce youth to hunting
um it requires patience requires a little understanding knowledge of your your adversary in the woods if if you get down to the most basic things of turkey hunting it can really teach you some lessons in life
and i'm still trying to learn the patience thing that still hasn't stuck with me yet
where you managed to get a bird this morning miss gracie killed a bird this morning
there's a lot of emotions involved in taking anyone hunting youth or adult new or experienced hunter there is enjoying creation there's the potential and the follow through of taking the life of another <unk>
and there's the joy of providing quality food for your family i can't think of any better tool than hunting for teaching life's lessons
thanks to heath lindsey and scott for volunteering their time to introduce several youth to hunting this past weekend in arkansas
during the same weekend matt tagged along with seth <unk> and his son trace during <unk> youth season
trace was excited as last season he took his first <unk>
dude that's a good shot buddy
this year trace was set on taking a long beard and seth and matt were more than willing to help him meet that goal
the morning started out great as the guys got some turkeys fired up off the roost
sure enough two long <unk> entered the plot strutting spitting drumming and <unk> they put on quite a show
yeah that's awesome ain't it do not move a lot until they get in front of your gun barrel
one of the challenges of taking a youth hunting is getting them set up right and predicting where the turkey is going to approach
why why didn't i just point the gun down the logging road when we got here and i seen them coming up the road i was like
why am i set up like this
did you ever think it
not until they got right there and i'm like okay i'm good and they move it's like oh
i i thought they were just gonna come out see the <unk> and just <unk> right to them but
he was about ready to just shake off
i was i i got cause
he s in the frame and i could see the gun going
this hunt was a great example of not having a youth hunter pointed the right direction due to the unpredictability of turkeys even though it didn't work out with a tagged turkey it was a great start to their hunt
yep
turkeys would have been dead
one reason we've been experiencing some great turkey <unk> here at the proving grounds is our intensive predator management program
we've worked for years to balance the predator and prey populations we use trapping to reduce the amount of predators and the results of that have been very high survival rates of turkey <unk> and <unk>
there's another benefit to trapping and that's acquiring the beautiful <unk> i saved up some <unk> for a couple years and had miss tracy a beautiful raccoon blanket made with a <unk> trim
i love to turkey hunt so every year we catch several raccoons here at the proving grounds and people often ask what do you do with all those <unk> well raccoon <unk> make a beautiful gift and there's lots of things you can do
but this year i went above and beyond i took several of the <unk> that were about the same size that i had caught in previous years and i had miss tracy a beautiful
large raccoon blanket made
and how about those <unk> <unk> we catch had a <unk> buffer put on the outside
blankets made out of <unk> kept native americans warm for centuries this one at least based on what i've seen in museums is probably a little bit more refined
the process was really simple of course we trapped the predators skinned <unk> and dried the <unk> had a <unk> prepare them at a garment tan or a very soft had another <unk> produce this beautiful blanket
now that there's fewer predators at the proving grounds both me lots of turkeys and <unk> will sleep better this spring
i surprised tracy with this blanket and she was thrilled it's an absolutely gorgeous addition to our home and no doubt will keep us warm for many winters to come
each week i share a reminder with all of us to slow down and listen to the <unk> daily i can't think of a better way than sitting on a <unk> before daylight waiting for turkeys to gobble
but no matter where you are i hope you take time to enjoy creation this week and slow down every day and listen to what the <unk> is saying to you thanks for watching growing deer
okay
hey hey i'm conor <unk> tsar and welcome back to another video i'm traveling here in poland i'm going to be traveling to the two most visited cities that is warsaw here in the capital and <unk>

hey this is <unk> from liberty to travel dot com welcome to my <unk> review
i'm here inside the dashboard of this new software by joshua <unk> and han fan
and during this review i'm gonna give you a walk through of the software show you a bit of the different features inside and what you can do with them
i'm also going to go over to sales page of this product and have a look at the claims being made on the sales page to see if the product lives up to those claims
and i've put together a package of custom an exclusive bonuses that you'll be able to get when you buy <unk> through the link and description below this video
so click on the link that will take you to this page on my website you can watch the rest of the review here if you like
and when you purchase <unk> through any of the green buttons on this page you'll be able to get my bonuses free of charge after your purchase
during this review i will also cover the up sales of <unk> what they are what they cost and what you can expect with them but first let's have a look at my bonuses and how they help you with <unk>
now <unk> is a platform that will allow you to post content other people's content on social media
and then use those ah that content to a build your list or make affiliate sales
now with these bonuses you're going to be doing even better with this software so the first bonus is how to build your list of buyers on facebook
in this bonus i cover my strategy for finding proven buyers of products on facebook
and then adding them either to your friends list to your pages or to your groups and then you can use a software like <unk> to promote your offers to those people
so this goes really really well together with <unk> obviously with <unk> you're going to be able to post on facebook
but if you don't already have a targeted group of people to post too then ah you're not gonna get a lot of results
with this you'll be able to get results really quickly
because you already have proven buyers on your facebook friends list or in your facebook groups and then those people are much more likely to follow your offers that you gonna be posting with <unk>
bonus number two is how to write killer headlines now if you gonna post on social media or you wanna buy um build your email list one thing you absolutely need to be able to do is get people's attention
now there's no better way to get someone's attention than with a really good headline
the problem is it could could take you months of trying to learn <unk> to write effective headlines yourself
while however if you do what i do you just go to the best <unk> in the world find out what kind of headlines they write
and then model your own headlines based on those headlines you'll be able to take a shortcut and do this in just minutes
now in bonus number two i show you exactly where to go to find this killer headlines and then how to use those to base your own headlines on them
bonus number three is all about how to pick a good niche now with <unk> you can actually do affiliate marketing in almost any niche
however you do have to pick a good niche for you to be able to actually make money with it
so in bonus number three i cover what good niches are when it comes to affiliate marketing and how to decide which one to pick for yourself
bonus number four is my email marketing fundamentals course
now with <unk> as i said one of the things you can do is build your email list with this traffic that you're going to be generating with the software
after you start building your email list of course you wanna know what to actually do with that email list
ah first of all which software you can use to collect your leads how to set that up
and then also how to write effective emails to those people on your list so you can actually turn the leads into sales now all of that is covered inside my email marketing fundamentals course
so that is bonus number four
and then bonus number five last but not least my facebook retargeting course
now if you're going to be using <unk> traffic ah one way you can easily double your results with very very minimal budget is by adding facebook retargeting on top of it
now i use facebook retargeting in my own business and every time i do i see my results go up so much more
because let's face it even if ah fifty percent of the people that visit your website sign up your mailing list
which obviously isn't going to happen it's probably a lot less than that it's probably like twenty percent but even then you're losing half of your traffic
now when you do facebook retargeting you get another chance to target those people who didn't initially sign up
and get them onto your email list or get them to buy a product from you or a affiliate product that you are promoting
so this will allow you to <unk> all those people that leave your website without taking action maybe they were just busy at that time maybe they didn't have time to look at your offer in more detail but they might still be interested
now with facebook retargeting you have the chance to recapture those people get them onto your email list or ah get them to buy a product from you and this will definitely double your results
now on top of my own bonuses i'm also going to give you access to all of the bonuses that the vendor provided me with to give to you
now these bonuses are probably what all the other affiliates are going to be offering you
and because i know that my bonuses are one of the best in the industry i don't want you to miss out on these vendor provided bonuses and i'm including those as well on top
so bonus number one the vendors provided me with is a live ninety minute training and q and a session bonus two is <unk> profitable niches
bonus three <unk> product types that sell and bonus four six steps to instagram traffic success
so those are bonuses that will be on top of my own bonuses ah for <unk> when you purchase through the link and description below this video
now on top of that when you purchase any of the upgrades to <unk> i will also give you affiliation of my full affiliate marketing course
now in this course i teach you exactly how i make between <unk> and <unk> dollars a day every single day with affiliate marketing
now to prove that i'm not lying about that let me just quickly log into my j v zoo account and my warrior plus account to show you the kind of results i'm getting
so today has only just started as i'm recording this not much there yet but yesterday <unk> on j v zoo and another <unk> <unk> on warrior plus
plus some more in some other networks so altogether well over <unk> dollars in commissions for me yesterday
and that is with the techniques i show inside my affiliation affiliate marketing course
so that is available when you purchase <unk> with any of the upgrades available to <unk>
now as i said i'll cover those upgrades later during the review so stay tuned for that but when you do get them you'll get that bonus on top
now all of these bonuses will automatically be delivered inside your j v zoo account after your purchase
all you need to do is log in to j v zoo click on looking for my purchases at the top right hand corner of your screen
find your receipt for <unk> and then at the bottom of your receipt just scroll down all the way you will find a button that says bonuses from <unk>
that is where my five bonuses will be waiting for you
now if you purchased any of the upgrades and you want to get my affiliate marketing course just email me to <unk> at liberty to travel dot com and i will get back to you with that link as well on top
so let's have a look inside the dashboard of this software and let me walk you through some of the features
so first of all the dashboard that looks like this you can see an overview of how many things you have running at the moment inside the software of course
there's a support link of course where you can um get in touch with the support team for <unk> if any thing isn't working out for you
and then the tutorials where you can see different videos on exactly how to use the software
so here you can see the tutorial videos adding accounts and groups creating a content stream
creating and adding stories to a content bucket connecting a <unk> and <unk> those are two email marketing platforms that you can use together with <unk> so you can start building your list with it
also adding amazon associate tags if you want to do amazon affiliate marketing with the software then there's built in features for that as well adding amazon products
adding <unk> i'll show you later what that means adding custom domains if you want to set this up on your own domain you can do that creating a campaign and checking your campaign stats
so those are all training videos included but let me just quickly give you a walk through of the software
so social accounts this is where you add your own social accounts so you can add a facebook pages twitter ah ah the
i can't show you right now with all the options are but there's ah few different social accounts available so there is facebook twitter um
yeah it's facebook ah and twitter those are the two social media platforms
and then on facebook you can choose pages groups or your own personal account so then you post on your newsfeed
so those are the three different facebook ah options and then there's twitter of course so those are the social accounts available
so here you can see all the different account so i added one of my own facebook pages so i can post to that
then ah here we have account groups so that will allow you to ah put accounts together in a group and then you can post to multiple accounts at the same time
so if you want to post in a facebook on a facebook page in a facebook group and on your twitter account with ah with the same content
then you can group them together with the software and then it will send that same content to all those accounts
ah so content streams that is where you get your automated content so here we have an example of a contents stream now it is for weight loss
i can't currently add another stream right now because the software isn't live yet it's gonna go live at eleven a m and i'm recording this a few hours before
so right now i'm not able to add more content streams because they're working on it
but ah there's one here already as an example unfortunately the key word chosen for weight loss wasn't weight loss but weight so the content is a little bit weird
but let me show you because that basically covers so much ah so many different things use weight in their text
so this doesn't cover just weight loss it's like here there is like some play station four game review um
i don't know like automotive global industry so this is like a financial report on the automotive industries
so as i said there's like a lots of different weird stuff going on here but what this would normally do if you put in a more proper keyword like how to lose weight that would've been way better
then you can see all sorts of articles from all over the web on how to lose weight now we're not going to steal these articles all we're doing is linking directly
to the original content to the original article but then we're gonna be able to put our own affiliate ah link or ah list
building pop up on top of that so what you can do you can add this content to a bucket
and then you have these buckets over here so let me show you what that is so we here we have a bucket
then i can go click on view and then you see all the different articles that are currently in the bucket
now if you don't like the articles that the content streams came up with and you want to use your own articles that you find anywhere on the web
you can just enter u r l here and that will add a custom article from anywhere on the internet to your bucket
so if i go for example to ah c n n dot com ah or let do c n n world news
and then um here just grab this and then what's going on beyonce performs at this party
so then you just copy paste this article ah and then i can go into <unk> for here add this to the story
or add the story to the ah bucket and then ah it should be in here somewhere
i guess it's on the next page oh on this is the one <unk> <unk> wedding included special performance by beyonce so i just added that as a extra story on in my bucket of stories
but this bucket is automatically filled by stories from your content streams when you set those up as well
then <unk> that's ah as i said <unk> is basically ah where the money is this is the main functionality of the software
so obviously getting this content is part of it but then once you have the content what do you do with it how do monetize it well we're going to use it either to build our list or to send people to affiliate offers with its content
so what you can do with this <unk> let me see if i can add more of those yeah
so you can either add a bar a pop up a notification a full screen pop up or an amazon product on top of that content
so let me just set up a pop up in this case and then we have a different pop ups that we can choose
um so let's do this call to action one then you can see um so this would be directing people directly to an affiliate offers
so let's not choose at that one but let's choose one that is to build our list so that would be opt in then um we can say join our community we can give a discount code
so you can see all these different templates they have already created so that makes it super easy to get started with this
so this is a good list building pop up in my opinion because it's pretty basic and simple yet at the same time very eye catching
ah so now you could change of course all of the text over here um so i can just type my own and i will change the headline over here
now this of course is one reason why i'm including my bonus number two on how to write killer headlines because you're going to have to create your own headline in this pop up
and you want to make sure that this is a catchy headline that people are going to want to opt in to your list um for
so this is a headline that really intrigues people and makes them want to know more about what you're talking about and then as a consequence they'll sign up to your list
so that is why i'm including bonus number two all about ah how to write those killer headlines
ah so there we go that is that ah you can change this logo thing here you can change the button ah even the color of it
so you have a lot of options you can ah add a delay so ah your <unk> isn't shown immediately when people open the page but after a few seconds
so i can say like five seconds for example you can say ah just show up at the bottom left corner the bottom right corner
or ah the top left or the top right as well so that is like on the page if you have the whole page
then it can like pop up here or can pop up here or can pop up from the top like that um so that is how that works
ah you want to the close button to show or not background settings so this is white right now but you can make it any color really and then it's like that really ugly
ah so let's leave it white so form email address callback u r l so this would be your thank you page so this is another opportunity to make money with this
so when people enter their email address and they opt in then you can send them directly to an affiliate offer so that's another opportunity for you to make money with this
you can put in an affiliate ah affiliate link right here and then people are going to see that offer right after they enter ah their email address and sign up to your list
so that is another way you can ah okay then auto responder this is where you would connect your <unk> or <unk> count
so let me set that up so let me save this i don't know if i can no because i have to give it a title so ah title test one
save
okay now i go to auto responders so you can see test a r <unk> so i can change that i can add my own
auto responder
so here i could ah select a different list okay now it's gonna go to <unk> and get me to sign in i don't actually have an active <unk> account cause i am using <unk> right now
so i hope i can just cancel this no i can't go to my <unk> okay here we go
so this is where you would normally ah log in to your <unk> or <unk> account
give ah <unk> permission to use that account so that they can add their email the email addresses of all the people who sign up on that pop up to your own auto responder lists
now in addition to that as i said you can also add amazon products
so here for example ah you can add it an iphone and then you can have a pop up showing that iphone as a product
so if you don't wanna build your list you don't wanna have your own website you don't wanna do anything yourself
you just wanna like sent people to ah different pieces of content on on social media
and then give them different amazon offers as ah as your affiliate promotions you can do that with this software as well that may make you some quick money
it's not gonna be a super profitable long term business but it could definitely make you some quick cash with this
so if you just want to <unk> make your investment into <unk> back
then ah just putting out a ton of different content with amazon pop ups could be a great way to immediately make some money with amazon affiliate marketing
so those are the different ah options for <unk> and that is basically how this works
so don't we have the different posting campaigns um i'm not sure i can do this right now okay yes maybe i can so test
ah post to here bucket posting from this bucket per day one
unable overlay so that i can choose which overlay
pop up give away opt in sure posting times ah okay so now i don't even know what <unk> this is in so i'm gonna say all the time but
i don't know if this gonna post directly though so i let me just double check that on facebook opening this page
to see if it already posted something but i think this is gonna post like once a day so probably not gonna happen immediately
so this is the page i added and oh it did okay cool so i posted that article that i just grabbed from c n n
ah um it doesn't actually have an image because i had to add my own image because it couldn't grab the image from c n n but you can see it did post this
now this link is not the actual link to c n n it is a link to <unk> and here it should show the article on c n n
ah but it seems that this one no longer exists for some reason that's a bit weird but it does go to the c n n website as you can see
and ah over here we now have the pop up the overlay that we created showing up
so this is not the one i created just now this is another one just i picked from the list of <unk> available and you can see free report <unk> <unk> <unk> and then you can sign up here
and then you can click on send me report but you can also close this and then you would have access to this content and you can just go to home ah
i don't know why that doesn't work c n n style here we go
seems the c n n website is not really working while inside an <unk> so that's probably not the best of the best websites to work ah to use with <unk>
but if we grab any of the other articles ah i don't know if i can get a link from the other ones
can i see a preview somewhere you see
this is one of those bar previews
here we go view yes this is possible okay
so that's another example okay but this goes directly to the article on men's health as you can see ah men's journal in this case
so it doesn't show the <unk> pop up unless it is being posted on social media like this so ah i can't show you an example of another website right now
ah so let's ignore that and go back to the software so that is the last thing
ah the campaigns is basically where you set up when the article is posted when the articles are posted on social media what accounts are posted to
ah i can't add any more as well because it's on pause right now as i said
so here we go target account ah which accounts which ah do you want buckets or single articles
ah and do you want a certain amount of posts per day or per week or per month
so i can say i want ten posts per day and it just keeps posting ten times a day ah and then you can say which times does it post that do you want to enable <unk>
then you choose ah which overlay u r l type there's only one option default so i guess that's just what you choose
then ah post with overlay so how many of your posts do to have those <unk>
so you can say like i don't want to spam people with those pop ups all the time so i also want to have some relevant content without any promotions
so i can just show the pop ups on fifty percent of my posts
and then you can choose which overlay to use so you can add several so then it <unk> between those different <unk> that you set up
so those are the options and then you can just post that so that is how you can get the actual program to start
and then it just automatically work so you don't have to do any thing any more after that it just keeps posting content to your facebook or twitter accounts or both in case you've set up
as i said a group of accounts and it will have ah all these different articles that it <unk> from all these different content websites obviously not c n n because that one doesn't work so well
but any other content website ah that does work well i'm assuming that the content streams that actually automatically get content they use website where it works <unk>
it's just that the c n n website seems to block ah <unk> on their own website
and then of course it puts ah pulls all that different content and then post it on your social media
and then when people click on those different links they will be presented with your pop ups with your <unk>
ah so they they can sign up to your list or go to your affiliate offers and you directly make money with that content
so this is how you can use <unk> to basically automatic automatically drive free traffic targeted traffic to your offers
now obviously you will need ah a following on those social media which is bare bonus number one
that i'm including comes in really handy because that will allow you to add tons and tons of targeted buyer followers on facebook to your groups to your pages or ah to your friends list
and then they will be the people who see those posts that your <unk> is making on autopilot and then you're going to have tons and tons of targeted traffic to your offers
so that is <unk> and how it works let's have a quick look at the sales page where did i put it over here
so are you finally ready for a reliable and automated way to profit from the social giants
ah new web app creates fully automated social marketing campaigns in minutes by leveraging other peoples authority content for unlimited <unk> traffic leads and profit in any niche
without having to pay for ads without any s e o without needing a website or hosting and it's a simple as create schedule profit
so as you saw that it ah didn't require my own website because i was basically using others other websites to ah get the content
i also didn't need any s e o obviously because that would only be required when you have your own website
you don't have to pay for ads as you can just post this on a free organic social media accounts
so yeah this this is all pretty ah pretty legit stuff
um so getting unlimited leads and profit obviously will require um you to have a target that following as i mentioned before
but then bonus number one is gonna help you with that so generate massive traffic leads and sales in any niche from social dot giants on complete autopilot
so here you see connect your desired social accounts input your target keywords you'd like content for and set up your content stream et cetera
so i'm not gonna go through the rest of the whole sale page it's very long what i suggested you do if you want to check it out just click on the link and description below this video then click on any of the green buttons over here
and that will take you to the sales page and you can have a look at the rest of it yourself at your own pace in your own time
and read through all of these different content about this software and also see a few more examples of how this works really really well with the software
so let's have a look at the pricing so these are the two different options for initial purchase <unk> light and <unk> pro those are the two options
these are not going to be <unk> or <unk> dollars those are going to be the prices after the launch
so the launch is gonna start today the eleventh of december twenty eighteen at eleven a m e s t
that is when the price will be at its possible lowest point <unk> or <unk> dollars offered a light or the pro version
so the differences are light is limited to facebook only so no twitter on light
you can get ad to facebook pages have a total of five campaigns and five content streams per month
with pro you get both facebook and twitter you get ten pages ten twitter accounts twenty campaigns and a total of twenty content streams per month
so that is a lot more with pro and it's only ten bucks more so is probably a good idea to grab pro if you wanna get a lot of traffic from this method
then if you want unlimited pages twitter accounts unlimited <unk> and unlimited content streams you're gonna need to buy upgrade number one now
upgrade number one is the unlimited agency license for ah <unk> you can choose either a monthly payment of <unk> dollars or a quarterly payment of <unk> dollars
now considering that gives you three months for only ten bucks more it doesn't really make any sense to get the monthly payments because you end up paying almost three times as much
so make sure you get the quarterly for <unk> dollars and you'll also be able to set this up for your clients
so if you are an agency if you ah do digital marketing for clients then you can use <unk> to drive traffic to their offers so you can offer this as a service
and then it doesn't matter anymore that you're paying <unk> dollars per quarter for this cause you can charge your clients like a hundred bucks a month
and even with just one client you'll be able to charge <unk> bucks per quarter and you're only paying <unk> to offer him this service this makes this a really really good deal
that <unk> <unk> is upgrade number two that is <unk> dollars this allows you to <unk> your campaign with custom domains
and this is a for those of you who want to sell this as a service especially so that it ah you you can use your own agency's domain
and then it looks like you're offering the service and it's not just some service from <unk> that you're <unk>
because then your clients might just go to <unk> directly and skip you as an <unk>
so if you're gonna do that you can basically <unk> <unk> give it any name you want or the name of your own agency and that is a one time payment of <unk> dollars allow you that function
then overlay template bundle ah <unk> ah a lot of extended template so you saw inside <unk> it had a couple of different templates for these <unk>
now if you want a tone more <unk> then for <unk> dollars you can pick up o t o number three that gives you a lot more templates for your <unk>
and that's only a one time payment as well so that is a great deal as well
so as i said when you do purchase any of those upgrades you will get my full affiliate marketing course affiliation on top as an extra bonus
but if you purchase <unk> whether you purchase the light or pro version these five bonuses that i mentioned before will be waiting for you in your j v zoo account for free
after your purchase through the link in the description below this video so go and check that out

it is halloween night so i think there's a lot of energy in the air
i think you get this i've i've watched videos of you walking into restaurants together as a family i've have seen you walk in alone i've seen there seems to be this feeling when you walk around the country and people go
it's a little bit like ah but it's also like yeah like that that's that's a cool it's i mean it's not the presidency but as a cool consolation prize no
true yeah yeah it it it does um make up for it a little bit
um chelsea thank you very much for being here you came from <unk> like now
yes
you literally just went <unk>
literally
but you didn't you didn't dress up like anything you just took the kids <unk>
took the kids um we had a <unk>
right
ah a <unk> from <unk>
okay
and a pumpkin
oh i like this i like this and cause like if you if you came to my door on halloween i will be like oh my god you you dress as chelsea clinton that's amazing
amazing i never really thought that i'm like a built in halloween costume
you have a built in halloween people are like it's chelsea clinton then you're like no it's good makeup though right yeah it's a good good time
you know sometimes people say to us you know do you know you look just like hillary clinton and i say yeah i've heard that
let me um say first of all congratulations on a phenomenal book i didn't know what to expect the book of <unk> women
i didn't know it was gonna be a book about american women a book about political women but it it's just a book about women who have changed not just their world but the world in some way shape or form
what's interesting is that you wrote it together you've written many books separately but this was your first book writing together as mother and daughter
for someone who's written a book without my mother i can't imagine what are we like to write something with my mother
how do you how do you not to hate each other at this point what is the process like
ah it was a lot of fun ah it also they did take some adjustment ah because ah my mother still writes <unk>
like like write out the words
i said in this event i can see ah like a teenager up in the <unk> turned to his mother and say what's <unk>
<unk> this is the generation that goes what is that writing the words out with a pen and no auto correct
no and like no ability to track changes or have comment boxes
and you're doing it like are you doing it on a computer
yes like <unk>
how do you so how do you compare the notes then when when you like do you do do you bring the <unk> into the digital or do do you like give it to her and be like you <unk> my work
well so my mother would take photographs of like each page and then text or email me the photographs of the page yeah so
like when we were particularly working on the things that we wrote together like we write about rosa parks and <unk> colvin together
so i would like type up my <unk> colvin essay and send it to her as an attachment like a word document
and she would take pictures of like each individual page of her rosa parks essay and like send me like page one
i can feel your frustration as you telling me the story this this is nuts i can i can feel that
um why did you choose to write this book together i mean you've had many opportunities you could have written about anything your family politics your life
but this is a specific book and it feels like for specific time why
because we really believed that ah in today's world ah the stories of <unk> women and literally there are many millions of them
but we chose <unk> ah to write about
ah because their stories tell us yes about the struggles that they endured
and their persistence to try to improve their own lives and lives of people around them
but i think especially in today's world we need to be reminded of these kinds of stories ah and they are historic and contemporary and even a few fictional
and they were women who inspired me as a little girl and then throughout my life and the same with chelsea and
in fact we started talking about you know inspirational women when she was a little girl
and so we want to share these stories and we hope that people can find some um some message ah that will help them
right
especially you know given the difficulties that a lot of a lot of people around the world face right now
it's interesting chelsea because you you've said you know there was a time in your life when you watched your mom running for president and there were more women in space than running for president
two
rights and now you you have a plethora women i mean you have six in the race and you've seen how many women participated in in the midterms and won as well
do you feel like we're noticing a shift in society that's positively moving us to a place where there's equality not there yet but just moving us in that direction
i think we're absolutely making progress i also really appreciate how you frame the question trevor because it's super important that we don't get complacent
and that we also understand still how far we have to go
i mean even though he had an unprecedented number of women ran for congress in <unk> we were still less than a quarter of all declared candidates
wow
so making progress but we still have a long ways to go to get to parity but as we've seen like who runs for office really matters cause it determines who holds office
and i'm so thrilled that my children are growing up with the most diverse congress in american history
you have chosen <unk> women in this book who all have different stories of being <unk> but what would you find was the common thread that made them who they are
one i think the sense of just deep purpose sometime something that they knew from when they were little girl
like jane <unk> always knew she wanted to work with animals and sally ride you know the first american woman in space
um really became a physicist because she wasn't a good enough tennis player so she can found her passion later in life
but what is so distinctive that all these women is that they brought others along with them
sometimes consciously breaking down barriers and sometimes just really aware of their example
and i find that really powerful and <unk> that it wasn't just for themselves it was for others too
hillary i have to ask you a question that is been <unk> me for a while how did you kill jeffrey epstein
because you you you're not in power but you have all the power
i i really need to understand how you do what you do
because you seem to be behind everything nefarious and yet you do not use it to become president what is the game plan
well trevor
what does it but honestly what does it feel like being the <unk> of the rights
ah well ah it's it's a constant surprise to me
because the things they say and now of course it's on steroids with ah being online
ah are so ridiculous ah beyond any imagination than i could have
and yet they are so persistent in putting forth these crazy ah ideas and theories
honestly i don't know what i ever did to get them so upset
um but a lot of them live to come up with these conspiracy ah theories
and you know i've gotten kind of used to it it's been going on for a number of years
have you have you ever thought of just like meeting someone who says hillary you did this and just looking at them being like yes i did
i mean there there must be right at some point it it becomes so ludicrous and become so extreme
well i've had i've had i've had encounters like that and and many of my friends have had because
wow
yeah they've called up people to urge them to like vote for me
or they've knocked on a door and somebody will say oh i couldn't do that because and then they launch into one of their big conspiracies
and i had one friend one very dear friend who i literally have known my entire life and she said she listened to this ridiculous ah conspiracy about me
and she said you know i've known her since we were in sixth grade and none of that is true and this man looked at her and said but i saw it on the internet
well i also think it's because it is effective like i'll never forget reading an article after the <unk> election
where the reporter interviewed someone who had been an undecided voter
and he said you know he thought my mom had won all three debates she clearly had a greater command of the subject matter and yet he just kept reading that she had murdered more than fifty people
and he said somewhat <unk> like i don't think that she murdered fifty but like what if she murdered two
and so you just think it's this like constant erosion of of truth and sanity
right
but my favorite and the one that i do secretly hope may be true is that my mother apparently adopted an alien in <unk> and i've always wanted sibling
so i hope maybe maybe that one will prove after some point
trevor it it's you have to laugh at because it's so crazy but on the other hand we face a serious problem
ah a lot of these falsehoods and these crazy stories are taking on lives of their own
not about me but about everybody particularly anybody in the public arena
and i have been um very outspoken about the decision by facebook to allow truly false political ads to be run
i want to applaud twitter for announcing they were not going to let that ah go forward and i hope ah i really hope facebook changes their mind
because more than half the people in america get their news from facebook and you i mean that's
well but no but facebook but facebook is is is a real issue and we are living in a world where people no longer know what truth is and don't even agree on which which seems to be a larger issue
you've witnessed the change in politics through many different times
ah in fact we're in an interesting period now where the country is gearing up for impeachment
and you are in an interesting position where in your life you have been literally a part of every single impeachment in some way shape or form
you had the watergate investigations that you were a part of you then had your husband who was impeached and now your political opponents is getting impeachment
do you have the impeachment touch is just like a thing
you know um i wasn't part of andrew johnson but you know other other than that ah
it it is at a strange perspective to have um because i was a young lawyer ah investigating richard nixon
and i am very pleased that the house today is proceeding in such a <unk> manner ah they had that vote ah today about the procedures
because that's what happened in <unk> at first the american people looked at the idea that nixon would be impeached after he won a massive <unk> in <unk>
and they thought that that doesn't make any sense but as the evidence came out and we were literally working eighteen hours a day
compiling evidence making you know the legal ah arguments the constitutional arguments
and finally people realize that
yeah obstruction of justice abusive of power contempt of congress are not what we want to turn a blind eye to in our country
we need checks and balances it's one of the reasons why the rule of law is at the core of our democracy
so i know the difference ah about how the house's power is supposed to work
<unk> i was part of seeing it work ah i believe in the right way one of the people we profile is barbara jordan
who if you go to youtube you can see her ah speech when she voted on the articles of impeachment in <unk> with her defense of the constitution
and so i'm hoping that now that this is going to move toward public hearings
where people can see these witnesses in person they can be like a juror themselves trying to decide
ah that ah the american people will you know make a very ah careful study of what they're being told
because the founders put impeachment in the constitution for a reason
ah we have elections but in between elections if there's behavior that is undermining our country endangering our national security
as the allegations here are ah it's an extraordinary remedy but one that has to be exercised in a sober careful way
it's interesting because americas is a place where it feels like this process and procedure will be tested more than ever before because of how partisan america has become
because of how you know toxic politics in america has become
and i i was interested chelsea because i've noticed a lot of people have asked you why you aren't running for an open seat in <unk>
you are a resident of new york state there is a seat that is open and you have the ability to take that seat in many people's opinion
and you've often said no there is other young people who could take that everyone said yes but you would definitely you know take that seat and you would run with that and you've said you are interested in changing people's lives
do you have a <unk> to engage in politics because of how your mom has been treated in her life
no ah because i see her get up every day and still engage
and so for me the decision to not even think about kinda running for
the seat that congresswoman <unk> <unk> will leave ah at the end of next year
is more about an affirmation of what i'm doing now
um and i'm thrilled that there are already so many people who have thrown their hats into the ring
and i hope that young people don't kinda see the toxicity in this moment and turn away from it i hope they see it and say i want to change that
and i want to get back to a place of science and evidence based decisions and respect for democracy and respect for the rule of law
so i hope people take it up <unk> as an opportunity
right
um for what must be different and then be part of the change doing that
you know because it hasn't you know it hasn't always been like that we've had part partisanship from the very beginning
but there's also been a lot of effort to find common ground so back to the nixon impeachment
when the articles of impeachment were voted on members of ah the republican party in the congress voted for one or more of them
so there has been ah many times
we write about ah margaret chase smith a republican woman senator from maine who was the first member of her party to stand up to joseph mccarthy in the early <unk>
so we've had not only people but a consensus around what it is we're trying to protect and cherish
and so i can hope that maybe there will be enough people who make their decision not on you know protecting the president but protecting the country
ah either way they end up
it's interesting because many of the the women you've written about in the book also share one common trait and that is the obstacles they have to overcome
often included being accused of things or being scrutinized in a way that was not similar to the men around them to their male counterparts
how would you respond to a trump supporter if they took the time to listen to you and said
<unk> i don't think it's fair that trump is gonna be impeached for getting information from ukraine
when your team engaged in russian information through ah you know the co the the team that worked on that side on the steele dossier
how do you respond to that person when they say you're engaged in foreign information on a political rival trump did the same what is the difference
there's a huge difference ah you know if you look at the power that the president holds
the president is in a position to use american leverage and credibility to achieve the goals of our nation
so i could imagine no i could imagine a conversation where a president would say to the president of ukraine
you're new at the job one of the things that has held you back is corruption we want to help you fight corruption
but we want evidence that you are really dedicated to fighting corruption if that's all that had been said
there's nothing wrong with that
as secretary of state i used to go and visit leaders and say you know one of your biggest problems is you've got rampant corruption
it's in your family it's in your people around you you've got to deal with it
but that's not what happened and we now have not only the whistle <unk> and the alleged incomplete transcript
we now have a lot of witnesses who are all saying this was about helping the president himself
he is acting as the president he's not a political candidate he is not a private citizen he's the president
now works for the united states
he works for the united states and we don't want to <unk> our credibility
so if other countries see this as they clearly are
that this president really could care less about ukraine could care less whether it becomes a stable country could care less whether it's able to defend itself against russia
all he wants is for them to manufacture some kind of damaging information
about the person he thinks is his likely opponent joe biden
so there's a huge difference i mean people can gather you know information in you know all kinds of different ways
but when you combine it with that quid pro quo that existed ah in that conversation which has now been verified repeatedly
by people who were in the room people who were under pressure
to deprive the ukrainians of military aid so they could defend themselves there's an active war going on in eastern ukraine
the russians and their <unk> are still killing ukrainians and so
what this president is basically done is i don't care i don't care about any that i just need some dirt
and i don't care if you make it up you know in order to get military aid you've got to give me something on joe biden and his son
it really does seem like trump has taken ah ah unconventional ah approach to say the least in international affairs
he has been very explicit in saying it's america first and that's all i care about syria has been an interesting case
and and as a former secretary you have the ability to speak to this with ah depth knowledge
trumps said i pull the troops out because it's time for america to leave these endless wars everyone spoke out against trump for doing this
but it was one of your former ambassadors robert ford who said at one point that the alliance with the kurds was never meant to be permanent
it was just meant to be a temporary coming together because both sides wanted to beat isis and they want allies of all time what do you think is the more correct approach then
look i i don't think his real philosophy is america first i think it's trump first and he judges everything as to how it will help him
and perhaps he impulsively decided that bringing our troops home um was good for him politically
and that seems to be how he is justifying it
but let's assume we had ah a president who ah was interested in achieving that goal in a defensible way
here's what could have happened he could have very well have said to the people who know something about syria the kurds the turks and others
and said you know we need to start a process ah in order to figure out how we can protect the kurds who have been our allies
maybe not for all time
but they sure have been sacrificing um on behalf of our objective to drive the islamic state out of syria
and we know they are holding tens of thousands of prisoners ah for us so let's not leave them ah to their <unk>
let's figure out how we work with the turks who are worried about their border let's see how we work with the kurds let's use the leverage we have
because we still have troops that are special forces who are working ah alongside the kurds and let's figure out how we're gonna make this happen
instead of just waking up and walking to the south lawn of the white house and say we're bringing all our troops home and i've talked to president erdogan
and since we don't know what he says on these calls for all we know it could be hey ah you know ah president erdogan ah we're gonna take that our troops out what you have on joe biden
we don't know
right
and that's what's so frightening about what's happening
because he has an affinity for dictators ah he's clearly <unk> ah the north koreans ah
kim jong-un has been firing missiles and obviously not ah behaving the way that a meeting with the president should have ah led him to
he clearly does putin's bidding i mean putin could not be happier to have the ukrainians caught up in this
while he continues to you know eat away at their country and their sovereignty
the russians have a huge amount of influence now in the middle east
because they are right there in ah syria alongside the iranians and <unk> up the assad government
so there's a lot of moving pieces on this complex <unk>
and i've been in a white house ah situation room where the president was demanding information
not acting on impulse where we were running through different scenarios where we had to be constantly testing our opinions against others
in order to give the president the best advice that is not happening in this white house
it is unfortunately ah unpredictable about what he will do next
so therefore other countries particularly ones adversarial to us
are going around the world saying you can't you can't count on america anymore you know count on us
we will sell you arms not the americans we will make deals with you not the americans we will have investments in your country not the americans
and it's a tragedy
because um i think we were really well positioned at the end of the obama administration to keep building on our leadership
but i think that's been ah <unk> under this president
let me ask you one question before we wrap it up the book of <unk> women talks about women who have done something amazing throughout time
one thing that we can't deny has changed throughout time has been politics and the way we see the world
i've always been fascinated as to your relationship you know you are you are your mother's daughter yes
but you are younger than her are there ever political ideas or you know the conversations you have where you don't agree or you've changed how you see an idea because of your age difference
yes
yes absolutely i think ah most notably on gay marriage and equal marriage rights
ah which is something that we talked about extensively
wow
um throughout years and
i'm really grateful and proud of my mom for her shift to being just a dogged determined not only supporter but advocate for equal marriage rights
so you were like in the house and you were like mom got to get gay rights going come on
like a weird fight to be having with your mom i'm not cause like i was like i wan to go to a party and you were like mom gay people need to get married
go to your room young lady that's pretty wild
i mean yes but hopefully in a nicer tone
but chelsea was you know really one of the strong ah voices on behalf of ah gay marriage here in new york
um she you know gave lots of speeches she was part of a group of leaders that we're advocating for it
and you know i really respect ah and listened to her about all kinds of things
and this was something that ah made a lot of sense to me especially because she has such passion about it
well i'll tell you this it is a book of <unk> women written by two of the <unk> thank you so much for being on the show wonderful having you here
the book of <unk> women is available now secretary hillary <unk> clinton and chelsea clinton everybody
the following <unk> political program is sponsored by t v for gold walter miller on behalf of berry gold walter republican candidate for president of united states
ladies and gentlemen we take pride in presenting a thoughtful address by ronald <unk> mister <unk>
thank you
thank you very much
thank you and good evening the sponsor has been identified but unlike most television programs the performer hasn't been provided with the script
as a matter of fact i have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few weeks
i have spent most of my life as a democrat i recently have seen fit to follow another course
i believe that the issues confronting us cross party lines
now one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election are the maintenance of peace and prosperity the line has been used we have never had it so good
but i have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity isn't something on which we can base our hopes for the future
no nation in history has ever survived the tax burden that reach the third of its national income
today <unk> cents out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax collector share
and yet our government continues to spend seventeen million dollars a day more than the government takes in
we haven't balanced our budget <unk> out of the last <unk> years we've raised our debt limit three times in the last twelve months
and now our national debt is one and a half times bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world
we have fifteen billion dollars in gold in our treasury we don't own an ounce foreign dollar claims are <unk> point three billion dollars
and we've just had announced that the dollar of nineteen <unk> will now purchase forty-five cents in its total value
as for the peace that we would preserve
i wonder who among us would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or son has died in south vietnam and ask them if they think this is a peace
that should be maintained indefinitely do they mean peace or do they mean we just wanted to be left in peace
there can be no real peace while one american is dying some place in the world for the rest of us
we're at war with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long crime from this swamp to the stars
and it's been said if we loose that war it didn't so doing loose this way freedom of ours
history will record with the greatest astonishment of those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent it's happening
well i think it's time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the founding fathers
not too long ago two friends of mine were talking to a cuban refugee a businessman who would escape from castro
and in the midst of his story one of my friends turned the other and said we don't know how lucky we are and the cuban stopped and said how lucky you are
i had some place to escape to and in that sentence told us the entire story
if we lose freedom here there's no place to escape to this is the last stand on earth
and this idea the government is behold into the people that it has no other source of power except to sovereign people
is still the newest and the most unique idea in all along history of man's relation to man
this is the issue of this election
whether we believe in our capacity for <unk> or whether we abandon the american revolution
and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far distant capital can plan our lives for us better then we can plan them ourselves
you and i are told increasingly we have to choose between a left or right well i'd like to suggest there is no such thing is a left or right
there is only an up or down
man's own old age dream the ultimate and individual freedom consistent with law and order or down to the end heap of the terror terrorism
and regardless of their sincerity their humanitarian motives those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this down with course
in this vote harvesting time naive is terms like the great society
or as we were told a few days ago by the president we must accept the greater government activity in the affairs of the people
but they've been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves at all of the things i know will quote of appeared and print
these are not republican accusations
for example they have voices that say the cold war will end through our acceptance of a not <unk> socialism
another voice says the profit motive is become <unk> it must be replace by the incentives of the welfare state
or our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the twentieth century
senator fulbright has said his stand for university that the constitution is <unk>
he referred to the president as our moral teacher and our leader
and he says he is <unk> in his task by the restrictions of powers imposed on him by this antiquated document
he must be freed so that he can do for us what he knows is best
and senator clark of pennsylvania another <unk> spokesman defines liberalism as meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government
well i for one <unk> it wanna representative of the people refers to you and me the free men and women of this country as the masses
this is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in america
but beyond that the full power of centralized government this was the very thing the founding father sought to minimize
they knew that governments don't control things a government can't control the economy without controlling people
and they know when a government sets out to do that it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose
they also knew those founding fathers that outside of its legitimate functions government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy
now we have no better example of this than government's involvement of the farm economy over the last thirty years
since nineteen <unk> the cost of this program is nearly doubled <unk> of farming in america is responsible for <unk> percent of the farm surplus
<unk> of the farming is out on the free market and is known a <unk> percent increase in the per capita consumption of all its produce
you see that <unk> of farming that's regulated and controlled by the federal government
in the last three years we've spent <unk> dollars in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we don't grow
senator humphrey last week charged that barry <unk> as president would seek to eliminate farmers he should do his homework a little better
because he'll find out that we've had a decline of five million in the farm population under these government programs
he'll also find that the democratic administration has sought to get from congress
extension of the farm program to include that <unk> that is now free
you'll find that they've also asked for the right to <unk> farmers who wouldn't keep books as prescribed by the federal government
the secretary of agriculture asked for the right to seize farms through condemnation and <unk> them to other individuals
and contained in that same program was a provision that would have allowed the federal government to remove two million farmers from the soil
at the same time there has been an increase in the department of agriculture employees there's now one for every thirty farms in the united states
and still they can't tell us how <unk> <unk> of grain headed for austria disappeared without a trace and billy <unk> has never left sure
every responsible farmer and farm organization has repeatedly asked the government to free the farm economy
but how who are farmers to know what's best for them
the full wheat farmers voted against wheat program the government passed it anyway now the price of bread goes up the price a week to the farmer goes down
meanwhile back in the city under urban <unk> assault on freedom carries on
private property rights so deluded that <unk> for just almost anything a few government planners decided it should be in a program that takes from the needy and gives to the greedy
we see such spectacles as in cleveland ohio a million and a half dollar building completed only three years ago must be destroyed
to make way for what government officials call a more compatible use of the land
the president tells us he's now going to start building public housing units in the thousands where heretofore we've only built them in the hundreds
but f h a and the veterans administration tell us they have a hundred and twenty thousand housing units they've taken back through mortgage foreclosure
for three decades we've sought to solve the problems of unemployment through government planning and the more the plans fail the more the planners plan
the latest is the area redevelopment agency
they've just declared rice county kansas a depressed area
rice county kansas has two hundred oil wells and the fourteen thousand people there have over thirty million dollars on deposit in personal savings in their banks
when the government tells you you're depressed lie down and be depressed
we have so many people who can't see a fat man standing beside a thin man without coming to the conclusion the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one
so they're going to solve all the problems of human misery through government and government planning
well now we have government planning and welfare have the answer
and they'd had almost thirty years of it shouldn't we expect government to read the score to us once in a while
shouldn't they be telling us about the decline each year in the number of people needing help
the reduction in the need for public housing but the reverse is true which year the need grows greater the program grows greater
we were told four years ago that seventeen million people went to bed hungry each night well that was probably true they were all on a diet
but now we're told that nine point three million families in this country are poverty stricken on the basis of earning less than three thousands dollars a year
welfare spending ten times greater than it was in the dark depths of the depression
we're spending forty-five billion dollars on welfare
now do a little arithmetic and you'll find that if we divided the forty-five billion dollars up equally among those nine million poor families
we'd be able to give each family <unk> hundred dollars a year and this added to their present income should eliminate poverty
direct aid to the poor however is only running about six hundred dollars per family it would seem that some place there must be some overhead
now
so now we declare war on poverty or you too can be a bobby baker
how do they honestly expect us to believe that if we add one billion dollars to the forty-five billion we're spending one more program to the thirty odd we have
and remember this new program doesn't replace any it just duplicates existing programs do they believe that poverty is suddenly going to disappear by magic
well in all fairness i should explain there is one part of the new program that isn't <unk> this is the youth feature we're now going to solve the <unk> problem juvenile <unk>
by <unk> something like the old c c c camps and we're going to put our young people in these camps
but again we do some arithmetic and we find that we're going to spend each year just on room and board for each young person we help <unk> hundred dollars a year
we can send them to harvard for <unk> hundred
of course don't get me wrong i'm not suggesting harvard as the answer to juvenile <unk>
but seriously what are we doing to those we seek to help
not too long ago a judge called me here in los angeles
he told me that a young woman who come before him for a divorce
she had six children was pregnant with her seven under his questioning she revealed her husband was a <unk> earning two hundred and fifty dollars a month
she wanted the divorce to get an <unk> raise she's eligible for three hundred and thirty dollars a month in the aid to dependent children program
she got the idea from two women in her neighborhood who'd already done that very thing
yet anytime you and i question the schemes of the <unk> were denounced as being against their humanitarian goals they say we're always against things we're never for anything
well the trouble with our liberal friends is not that they're ignorant it's just that they know so much that isn't so now
we're for a provision the <unk> should not follow unemployment by reason of old age and to that end we have accepted social security as a step toward meeting the problem
but we're against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception regarding its fiscal shortcomings
when they charge that any criticism of the program means that we want to end payments to those people who depend on them for a livelihood
they've called it insurance to us in a hundred million pieces of literature but then they appeared before the supreme court and they testified it was a welfare program
they only use the term insurance to sell it to the people and they said social security dues are a tax for the general use of the government
and the government has used that tax there is no fund because robert byers the <unk> head appeared before a congressional committee
and admitted that social security as of this moment is two hundred and <unk> billion dollars in the whole
but he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they have the power to tax they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble
and they're doing just that a young man <unk> years of age working at an average salary
his social security contribution would in the open market buy him an insurance policy that would guarantee two hundred and twenty dollars a month
at age <unk> the government promises a one hundred and <unk> he could live it up until he's <unk> and then take out a policy that would pay more than social security
now are we so lacking in business sense that we can't put this program on a sound basis
so that people who do require those payments will find they can get them when they're do that the cupboard isn't bare barry <unk> thinks we can
at the same time can't we introduce voluntary features that would permit a citizen who can do better on his own
to be excused upon presentation of evidence that he had made provision for the <unk> years
should we not allow a widow with children to work and not lose the benefits supposedly paid for by her deceased husband
shouldn't you and i be allowed to declare who our beneficiaries will be under this program which we cannot do
i think we're for telling our senior citizens that no one in this country should be denied medical care because of a lack of funds
but i think we're against forcing all citizens regardless of need into a compulsory government program
especially when we have such examples as was announced last week when france admitted that their medicare program is now bankrupt they've come to the end of the road
in addition was barry <unk> so irresponsible when he suggested that our government give up its program of deliberate planned inflation
so that when you do get your social security pension a dollar will buy a <unk> worth and not forty-five cents worth
i think we're for an international organization where the nations of the world can seek peace
but i think we're against <unk> american interest to an organization that has become so structurally <unk>
that today you can master a two-thirds vote and the floor of the general assembly among nations that represent less than ten percent of the world's population
i think we're against the hypocrisy of <unk> our allies because here and there they cling to a colony
while we engage in a conspiracy of silence and never open our mouths about the millions of people enslaved in the soviet colonies in the satellite nations
i think we're for <unk> our allies by sharing of our material blessings with those nations which share in our fundamental beliefs
but we're against <unk> out money government to government creating bureaucracy if not socialism all over the world
we set out to help nineteen countries we're helping a hundred and seven we've spent a hundred and <unk> billion dollars
with that money we've bought a two million dollar yacht for <unk> <unk> we bought dressed suits for greek <unk> extra wives for kenya government officials
we bought a thousand t v sets for a place where they have no electricity
in the last six years <unk> nations have bought seven billion dollars worth of our gold and all <unk> are receiving foreign aid from this country
no government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size so government programs once launched never disappeared
actually a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever seen on this earth
federal employees federal employees number two and a half million and federal state and local one out of six of the nation's workforce employed by government
these <unk> <unk> with their thousands of regulations have cost as many of our constitutional <unk>
how many of us realized that today federal agents can invade a man's property without a warrant they can impose a fine without a formal hearing let alone a trial by jury
and they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine
in <unk> county arkansas james <unk> over planted his rice <unk> the government obtained a <unk> judgment
and a u s marshal sold his nine hundred and sixty acre farm at auction the government said it was necessary as a warning to others to make the system work
last february nineteenth at the university of minnesota norman thomas six times candidate for president and the socialist party ticket said if barry <unk> became president
he would stop the advance of socialism in the united states i think that's exactly what he will do
but as a former democrat i can tell you norman thomas isn't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration
because back in nineteen thirty-six mister democrat himself al smith a great american came before the american people
and charged that the leadership of his party was taking the party of jefferson jackson and cleveland down the road under the banners of marx lenin and stalin
and he walked away from his party and he never returned to the day he died
because to this day the leadership of that party has been taking that party that honorable party down the road and the image of the labor socialist party of england
now it doesn't require <unk> or <unk> of private property or business to impose socialism on our people
what does it mean whether you hold the deed to the or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death
over that business or property and such machinery already exists
the government can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute every businessman has his own tale of harassment
somewhere a <unk> has taken place our natural <unk> rights are now considered to be a <unk> of government
and freedom has never been so fragile so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment
our democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues they wanna make you and i believe that this is a contest between two men
that we're to choose just between two personalities well what of this man that they would destroy
and in destroying they would destroy that which he represents the ideas that you and i hold dear
is he the <unk> and shallow and <unk> man they say he is
well i've been privileged to know him when i knew him long before he ever dreamed of trying for high office
and i can tell you personally i've never known a man in my life i believed so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable
this is a man who in his own business before he headed politics instituted a profit sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it
he put in health and medical insurance for all his employees he took fifty percent of the profits before taxes
and set up a retirement program a pension plan for all his employees
he sent monthly checks for life to an employee was ill and couldn't work he provides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores
when mexico was ravaged by the floods in the rio grande he climbed in his airplane and flew flew med medicine and supplies down there
an ex g i told me how he met him
it was the week before christmas during the korean war and he was at the los angeles airport trying to get a ride home to arizona for christmas
and he said that a lot of servicemen there and no seats available on the planes
and then a voice came over the <unk> and said any men in uniform wanting a ride to arizona go to runway such and such
and they went down there there was a fella named barry <unk> sitting in his plane
everyday in those weeks before christmas all day long he load up the plane fly it to arizona fly them to their homes fly back over to get another load
during the hectic <unk> timing of a campaign this is a man who took time out to sit beside an old friend who was dying of cancer
his campaign managers were understandably impatient but he said there aren't many left to care what happens to her i'd like her to know i care
this is a man who said to his <unk> son there is no foundation like the rock of honesty and fairness
and when you begin to build your life on that rock with the cement of the faith in god that you have then you have a real start
this is not a man who could carelessly send other people's sons to war
and that is the issue of this campaign that makes all the other problems i've discussed academic unless we realize we're in a war that must be won
those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution of peace without victory they call their policy accommodation
and they say if we'll only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy he'll forget his evil ways and learn to love us
all who oppose them are indicted as war <unk> they say we offer simple answers to complex problems
but perhaps there is a simple answer not an easy answer but simple if you and i have the courage to tell our elected officials
that we want our national policy based on what we know in our hearts is morally right we cannot be by our security our freedom from the threat of the bomb
by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now <unk> behind the iron curtain give up your dreams of freedom
because to save our own skins we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters
alexander hamilton said a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
now let's set the record straight there's no argument over the choice between peace and war
but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace and you can have it in the next second surrender
admittedly there's a risk in any course we follow other than this but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in <unk>
and this is the <unk> our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face that their policy of accommodation is <unk>
and it gives no choice between peace and war only between fight or surrender
if we continue to accommodate continue to back and retreat eventually we have to face the final demand the ultimatum and what then
when the key to <unk> has told his people he knows what our answer will be
he has told them that we're retreating under the pressure of the cold war and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum
our surrender will be voluntary because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually morally and economically
he believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for peace at any price or better red than dead
or as one commentator put it he'd rather live on his knees than die in his feet and there in lies the road to war because those voices don't speak for the rest of us
you and i note and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery
if nothing in life is worth dying for when did this begin just in the face of this enemy or should moses have told the children of israel to live in slavery under the <unk>
should christ have refused the cross should the patriots at concord bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard round the world
the martyrs of history were not fools and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the nazis didn't die in vain
where then is the road to peace well it's a simple answer after all
you and i have the courage to say to our enemies there is a price we will not pay there is a point beyond which they must not advance
and this
this is the meaning in the phrase of barry <unk> peace through strength
winston churchill said the destiny of men is not measured by material <unk> when great forces around the move in the world we learn we're spirits not animals
and he said there's something going on in time and space and beyond time and space which whether we like it or not spells duty

this program is brought to you by stanford university please visit us at stanford dot e d u
it now gives me great pleasure to introduce this year's commandment speaker steve jobs
the chief executive officer and co-founder of apple and <unk> animation studios
stanford university has been characterized since it's founding by willingness to be bold and to strike out new directions
and this is a characteristic very much shared by today's speaker a pioneer and visionary
for almost three decades his name and the companies he has founded have been synonymous with innovation and creativity
as a young boy growing up in los santos steve jobs came of age at the same time as silicon valley
while still in school he attended lectures informally at stanford as well as at julie <unk> where he spent the summer working
after graduating from high school he left california to attend <unk>
attract through india and assured strength as a video game designer for atari followed
soon after his return to the valley in nineteen <unk>
he became a regular along with steve <unk> at meetings of the <unk> computer club
held at the stanford linear accelerator centre it was not long before the two of them had build the prototype for the apple one
the apple one was very fast at the time reading and writing four kilobytes in about twenty seconds
about twenty thousand times slower than we do so today
the apple two was faster still but more importantly introduced color monitors into the home market
in the mid nineteen eighties the <unk> became the first truly user friendly personal computer
you didn't have to be an expert to set it up or to load software
or to transfer information between applications and the mouse offered point and click convenience
and opened the door to computer literacy for everyone
i still remember the amazed faces of <unk>
as they saw a computer that was completely different from the personal computers of that day
steve also co-founded <unk> animation studios which has <unk> the film industry in it short history with brilliant use of technology
and produced two academy award winning films toy story and finding nemo
since his return to apple eight years ago steve has <unk> the company once again extending it's vision to music and new digital media
<unk> and <unk> have changed the way we listen to organize store and purchase our music
and in my case the way i often read books
now songs we love are just <unk> cents and a completely legal click away
<unk> and <unk> <unk> the ability of consumers to organize edit and display digital photography and video
putting capabilities that once cost thousands of dollars into the hands of every mac user
steve is also widely recognize for his ability to create an innovative environment inside apple as well as as an external company image that is equally innovative
just think about apple's marketing campaigns over the past three decades a promotional flyer in nineteen <unk>
showed <unk> newton sitting under a tree just as an apple was falling by
with the catchy <unk> to bite b y t e into an apple
there was an iconic super bowl commercial
<unk> humor
an iconic super bowl commercial telling us that the <unk> was on the horizon
and assuring us that we would see why nineteen <unk> wouldn't be like nineteen <unk>
and in the late nineteen nineties we saw banners and billboards
featuring pablo <unk> albert einstein martha graham and <unk> gandhi all urging us to think different
steve jobs understands the creativity and innovation start by thinking differently
he has a deep routed belief in the power of education to transform lives coupled with desire to make the world a better place
from the earliest days of apple he worked to develop partnerships with educators and get computers into schools
for almost three decades he and his companies have provided invaluable technology in supports to schools and communities
increasing accessibility to information for learners of all ages
more than one hundred years ago in describing his vision for a new university <unk> stanford wrote
the imagination needs to be cultivated and developed to assure success in life
stanford clearly understood the technical knowledge was only the starting point for creation and discovery
steve jobs understands that the computer is a very powerful tool in a technical sense
but that it's true power lies in the ability to unleash the imagination and creativity of the user
as he explained to the new york times in a nineteen <unk> interview the <unk> turned out so well
because the people working on it were musicians artists poets and historians
who also happened to be excellent computer scientists
and last fall a business week reporter asked how he manages for innovation
his answer was <unk> simple we hire people who want to make the best things in the world
steve jobs <unk> the spirit and creativity that have characterized this university since it's founding one hundred and fourteen years ago
and we're pleased to have him here today please join me in warmly welcoming this year's commandment speaker steve jobs
i'm ah honored to be with you today for your commandment for one of the finest universities in the world
truth be told
ah i never graduate from college and ah this is the closest i've ever gotten to a college graduation
today i wanna tell you three stories from my life that's it no big deal just three stories
the first story is about connecting the docs
i dropped out of re college after the first six months but then stayed around as a drop in for other eighteen months or so before i really quit
so why'd i drop out
it started before i was born
my biological mother was a young <unk> graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption
she felt very strongly that i should be adopted by college graduates so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife
except than when i popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl
so my parents who were on a waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking we've got an unexpected baby boy you want him
they said of course
my biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduate from college and my father had never graduate from high school
she refused to sign the final adoption papers
she only relented a few months later when my parents promised that i would go to college this was the start in my life
and seventeen years later i did go to college but i naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as stanford
and all of my working class parents savings were being spent on my college tuition after six months i couldn't see the value in it
i had no idea what i wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out
and here i was spending all the money my parents had save their entire life
so i decided to drop out and trust that it would all workout okay it was pretty scary at the time but looking back it was one of the best decisions i ever made
the minute i dropped out i could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting
it wasn't all romantic i didn't have a dorm room so slept on the floor in friend's rooms i returned cope bottles for five cent deposits to buy food with
and i would walk the seven miles across town every sunday night to get one good meal a week at the <unk> krishna temple
i loved it and much of what i stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on let me give you one example
reed college at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country
throughout the campus every poster every label and every drawer was beautifully hand <unk> because i had dropped out
and didn't have to take the normal classes i decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this i learned about <unk> and <unk> <unk>
about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations about what makes great typography great
it was beautiful historical <unk> subtle in a way that science can't capture and i found it fascinating
none of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life
but ten years later when we were designing the first <unk> computer it all came back to me and we designed it all into the mac
it was the first computer with beautiful typography if i had never dropped in on that single course in college
the mac would have never had multiple <unk> or <unk> <unk> fonts and since windows just copied the mac it's likely that no personal computer would have them
if i had never dropped out i would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do
of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when i was in college but it was very very clear looking backwards ten years later
again you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future
you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma whatever because believing that the dots will connect
down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the <unk> path and that will make all the difference
my second story is about love and loss
i was lucky i found what i loved to do early in life <unk> and i started apple in my parent's garage when i was twenty we worked hard
and in ten years apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a two billion dollar company with over four thousand employees
we just released our finest creation the <unk> a year earlier and i just turned thirty
and then i got fired
how can you get fired from a company you started
well as apple grew we hired someone who i thought was very talented to run the company with me and for the first year or so things went well
but then our visions of the future began to <unk> and eventually we had a falling out when we did our board of directors sided with him and so at thirty i was out
and very publicly out what had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating
i really didn't know what to do for a few months i felt that i had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down that i had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me
i met with david <unk> and bob <unk> and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly
i was a very public failure and i even thought about running away from the valley but something slowly began to dawn on me i still loved what i did
the turn of events at apple had not changed that one bit i've been rejected but i was still in love
and so i decided to start over
i didn't see it then but it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me
the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again less sure about everything it freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life
during the next five years i started a company named next another company named <unk> and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife
<unk> went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film toy story and is now the most successful animation studio in the world
in a remarkable turn of events apple bought next and i returned to apple and the technology we developed at next is at the heart of apple's current renaissance
and <unk> and i have a wonderful family together
i'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if i hadn't been fired from apple it was awful tasting medicine but i guess the patient needed it
sometime life sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick don't lose faith
i'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that i loved what i did you've got to find what you love and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers
your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work
and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you haven't found it yet keep looking
and don't settle as with all matters of the heart you'll know when you find it and like any great relationship it just gets better and better
as the years roll on so keep looking don't settle
my third story is about death
when i was seventeen i read a quote that went something like if you live each day as if it was your last someday you'll most certainly be right
it made an impression on me and since then for the past <unk> years i've looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself
if today were the last day of my life what i want to do what i am about to do today and whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row
i know i need to change something
remembering that i'll be dead soon is the most important tool i've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost everything
all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important
remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose you are already naked
there is no reason not to follow your heart
about a year ago i was diagnosed with cancer
i had a scan at <unk> in the morning and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas i didn't even know what a pancreas was
the doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable and that i should expect to live no longer than three to six months
my doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order which is doctors code for prepare to die
it means to try and tell your kids everything
you thought you'd have the next ten years to tell them in just a few months it means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that will be as easy as possible for your family
it means to say your <unk>
i live with that diagnosis all day later that evening i had a biopsy where they stuck an <unk> down my throat through my stomach and into my intestines
put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor i was <unk> but my wife who was there told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope
the doctor started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is <unk> with surgery
i had the surgery and thankfully i'm fine now
this was the closest i've been to facing death and i hope it's the closest i get for a few more decades having lived through it
i can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept
no one wants to die even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there
and yet death is the destination we all share no one has ever escaped it and that is as it should be
because death is very likely the single best invention of life its life's change agent it clears out the old to make way for the new
right now the new is you
but some day not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away
sorry to be so dramatic but it's quite true
your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life don't be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people's thinking
don't let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition
they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary
when i was young there was an amazing publication called the whole earth catalog which was one of the bible's of my generation
it was created by a fellow named stuart brand not far from here in <unk> park and he brought it to life with his poetic touch
this was in the late sixties before personal computers and desktop publishing so with all made with typewriters scissors and <unk> cameras
it was sort of like google and <unk> form thirty-five years before google came along it was idealistic overflowing with neat tools and great notions
stuart and his team put out several issues of the whole earth catalog and then when it had run its course they put out a final issue
it was the mid <unk> and i was your age
on the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road
the kind you might find yourself hitch hiking on if you were so adventurous beneath it were the words stay hungry stay foolish
it was their farewell message as they signed off stay hungry stay foolish and i have always wished that for myself
and now as you graduate to begin a new i wish that for you stay hungry stay foolish thank you all very much

is the biden administration starting from scratch with the vaccine distribution effort or are you picking up where the trump administration left off
no i mean um we certainly not starting from scratch because there is activity going on in the distribution with taking what's going on but amplifying it in a big way

the vaccine supply in america should have increased every single week
and we found that we hit a wall quickly
at least a dozen states are now reporting vaccine supply shortages some rolling back <unk> requirements
this hospital in florida is now <unk> first doses starting sunday governors are begging for federal health
our biggest problem is really simple it's lack of vaccine
it's a reversal from just a few weeks ago when many state didn't have the space or the people to administer all the shots
now it's a supply issue
it's really ah a day by day conversation of trying to say how do we get more how can we get more um we we'd love to have more

a <unk> factor in all this those new strains of the virus especially a dangerous variant from south africa that is elevating concern tonight richard <unk> has more
in london covid deaths have risen to nearly twice last year's peak largely because of that new more contagious strain of the virus
the c d c estimates could be dominant in the u s in march
it's not the only strain a south african variant may have evolved to infect people more than once
this virus can spread a bit more efficiently from person to person
doctor richard <unk> discovered the south african variant
we worry that this variant maybe able to escape the some of the natural immunity that's elicited by infection with the virus
that mean is it possible that this variant is able to <unk> people
what about the vaccine the vaccines we have now can they stop the south african variant
so we don't know yet and that's that's really one of those critical questions that we are now addressing
well that data is still coming in a new study yet to be peer reviewed reports the south african variant ability to evade antibodies
may make current vaccines less effective lester
richard <unk> tonight thanks since so many pinning their hopes on the vaccines the toll remained staggering more than four thousand one hundred americans died from covid yesterday that's a new record
here's miguel <unk>
as the u s marks the darkest day of the pandemic <unk> staggering death toll means one american died every twenty one seconds
just as troubling the accelerated rate in which the country surpassed four hundred thousand deaths
states like alabama arizona and pennsylvania have the highest death rates in the nation
these patients are scared
brittany <unk> has watched the virus destroy families for months
it's just it's heartbreaking to see these patients go through what they're dealing with
while hospitals and hot spots remain overrun there is measurable progress even in l a county the numbers are encouraging though still worrisome
covid nineteen is still rampant at our workplaces in our neighborhoods so the end is not yet in sight
according to a new study while americans know wearing a mask gives them protection only about half say they always comply when coming into close contact with others
experts insist as americans defy precautions the death toll will rise

now he is worried about a divided america
you want to work with president biden i don't like when a lot of people put trump's supporters are all in that basket of domestic terrors because we're not i don't believe i am you know i love this country
in wisconsin trump voter <unk> allen told us she too is giving president biden a chance
i support the republican party and that's the way that i vote however whoever's sitting in that seat that's who i pray for
do you find yourself hopeful or pessimistic when you stand ahead at at the rest of twenty <unk>
i'm always hopeful we've overcome some things over the many centuries that have passed and and this time is no different than any other we will overcome we'll we certainly will overcome
what about the looming impeachment trial of former president trump we asked indiana democrat cynthia <unk>
our democracy is fragile right now and we must do whatever it takes to protect it and that means holding folks accountable
but nevada republican <unk> <unk> told us it only deepens the divide
i really don't feel that there's grounds for it let biden go ahead and and go forward ah <unk> not going to accomplish anything

peter alexander n b c news inside the oval office throughout
great tour why are so many doses of potentially <unk> covid treatment going unused that's next
back now with what n b c news has learned about drugs that could keep covid patients out of the hospital thousands of doses going unused
now officials are pleading with doctors to get them to patients in need here's kristen <unk>
as the americans scramble to find doses of a dwindling vaccine supply and hospitals overflow
shelves are piling up with <unk> antibodies a potentially <unk> drug used by former president trump during his bout with covid
i do think it's a failure that we didn't make it more known to the the lay public this was an option for them
the drug mimics the body's immune response and has been authorized for high-risk patients showing mild to moderate symptoms
it decreases the chance of developing severe illness and lowers the risk of hospitalization but it's given as an infusion in a clinical setting
difficult at the time when space and staffing is in short supply
to date michigan has received twenty thousand doses but is administered just ten percent
it's awareness really across the spectrum from ah frontline clinicians primary care physicians ah emergency physicians ah infectious disease docs just knowing that it's a tool in the toolbox
jerry <unk> got <unk> antibodies when she tested positive for covid last month her symptoms never got worse
i was back to running probably the next day
the infusion works best when the viral load is highest which is why the f d a requires it to be given within ten days of a positive test
experts say patients should advocate for themselves and ask their primary care doctors if it's right for them
a potentially <unk> treatment in abundant supply just waiting to be used kristin <unk> nbc news
one lucky ticket scored the winning <unk> numbers last night purchased at this store in northwest maryland and worth seven hundred and <unk> million dollars
if it wasn't you there is still mega millions tomorrow now at an astounding nine hundred seventy million dollars
up next my conversation with the poet inspiring america
we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free
surrounded by presidents and music <unk> one voice at yesterday's inauguration stood apart from the others
a twenty <unk> whose take on our country was pure poetry
somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken but simply <unk>
her poem is called the hill we climb amanda <unk> the first youth poet laureate <unk> the nation and capturing our story
being american is more than a pride we inherit it's the past we step into
and her story too
you had a passage in there you said we the successors of a
country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president
only to find herself reciting for one that kind of opened up the door of who you are
i'm amanda <unk> twenty-two years old and getting here took a village
ah it took me getting over a speech <unk> it took me having a strong single mother who raised me
and i'm black and i'm female and i'm proud of it
she was asked to read at the inauguration by first lady doctor jill biden who had heard the young harvard grad read before
we wanted the theme of this poem to reflect the larger theme of the inauguration which was america united
but as she was writing the capital was suddenly attacked
there was this moment of just horror and you know disgust but then i also felt an enormous responsibility to say okay this is occurring
what am i going to do about it
one of my favorite passages let the globe if nothing else say this is true
but even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that we'll forever be tied together victorious
not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division
was that written after or before the sixth
that was written during that day i had this understanding that the world is watching us that we have the eyes of history and the future upon us
your twitter followers have blown up are are there any tweets that stand out in your mind
the ones i've definitely saved are the photos of children watching the inauguration and then seeing me on screen children of all colors and backgrounds and that just really makes my heart explode
to know that the next generation is witnessing that moment and getting to see themselves represented as being the change makers and being the wave that is going to redefine our country

oh i wish i was here at the beach ah what a gorgeous shot as we take a look at this santa monica pier it is almost friday folks
and i've got nice weather on tap for you for friday even the first half of your weekend should not be too bad
alright let's take a look at our current condition we had highs today ah right around <unk> degrees our temperature should be into the upper sixties
so once again we got to enjoy a day today with <unk> above average so very nice out there and it will be even warmer tomorrow
many areas will be closed to eighty degrees by tomorrow
looking at our current temperatures <unk> in van <unk> it's <unk> in pasadena <unk> downtown <unk> in the i e low sixties at the beaches
but the beaches although that will be the place to be tomorrow well let me just warn you the ocean waters will be very dangerous
we've got high surf <unk> in effect surf anywhere between about five to eight feet but by tomorrow especially in <unk> especially along those west facing beaches we could get surf up to around fourteen feet
so again do be careful we had sunny skies all day and then we saw some partly cloudy skies this afternoon into the evening hours but just again making for a beautiful day
warm night warm days but at night we've got those clear sky so it will be chilly again tonight so keep that in mind
ah the offshore flow keeping us nice and mild but i'd say we'd have warm in some areas by tomorrow afternoon all thanks to high pressure which unfortunately is getting nudged out just in time for the weekend
so saturday will be that day of transition when we will start to see more clouds move in
it will be cooler highs will be back into the sixties and then the storm system swings through on sunday bringing us some rain
and i'm talking about about a half inch of rain in many areas ah so do keep that in mind and then lowering snow levels by early monday morning
and then by monday it is just going to be cold and windy out there especially considering our highs tomorrow will be seventy at the beaches seventy-five in the alien o c metro areas
<unk> in land and in the valleys and again <unk> dropped five to ten degrees by saturday as upfront approaches
and then sunday will be the day be indoors do something indoors our temperatures will be into low sixties but we will have light to moderate showers throughout the entire day on and off
monday will be cool and breezy and then temperatures will be mild under sunny skies by next week alright now is the time for the <unk>
this <unk> is brought to you by <unk> tourism the greatest snow owners
ah we've got some good skiing out there in <unk> definitely because it is ah the weekend to be there in sunday and it's <unk> inch <unk> all forty-five trails are open
park city <unk> inch <unk> ah <unk> and thirty of the <unk> <unk> trials are open so that's pretty good
up here in mountain here at home has an eighteen inch <unk> eighteen of the <unk> trials open mammoth
fantastic after this latest storm storm moves through hundred and twenty-five inch snow bass and all one hundred and <unk> trials are open

yeah you gotta you gotta put those on oscar oh boy
shame him he he's naked and it's okay
you're right alex congratulations on that let me see what they did here yeah around this of his music
there was lady gaga they were i was wondering if they would write stephanie on there or lady gaga do you get to choose what they put on there
no
oh oh so they just decided to go with that
like you get one and this is what it is yeah yeah and i'm just happy that there's the name on it at all
and yeah that it's your name too so
thank you
what have you been doing since like what has happened since sunday night
you know it's just been incredible i swear when we won it was like my whole artistic journey flashed before my eyes
and i instantly saw myself sitting on my stoop of my studio apartment in new york city on the concrete with my keyboard next to me
trying to figure out how i was going to lug my keyboard again up my <unk> and you know it's just it's incredible you know
this was hard work
yeah sure
and as you know i said it in my speech and i'll say it again if you work hard and you don't give up you can do anything and it's
i can tell you i know you put a lot of work into everything you do and that performance that you and bradley gave that was really one of the great performances in the history of the oscars
thank you
it was like i mean ah among ah you know we were watching it at home we were like oh my what's going on between these two
and did you feel like did people well i know it caused this big controversy because it was such an <unk> you had such a connection with bradley that instantly
and i guess this is a compliment people started saying oh you they must be dating they must be in love
okay first of all like like social media quite frankly is the toilet of the internet
yes it is
it's just like i i and what it has done to pop culture is just abysmal and and and yes people saw love and guess what that
so we wanted you to see
yes
no i mean this is ah this is a love song shallow ah this the movie a star is born it's a love story we worked so hard
we worked all week on that performance bradley who ah you know i like never relinquish control about a live stage performance and i've done a million of them
which you know he directed this film and he directed all of you know obviously the musical moments in the film
and he directed obviously shallow the moment in the film so i knew that he had the vision for how it should go
and so i was like you know what do you what do you think bradley and he gave me he laid it all out everything that you saw the way that it was shot
the way they pushed the piano out you saw them you know ah ah put the piano together and and ah ah
no intro
walk up on stage no intro all of that that was all him and he even also ah was the one that was like i think the audience should be lit so that we're not just lit the audience is lit
so then i called roy bennett who i work with and he does my lightning and i am like we need to light the ah entire room with amber lights because bradley wants <unk> and we got to give him what he wants
and you know and you know it was just great and and from a performance perspective it was so important to both of us that we were connected the entire time i mean
look i've i've had my arms wrapped around tony bennett for three years touring the world i mean
that when you're singing love songs that's what you want people to feel
are you having an affair with tony bennett be honest
no no i'm an artist and i guess we did a good job and fooled ya
oh yeah yeah you did a very good job
bradley bradley did a great job i've known him for a long time and the idea of i mean it's one thing to go on stage and sing on the oscars that's terrifying just to start
but then to sing with you and and to you know be trading lines with you in a movie you can pick and choose but you're on live television was he terrified
no
no
because we practiced and we worked hard you know bradley's a musician i mean
my favorite thing about the whole experience was i was just so excited for people not only at home but you know our peers in the room to see him sing live
to see that he can sing live
sang every take in this movie live every single time i mean all of it
there's no lip <unk> and i was i was so excited and you know i was in the moment but you know when we started and he start singing tell me something girl
the whole audience start cheering and i was like yes bradley like yes they love it keep going we've got this you know it was great
so if you were acting you could have that same connection with me if we were singing that song
yeah
tell me something girl how you lonely in this great big world
the words
that's not the something like that though right
yeah it's close that's close
yeah i guess not yeah i know bradley it's hard you know what i fall in love with him when i look at him it's really hard not to look in those eyes and just get lost
you know i don't feel like i won i feel like we won
i'm gonna go get a <unk> and write his name on that picture
that is lady gaga and bradley cooper in a star is born
which that is that was not in the version of the movie and i saw it
that is additional you've added some footage to this new version

what were you getting from your parents at that time do you remember
like twenty bucks which is like it's considerable

you know so it's like that that that twenty dollars was my friday night so like it wasn't usable so i slowly got a job and i was a hostess
and my my mom and dad used to go to the bar and they'd be with their friends who were writers and artists and you know sometimes you know no one would be coming in the restaurant and i would be standing there just cause nothing to do
and i would just go i'd like to thank the academy for this tremendous honor i've wanted to be an actress my whole life
and then so i would like in you know practice my acceptance speech and everyone at the bar would howl with laughter like

ah
so ah but this is a story about how you'd do anything ah for your ah kids and ah like he's in the fourth grade

so
anyway they're study in easter island anybody here from easter island and ah where are my easter island people
so
so we go out there and we see the big heads and then then then that's the first day
and then the second day we go to the other side of the island and see some more big heads
ah and then they they show us a head that's not real and you got to compare wow

hi i'm andy ellen asked me to remind you to subscribe to her channel so you can see more awesome videos like videos of me getting scared or saying embarrassing things like ball <unk> hammer
and also some videos of ellen and other celebrities if you're into that sort of thing
so what happened to dave <unk> he is here today to talk about it in his first television interview please welcome dave <unk>
fine fine fine i am glad you here everybody wants to why'd you walk away from fifty million dollars
well i wasn't walking away from the money
yeah
i was walking away from the circumstances
that that were coming with the new found plateau
yeah
it takes a while when you punch through ah to adjust the atmosphere
it was completely outside of my frame of reference i've been in show business since i was fourteen and ah i've heard the stories
of what happens and i've seen these kinds of things play out in front of me
okay when you say you heard the stories what do you mean what stories
i mean you see before look mariah carey made hundred a million dollar deal and three months later she's all of a sudden mysteriously crazy
or martin lawrence punches through and he's waving a gun on the street screaming they're trying to kill me
yeah
yeah yeah yeah we hear those stories
and it always happens around the time when the career would have it seems as though they're crossing over the next plateau
yeah yeah would you say you lost your mind sort of
no
no
not exactly
okay
ah i wasn't crazy but it is incredibly stressful
yeah
and ah i felt like in a in a lot of instances i was deliberately being put through stress because ah you know when you're a guy that generates money
yeah
people have a vested interest in controlling you
yeah were they trying to control you because you know i read the time magazine article and they were quoted as saying you had extreme creative control
and that you really ran your own show
yeah ok but oprah i did two very successful seasons before that so why all of a sudden on the third time am i at africa by myself like what's happening
yeah so what happened did you find yourself spiraling
downward
first of all yeah but
i don't wanna make it as a thing where i'm <unk> myself of any responsibility
yeah
obviously um i'm partially responsible you know a lot of it has to do with me
was there a tipping point for you
i'll give you an example the first season ends
yeah
ah and in the middle of the seasons there was a <unk>
okay
ultimately through a series of events an an an and a little pressure ah i ended up ah settling for for way less than what i wanted ah
and going forward and then in season two
the d v d is released and it sets all these incredible records turns out the back
a million in one day
right
one two point two million in a week the <unk> television d v d of all time
yeah yeah so now suddenly suddenly this is a bigger <unk> than they thought it was already making money but now all of a sudden it's a whole new revenue stream
and my contract stuff ah
yeah
yeah
you know so ah we finish the season so now you know the show is
gaining popularity ratings are up every week it's it's i'm the toast of the town
yeah
and ah
when the season starts ending you know you get the question so ah dave ah what are you gonna do and blah blah blah and i knew to be real <unk> about it
you know what like comedy central was a hot place to be when i showed up there
yeah
but you turned it around your show turned it around became the most popular
that's what i was thinking
yeah
yeah yeah
you know so ah an an and then there is there is this thing we're having argue all these arguments dave you got cut the poop joke and there was a lot of discussions about we know what our audience wants
i was like ah whatever and and i mean they were wrong a hundred percent of the time
ah huh
as far as as far as what people will like
ok
and the show is an incredibly hard show to do that's the other thing
<unk> show was ah
i mean it's fun and all these things but it it there's a tremendous amount of work that goes into to making a show like that
yeah people were saying though that you were on drugs you lost your mind you went into a mental institution what is true what is not
not on drugs
not on drugs
nah not for years
ah okay
no i'm not on drugs
and you weren't on drugs at the time
no no not at all not at all i'm telling you i was incredibly stressed out
ah you know love is like a nutrient
and i was deficient on vitamin love
really
were you really
now really what was going on
man where do you start
damn the story
i ah
i was doing sketches
that were funny
but socially irresponsible
i felt like i was deliberately being encouraged and i was overwhelmed so
it's like you're getting flooded with things and you don't pay attention to things like your ethics
yeah
or when you get so overwhelmed it's like you had won the lottery
explain
let's say for your handlers for instance
yeah
a lot of these people ah traditionally get paid on percentage <unk> the more you work
the more they make
the more they make
yeah
you make that real money
they lost their minds i thought they were crazy
ah huh
you know it was like you got to do everything
yeah yeah
so i got all these things then i got you know your own personal problems that get inflamed when this kind of money comes in
and i got to write a show and do the show and i was overwhelmed
and it was almost like
i don't know it was almost as if this was happening deliberately
ok you mentioned a moment ago that you felt that there were some things that weren't socially responsible like what
like there's this one sketch that we did that was about the this <unk> that would appear whenever racist things happens whenever someone make you feel like
they calling you that n-word
ah huh
but don't say it and it was it was funny and ah the premise of the sketch was that every race had this like <unk> this like racial complex
and
but the but the <unk> was in <unk> now
<unk> is a very difficult image but the reason i had chosen <unk> at the time was because this was gonna to be the visual <unk> of the n word
it was it the it was a it was a good spirit or intention behind it
but what i didn't consider is how many people watch the show
and how the way people use television is subjective
i completely understand
yeah
i call finish because i have a story to tell you
so then when i'm on the set and we're finally taping the sketch
somebody on the set that was white laughed in such a way i know the difference of people laughing with me and people laughing at me
and it was the first time i'd ever gotten a laugh that i was uncomfortable with
not just uncomfortable but like should i fire this person
ah
and at the same time i'm just not a naturally assertive person
what was it about the laugh
i know all these people be watching t v
that there is a lot of people who will understand exactly what i'm doing
then there's another group of people who are just fans like the the people that the kind of people that scream i'm rick james be at my concerts
yeah
they're just along for a different kind of celebrity worship ride they're gonna get something
completely different
completely different
yeah
that's concerning
yeah
i didn't wanna i got to i mean i don't want black people to be disappointed in me for putting that out there
no you you didn't want to be disappointed in yourself
you know what oprah
you're right
yeah i still haven't gotten to why you just disappeared so you had that moment the guys are laughing too much was that the tipping point for you was that the straw
that was the first tipping point
okay
and then they put in the paper that i had ah pneumonia or god knows what
<unk> <unk>
it was walking pneumonia cause i was walking all over the place
ah i was relaxing
ah and then after that i was coming back to the show
and ah then they were like well dave you know you should just back up the pneumonia story and i um was like that was your thing um not i'm not backing up a pneumonia story
and then then the next day it was in the paper that i had writer's block then i knew something was getting ready to get stressful because i hadn't even started writing <unk> it wasn't i was on schedule to write so i was like what's
you know what's going on are they gonna
so these are your people trying to feed
manipulate it sounds like somebody's trying to put young dave in a compromising position
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but you know okay so now it got worse and when i said i'm not gonna do it then all of a sudden it was like well now he has walking pneumonia and then i knew long before i walked i had considered walking
you had considered
i had considered walking because i went back to work and the vitamin love was gone because it was a real ugly negotiation
it's a situation where now everybody's taking credit for this and that and the other it's all it's just it was getting ridiculous and i knew i was gonna leave so i got ahead of schedule and i bounced
and i didn't tell anybody where i was going
the whole time they're trying to convince me i'm insane
they were trying to get me to take psychotic medication
yeah
like i'm sitting around you know i was stressed out but the people that were telling me i was insane i believe that they knew what was going on
so ah this was troublesome
yeah
i'm not taking this medicine man because i know how these people be trying to control you or or maybe discredit you i was afraid like you know
but you were stressed out that's why
there's no question but it's very stressful for someone to constantly walk behind you and say you're insane
oh hey how about this i show up to work first week and they where my office used to be they built a wall there
why
i didn't know why
but it came out later that they were like well they said you wanted it i don't want to be walled up at the office
i like hanging out and talking
ok so you got up and you walked out and nobody knew where you were going did your family know
nah well no i called my brother
yeah
me and my brother real cool i called him up and was like i'm going to africa he was like cool man that's good
did your wife and children know where you were going
no
no nobody knew
no i bounced
now that sounds a little crazy
it's not crazy because the situation kind of warranted it
okay
ah because certain people around me were putting my sanity in question i would meet too much obstruction if i would say i'm doing something like this
yeah okay
so i figured it wasn't that i didn't tell my wife it was like i'm not telling her till after i'm gone which was a mistake
but it wasn't a crazy mistake it's just a <unk>
yeah
yeah
as a husband she should have known where you were gone is that what you're saying
she was gonna know you know i basically i called my brother i told and i gave him a list you call <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and i took off
then i called my wife
okay why were you going to africa specifically
one i needed a break
needed a break
two we have family friends down there and three i just felt like ah it was a place where i could really
reflect it's just a place that i got to go
and what did you conclude about yourself
oh well that i wasn't paying attention i felt really guilty about being asleep at the wheel
i felt guilty about it because i
i forgot the the <unk> hostility of the environment of show business
it's ah you know it's not a ah <unk> environment it's a challenging environment
yes
you know and there's some quote that someone had told me it says success takes you where character cannot sustain you
wow that's a good quote
yeah okay i don't care who you think you are or how you think you do it you cannot imagine
what celebrities go through
as far as how your integrity and your self image and all these things
ok this is a theory that i've always had and i've discussed this with other people the idea that if you don't know who you are when this big thing hits when the big stuff comes
if you don't know who you are and can't stand in the center of yourself then you end up confused and feeling thwarted and feeling diffused in many directions
because everybody is pulling on you would you say that that was a part of your issue trying to figure find the center for yourself
absolutely
when you are suddenly given a fifty million dollar contract when you've been making i don't know what before that is a lot to to orchestrate to handle and a lot for other people to figure out
in that sense it was like all right you're the c e o of a fifty million dollar company good luck
yeah yeah now you figure it out
right
but you've worked your whole life for it you wanted it
you know struggled to get it sacrificed sacrificed rejected many times told that things wouldn't work wouldn't work wouldn't work and then all of a sudden you're the genius
and we're gonna give you fifty million dollars and that was too much for you to handle
no that's the thing that i always read that makes me mad no it was the fame couldn't stand the fame
yeah
i love being famous
yeah
it's phenomenal when i came out here and everybody was like hooray i was like ah back on tv
ok so that's clear it's not the fame it's what
it's the way that people around you position themselves around you to get in your pockets and in your mind
yeah yeah yeah
that it is <unk> to me
you know one of one of the phrases i always loved is to whom much is given much is expected and part of it is
i know i'm like spider-man peter with great power comes great responsibility
no no no but it doses but it does it does and part of that is not just being up on stage
it's handling the rest of the business and handling all the people that are lined up at your door for whatever reason
yeah yeah you are absolutely right
don't get the fifty million with no no strings attached
yeah but at a certain point it was like all right this is enough
yeah
colleagues were quoted as saying that you had become ah increasingly paranoid would you say you were paranoid
sure first of all what is a black man without his paranoia intact
and if you get if you get
you might win a hundred dollars in a poker game and be on the subway you gonna look over your shoulder
they just said in everything i had fifty million dollars that's like that's like making me a marked man
so did you go to a psychiatric hospital
in south africa
yeah
who
oh yeah that's right i i was so
i'm only asking
no i'm just i got to get people thinking all right who goes from america to africa for medical attention
so true
i i cannot imagine
yeah yeah
this is sound like the most irresponsible journalism in the world i cannot imagine
yeah
being a journalist and hearing this
yeah
from from these people
and just running with it was on everything
yeah
as a fact
yeah hi youtubers i am excited to give you an update about our own youtube channel now you can find new videos everyday there are the kind of videos that will make you look at life differently they may even make you laugh a little bit
subscribe to the own channel today and will see you on youtube
a little over three minutes plus additional time remaining
as so often <unk> hopes rest on <unk> <unk> shoulders
ronaldo
it's a warm indeed very humid night here in <unk> there is a very tangible sense of anticipation
it's <unk> first game at the <unk> fifa world cup russia <unk> ronaldo is appearing at his fourth world cup
the third in which he'll captain his country
yeah so portugal went into the <unk> world cup as european champions they won euro <unk> beat france the host in the final
i think there were a lot of expectations about portugal going into the world cup that perhaps they could finally go farther than just the group stage and the round of sixteen
<unk> faces the nation he has just spent the last nine years <unk> his trade in spain
i think that definitely motivated ronaldo himself you know a lot of those players would have been his teammates of course at real madrid
he really wanted to leave everything on the field and that's exactly what we saw
<unk> is that a penalty it is
it doesn't take long for <unk> seven to make his mark
inside the opening three minutes <unk> ronaldo foul in the penalty area
<unk> now has the chance to score for his country from the penalty spot he's been here before
<unk> year old <unk> ronaldo
waits for <unk> <unk> whistle <unk> himself
and scores
he had been at the euros two years prior and they made it to the finals losing out to greece
he was already arguably <unk> most potent attacking weapon and that was a really good portugal team
they early note his team that ronaldo found himself part of the a phenomenal team in terms of talent
one reason why ronaldo did well at that tournament he wasn't <unk> sole focus point
you know you had seymour <unk> who was doing very well of course you had luis <unk> you had <unk>
the netherlands game in the last sixteen was actually a brutal experience for ronaldo
the netherlands tried to take him out of the game take him out of the equation and that's what they did an absolutely horrendous tackle
that was a very scandalous game where you had sixteen yellow cards you had four red cards i mean that was a really difficult game for both teams ah for <unk> that was a learning moment
as he got older and he got fitter and more muscular if you like stronger and that's probably a game he would have been able to ride more
it was more what happened in that game against england that took all the headlines
there is ah this fault of rooney against ricardo <unk>
and rooney and all the english team said that <unk> go to the <unk> to say give him red card
and there he is walking over to the bench he gives a nice little wink and of course everybody in england understandably was very upset
i mean it definitely i think was an early sign of what was to come over the next few years in terms of christian ronaldo and his personality
the england game actually ended perfectly for ronaldo despite all his controversy as he took the winning penalty in the <unk>
it's all over for england portugal going to the last four
they overcame him on penalties and then lost to a french team as inspired by <unk> <unk> who's absolutely exceptional in that game
and it's his world cup at the moment <unk> <unk>
portugal tried to get back into it ah quite close on a few occasions
he goes for gold but it can't hold it oh what a chance missed
but just wasn't to be
<unk> ronaldo against david de <unk>
it's one <unk> portugal and was there ever any doubt it just had to be him
<unk> lead only lasts twenty minutes
pepe gets the header and goes down play continues it's diego costa can he get the shot away costa scores
well <unk> mentality isn't it i think that's what makes him the player he is
just before half time <unk> has slipped the ball on the edge of the box
ronaldo with the shot oh it's gone in an error from david de <unk> and <unk> ronaldo gets <unk> second goal of the night
portugal are back in front tonight <unk> is on a mission against spain perhaps motivated by revenge for what happened in the past
ronaldo <unk> was a very very different ronaldo to ronaldo two thousand and six
between those two world cups he signed for real madrid he becomes the most expensive player to sign for the club and in the world at that point in time for a <unk> million euros
and at that point he had become the leader and the captain of portugal
with a room in which the turn for ronaldo made room for the shot oh off the post what a strike
he had a different manager to play under first he had different teammates arguably the best player in the world after winning champions league with manchester united the attention is drawn to him much more than before
here's ronaldo no free kick
carlos k raj the coach had come in unfortunately for portugal it all went horribly wrong the relationship between ronaldo and k raj was very strained
and i think that was really stemmed from the tactics employed by k raj
his whole tactic seemed to be let's just make our team as difficult to score against as possible and our attacking system would just be whack the ball up to ronaldo and let him work some magic on his own
and it just didn't work at all
great opportunity here for brazil to come see
ronaldo scores once ah during that tournament albeit was an excellent goal ah against north korea where he's sort of juggling actually he balanced the ball on the back of his neck and sort of rolled it over the top of his head and then scored
and then it was the derby ah the <unk> derby
and they got knocked out to spain who at least for them a bit of comfort is knowing that they went on to win the whole tournament altogether
and they were a fabulous spanish side nobody really could take them apart nobody could really beat them at all
it's true that spain have a beautiful team at this time
i think there was a lot of pressure on <unk> ronaldo to be this big figure since he was this worldwide superstar but unfortunately he came up against
this spanish wall that he just wasn't able to break through
after the game ronaldo was asked what went wrong and i think he told the germans to ask carlos <unk> in quite a pointed fashion
i think it's one world cup which you can't really blame him at all for his lack of production it was definitely just the team wasn't set up to get the best out of him at all
the world cup disappointing in the finish disappointing and not not scoring the goals that people expected him to score but it was the foundation for him as a player to to improve on and build
ronaldo with the shot oh it's gone in
eight years later and portugal are now the ones with the upper hand they lead <unk> with forty-five minutes left on the clock
<unk> ronaldo has turned this group match back in <unk> favor
with spain applying more pressure there's not too much <unk> can do except hope his defense will hold firm
silva with a little chip back across goal turned in diego costa strikes again
a simple <unk> move from spain and for the second time tonight in <unk> spain have <unk>
but then there's not much the defense can do when the ball falls to <unk>
now it might drop for the shot here oh what a shot that is <unk> the man who gave away the penalty early on in this match
has redeemed himself in style
thanks to a wonder strike spain have turned the game around they now lead <unk> and it looks like history is set to repeat itself
it seems <unk> can't shake his bad luck at the world cup
germany lead the height of <unk> the goal of <unk> germany get another one and they do terrible terrible defending germany have got four
what a dreadful day and an awful start for portugal
so in the way that ronaldo had progressed quite a lot between two thousand six and two thousand ten he progressed equally a far distance between two thousand and ten and two thousand fourteen he went to that tournament the champions league winner with real madrid <unk> <unk> winner
it was not a great tournament ah he have a lot of problem a physical problem but he wants to stay he wants to be there
so he decided to play through the pain and to play through the injury
because he felt that without him they weren't going to be able to advance but it didn't matter in the end because it just didn't it didn't work out
germany were phenomenal in <unk> actually went on to win the tournament but nevertheless to get beat four <unk> it was <unk> heaviest defeat at a world cup it was pretty humiliating
portugal were really ronaldo <unk> at this time
against the united states that defense they they really put a clamp down and it was very difficult for him
with the ball in bradley chance for u s a and it's a goal
it was quite amazing actually that ronaldo managed to to pull out of the bag a chance to keep their world cup alive just by the <unk> of threads virtually the last kick of the game
unless we have a most dramatic twist in the final seconds now into the last thirty oh and we have it's a dream of a cross from ronaldo
and <unk> <unk> it
he was gonna play until the last whistle of every game that's his mentality that is what he drives for he's not gonna rest
and i think he figures you know even if i have you know my leg <unk> i'm going to go out there and i'm going to still try and score or at least set somebody else up to score
because he's just that focused and that determined
and the last game against ghana all sorts of <unk> portugal was still in of a shelter qualifying that basically they needed to win and win big
ronaldo managed to score the goal but it was already quite near towards the end of the game
maybe now ronaldo yes he has goal number fifty of his international career
it was too little too late at that point and the damage was done and they weren't able to get out of the group and they crashed out very early on in the world cup
in a very disappointing world cup for portugal he was probably <unk> best player
it was probably at that moment maybe that's the gap between <unk> best player ronaldo and the rest of the team was most exposed
it's definitely a world cup where portugal paid the price for just not being fit enough
ronaldo goes down gets a free kick challenge is by <unk> now this is a key moment we know who's going to strike it
the game approaches its final minutes <unk> stands over a free kick displaying his trademark stance
this for his hat trick and to save portugal from defeat
ronaldo
oh genius absolute genius would you believe it
it was a phenomenal goal everybody at that point just kind of fell out of this season and said okay it's not <unk> day we just need to accept that this is all about <unk> ronaldo
you don't see those individual performances in the world cup that often
it actually sums up ronaldo a brilliant goal scored in a huge game at a critical moment
exemplary perfection and it's a hat trick for <unk> ronaldo
in their next game against morocco <unk> fine form continues as he scores the decisive goal in a promising performance
he is a sensation
he would be his <unk> goal in the international ah scene he would pass <unk> <unk>
and so he then became the highest goal <unk> in europe in international football and the second overall in the world
against i r iran a <unk> wonder goal puts portugal ahead
was <unk> world cup luck turning at last
this will give portugal breathing space
ronaldo is denied
and the game and the group are still very much alive
<unk> missed penalty ultimately costs portugal the top spot in their group
which means they'll face <unk> in the round of sixteen a formidable opponent
round of sixteen they run into <unk> which is a tough <unk> because their defense is geared it's very physical really caused ah problems for <unk> ronaldo
<unk> was able to deal with the considerable threat not his finest hour from a <unk> suarez over on that far side and it's pinpoint
oh dangerous cross <unk> it's them again
unfortunately for portugal they really only got going in the second half when they were really backs against the wall
adrian silva shot the deflection for a corner
pepe has done it
well there's the answer they were looking for
but they really didn't do themselves justice and i think <unk> were deserved winners at the end two brilliant goals you have to say
hernandez four on three for a moment here <unk> brilliant that is pure gold
for the fourth time in his career <unk> ronaldo is knocked out of the world cup
it's all over and maybe it is the end in terms of world cups for the great <unk> ronaldo
in that world cup he showed one last time if it is the last time that he is such a prolific goal <unk> that is legendary
i think <unk> in a way sums up <unk> international career which is exceptionally talented a play for the big occasion but just part of a team that bar france in twenty sixteen has never been good enough to to win one of the major honors
we don't know if that will be his last world cup i don't think it will be i think there's a very good chance that we could see him at <unk> twenty twenty-two he'll be <unk> years old
by the time that world cup rolls around
ronaldo will not be <unk> sole attacking threat so you could argue that the stage was perfectly set for him to really thrive in this world cup
as part of an exciting attacking team as the the elder statesman and perhaps put those former world cups where he didn't perhaps do himself justice you know put that to rights
the moment in his life all force and all well applaud for the netherlands
saved by romero
and who have argentina sent up first of course lionel <unk>
the man for all moments
for many on planet football the number one the man
the two thousand forty fifa world cup brazil was perhaps the most important tournament in lionel <unk> career
so in <unk> there was still a lot of expectation for this player who had been breaking all sorts of goal scoring records at club level
but never truly excelled at international levels
<unk> made sure that their first match against bosnia and <unk> went to plan
that was captain <unk> it's a devilish delivery team the <unk> have all control
<unk> can do it its lionel <unk> he score
in a win for argentina where they look solid and set up the tournament really for the expectation that they could go a long way
however the next game against <unk> iran wasn't quite so straightforward
argentina the top team in south american qualifying against iran
it was a tough game for argentina because around defending really well argentina didn't have that many chances during the game
this is not <unk> day so far
a win would send argentina through to the next round and with seconds left no one knew that better than their captain
he could go for goal and oh my goodness gracious me if one man could win a football match it would be lionel <unk>
messy produced maybe his most spectacular individual moments at a world cup
classic <unk> we've seen him do it time and time again
<unk> an unbelievably talented player leading his country to victory
the prophecy that had been made about a <unk> many years ago was now being fulfilled
it was really at youth world championships with argentina when he burst into public consciousness
he was the absolute star of that tournament he actually didn't start the tournament in the team
you know it was very evident the kind of player he was the way that he was at times head and shoulders above everyone else in the game
lets start and let do it again although he's pulling his goal lionel <unk>
<unk> against brazil he scored from outside the box early on a thunderous shot into the top corner
check probably starts by one of the players of the tournament lionel <unk>
and that took them into the final and again <unk> was the hero in the final he scored both goals in a <unk> win over nigeria and they were champions
that's his penalty and he scores
being the star player he was named player of the tournament he was the leading <unk>
<unk> trophy and it's a fifth world crown
that tournament that few weeks in the netherlands when the world knew we've got a special player on our house
i think within argentina it was quite a clamor for him to be in the squad for for two thousand and six there was a lot of interest when he came off the bench against serbia in in ah the group game
and lionel <unk> becomes the youngest <unk> player to play at a world cup since nineteen <unk>
it's <unk> he just had to score
that was going to be the perfect start ah to the world cup
the hero of argentina the player they've <unk> for to be included has scored a six
it doesn't have a happy ending in two thousand and six and it could have done because they played germany in the court finals the game goes to penalties and lionel <unk> is left on the bench
again because of circumstances beyond his control he was left watching from the sidelines in the decisive moment in his team's season
lionel <unk> career could have been very very different how did he play against germany
though already qualified topping the group would mean an easier route to the final and a better chance at lifting the world cup
it was nigeria they needed to beat and with his sights set on lifting that coveted trophy so began the messy show
the third group game was on the back of <unk> he scored the opening goal very early on
on the first one absolutely hammers it into the roof and there's no stopping it
who was gonna get this first <unk> was
nigeria weren't an easy team to play against had a lot of attacking talent his second goal against nigeria is a stunning free kick
extraordinary just everything you want from a free kick
the argentina came away with the three two win um on the back of two <unk> goals
he was heading into the <unk> stages having argentina one three out of three looking like a team that could go all the way
against switzerland la <unk> once again struggled to find a way through against a tough opponent
game seven of the round of sixteen
opposition <unk> intent on on trying to stop <unk> he was a man in form and a man intent on taking argentina all the way switzerland tough opponents not much in the game
and looked like it was going to go to penalties
this time <unk> would leave it right up until the one hundred and eighteenth minute before making the difference
argentina one hell argentina
just before the dreaded penalty shoots out argentina had found their way into the last eight
and argentina now surely are safely through the <unk>
against the belgium it would be quite the opposite <unk> <unk> on a mistake for first few minutes
they started off superbly with the goal
argentina were able to show that they had this collective structure which they've been lacking in the past that it wasn't just a <unk> team an d that if they got ahead
they could defend for the rest of the game and just close out a game to win it one night which is exactly what they did
is it clear goal argentina score in the last eight minutes of the game
<unk> men held firm to win the match he had now done what no <unk> captain had managed in the past twenty-four years
he had led his country to the <unk> <unk> was finally in the last four
although it hadn't been easy there had been much pain along the way
by the time the next world cup rolled around in two thousand ten in south africa he was the best player in the world
it was an incredible story would <unk> be able to leave <unk> to the title look back at the highlights from nearly every game <unk> involved in almost everything but he doesn't score
and ultimately it wasn't able to make much of a difference against germany
the team system was completely different it never looked convincing
again germany just as happens in two thousand and six with a team to put in a sort but this time in a far more convincing way
from your opinion the sweat saves was no way that anything was gonna happen other when when the germany pictured
they're queuing up again here it's going to be put on a plate
he said i think he ends up taking a lot of the blame for <unk> disastrous performance
deeply frustrating for <unk> because he came away from that tournament knowing that he hadn't played particularly well but also knowing that he didn't really have the chance to because the way the team was structured just didn't allow it
what will be regarded as a day of disaster for argentina argentina <unk> germany four
argentina the last south american standing in brazil which of these will meet it at the american
the <unk> neither argentina nor the netherlands have managed to score after one hundred twenty minutes
the team that makes the world cup final will now be decided on penalties
who fancies it who fancies it boys it is the dutch first
and it is big one what a moment in his life all force all will against netherlands
saved by romero
the netherlands was again a very tough tight game
this is when keepers come alive
and who have argentina sent up first of course lionel <unk> the man for all moments
for many on planet football the number one the man
<unk> for sure
captain leads by example scoring his penalty
there is no occasion too big
absorbing <unk> confidence argentina then proceed to score their next two spot kicks
<unk> <unk> oh what a save what a save
it all comes down to <unk> rodriguez a player from <unk> hometown
with this highly charged moment it's in an argentina
a real bound
argentina are set on capturing the big one on brazilian soil
now only one team stood between argentina and the trophy and it was a familiar foe
you don't need more motivation when you're in a world cup final we're not going to let them beat us again
you had the feeling that this is their year this is <unk> opportunity
<unk> argentina would face germany once again
germany and argentina perhaps planet <unk> greatest <unk> rivalry
there are three key moments i remember really in that final from <unk> point of view one was when a mistake by germany sent <unk> clean through on goal
that moment was so crucial to his career yet ironically he wasn't directly involved in it
the first half saw chances on both sides
lionel <unk>
and early in the second <unk> had his chance
received a throughput in one of his favorite positions
he didn't miss it by much but he did miss it and that will be a moment that will haunt <unk> for the rest of his life
one hundred and fifteen minutes gone and these sides still couldn't be separated it was a stalemate until
germany by this stage had got the goal to go ahead
taken with touch with <unk>
game wasn't over
the final moment really of the match the final significant moment <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
it was a long way out he was here in a world cup final with a chance to save his team
this is messy this is the moment
lionel <unk> no no no no no no it's gone away it's got away
the moment was too much for him
and germany go on and win the game and and <unk> on the losing side
i think that messy free kick in two thousand and fourteen is a moment where a lot of argentina fans will feel that could have been their chance
<unk> world cup dream history his dream of his lifetime was over
now germany are the champions of the world
it was so devastating when they lost in that final because it was an opportunity for us to watch the greatest player of a generation go on and win the world cup
it really started to change the many of people's ideas in argentina about <unk> for the national team
this is really
in two thousand and eighteen there was so much um expectation on <unk> can he take them to the final and win it this time
two thousand and eighteen for me was the realization that <unk> can't do it alone <unk> needs more quality around them
there was one outstanding moment for <unk> in the tournament his goal against nigeria he made a run off the shoulders of the defender
<unk> and floated and taken into his stride by lionel <unk> to make it one <unk>
to control the ball on his thigh then take a touch of his left foot then finish with his right without breaking stride
it's <unk> but in the end it wasn't enough because argentina just weren't good enough they they never looked like being good enough
right at the end of the game against france they fought back <unk> flicked over the ball for <unk> to head home
and argentina have another one hang on a minute <unk> <unk>
and they had a last attack and that was the final challenge
argentina very very nearly for the whistle has gone
at the end of the day in two thousand nineteen we just saw lionel <unk> and he's cutting a despondent figure and i think it was a moment when you realize that he can't do it alone
but <unk> is out of the world cup in argentina around france have won it
he's won everything la <unk> <unk> del <unk> champions league world club cup but he's not won the world cup
he wants to win the world cup because he's a winner because he's a champion because he's won everything else but not to prove anything
and he knows that that will define his legacy it's there's going to be another shot you'd imagine in twenty twenty-two but if it was to end today
you would look back and say it's disappointing because he's arguably the best player of all the time
and the one thing you want in the trophy cabinet of the best player of all time is a world cup
he will have one last chance
and can they do that with <unk> age thirty-five
would be just an incredible story after so many misses in different fashions if it's the last thing he does in football he will want to win the world cup
game seven is tied with three and a half to go here on the fourth
green back to thompson
thompson spins shoots over irving can't get up the ball and kevin lowe his <unk> bound
again i think cleveland would be better served to get into whatever they're getting into quicker
now we're gonna see j r smith probably set the spring to get curry in the action
hurry up picks him up by the shoe james towers drives on it lay it lay it missed it they get out a contestant
dream on green kicks it out like a dollar for three
<unk> james and he's <unk> by curry
that's gonna be four <unk> on curry thirteen foul
and we'll take a time out as we get under the three minute mark
what you wanna win this has gotta be the mindset this is good defense and good offence that's both the ways championship effort and on the other end
clearly the contact back curry forcing james go down we have ourselves a ball game a champion soon to come
<unk> remaining fourth quarter of game seven
the only triple doubles in the history of the game seven of the finals were from jerry west and james worthy until tonight as lebron james with <unk> ten and eleven
bring aside the power move to the basket by <unk> dollar right there that's clearly contact dollar got away with it
and also the top call of the me
meanwhile <unk> green one of the shy of a triple double will join james irving will bring it up
james holding throws it in the lab guarded by barnes while the little jump hook short <unk> green fourteen <unk> for <unk> green to go with thirty-two points
curry finds a <unk> drives kicks it our barnes barnes after green puts up a three
alright cats get it back with two eleven remaining
that's great rotation by the cleveland <unk> james closes to the opposite corner love pulls the trigger onto green
terrific defense and very good offence by the way
they good offence on the <unk> partner last possession with love taking a top shot but about curry and lebron the offence is running through me right now
irving drives hot step inside pulls it up misses <unk> taken by <unk>
<unk> to curry back to <unk> up to the left oh blocked by james lebron james with rejection
wow
his third block of the game as we come up on a minute and a half remaining
but again get into your stuff quicker
four to shoot
james inside little jump hook that's short <unk> taken taken by curry
curry drives on irving pulls back for three
doesn't even hit the rim as irving comes the other way
and <unk> <unk> wants a time out
takes one of his final two <unk> left with <unk> remaining and a tie game
oh my goodness
great pass by curry running hard by <unk>
and super human defensive recovery by lebron james
there you see the numbers the triple double from lebron james and curry missing shots we've seen him hit all season long
in what has been an <unk> game seven here at oracle arena
and mike <unk> <unk> to take out tristan thompson insert richard jefferson <unk> that will give him more space but if it's not a timeout <unk>
that's a real challenge for the <unk> against the likes of curry and thompson
each team has a foul to give as we come up on a minute remaining and they're putting curry into pink an role to try and get him on irving
irving and curry one on one irving puts it up let's go curry irving from downtown and the <unk> by three
and i'd like the no time out call by steve curb
love picks up curry curry steps back fakes a three drives again shot up nicely found a green seven to shoot
carry takes the three sets back call all so ah award puts up a three
<unk> james with thirty seconds remaining
what a spectacular job by love
irving on the drive goes inside lost it gets your back in pines love there's a seven second difference between shock clock and game clock
and they had a foul to give so barnes <unk> in there
but that's a bad foul mike that gives them three extra seconds and what was <unk> irving doing in transition
well james will inbound now there's a four point seven difference between shot clock and game clock
<unk> have one timeout left can go in the back court in the last two minutes to get it
but they've gotta a manage this clock they don't wanna go early
irving drives to james misses the jam but foul
warriors have two <unk> remaining
stays a three point game
then mike as a player there's no pressure right now you're up three worst case scenario you gotta give a one free throw that should be the mindset i missed it you gotta step up and knock this free throw down if you're lebron james
warriors will no doubt call timeout miss remake here from james
<unk> in the second four point game timeout called in state
curry runs off
<unk> looking thompson catches thompson to couple of troubles head straight tied up throws it into green and a foul and an entry pass that's the foul to give
and now they'll take it out of bounds with six point five remaining
and you gotta make sure you in nobody's area to allow them to knock down a three and you get contact
i lost the a play off game on a final four point play to jeff van <unk>
<unk> to inbound
<unk> trying to stay with curry catches one trouble steps back puts up a three one goal <unk> taken by states final second
it's over it's over cleveland is the city of champions once again the <unk> are n b a champions
<unk> long sports nightmare has ended the drought is over
<unk> years
time to celebrate a title
and the emotions for lebron james who delivers on his promise to come home and bring a championship to his beloved hometown
let's go to doris
mike overcome with emotion is exactly how i would describe <unk> reaction as he shares a hug with <unk>
we'll give him a minute but he is still crying tears of joy lebron
i'm sorry doris
no no worries <unk> lebron as soon as that <unk> sounded your emotions let loose can you describe what's your feeling right now
i set out a goal two years when i came back to bring a championship to this city
i gave her everything that i had i put my heart my blood my sweat my tears to this game and
against all odds against all odds i don't know why we wanna take the hardest role i don't know why the man above give me the hardest role but it's nothing but the man above
don't put you in situations that you can't handle and i just kept that same positive attitude like instead of saying why me i was saying this is what he want me to do and ah cool evening
this is for you oh
lebron you did what no other team had been able to do coming back from a three to one double shoot in the finals and to do that you had to win twice in a place that proved too much for so many teams
what did you find in game five here
ah just like that i had to change my approach a little bit or how i approached the game i wasn't that good in the first two games here in this building i watched a lot of film detailed it out

how the economic machine works in thirty minutes
the economy works like a simple machine but many people don't understand it or they don't agree on how it works
and this has led to a lot of needless economic suffering
i feel a deep sense of responsibility to share my simple but practical economic template
though it's unconventional
it has helped me to anticipate and to <unk> the global financial crisis and it is worked well for me for over thirty years
let's begin though the economy might seem complex it works in a simple mechanical way
it's made up of a few simple parts and a lot of simple transactions that are repeated over and over again a <unk> times
these transactions are above all else driven by human nature and they create three main forces to drive the economy
number one productivity growth number two the short term death cycle and number three the long term death cycle
we'll look at these three forces and how laying them on top of each other creates a good template for tracking economic movements and figuring out what's happening now
let's start with the simplest part of the economy transactions
an economy is simply the sum of the transactions that make it up and a transaction is a very simple thing
you make transactions all the time every time you buy something you create a transaction
each transaction consists of a buyer exchanging money or credit with a seller for goods services or financial assets
credit spends just like money so adding together the money spent and the amount of credit spent you could know the total spending
the total amount of spending drives the economy
if you divide the amounts spent by the quantity sold you get the price and that's it that's a transaction
it's the building block of the economic machine
all cycles and all forces in an economy are driven by transactions so if we can understand transactions we can understand the whole economy
a market consists of all the buyers and all the sellers making transactions for the same thing
for example there is a wheat market a car market the stock market and markets for millions of things
an economy consists of all of the transactions in all of it's markets
if you add up the total spending and the total quantity sold in the all of the markets you have everything you need to know to understand the economy
it's just that simple
people businesses banks and governments all engage in transactions the way i just described
exchanging money and credit for goods services and financial assets
the biggest buyer and seller is the government which consist of two important parts
a central government that collects taxes and spends money and a central bank which is different from other buyers and sellers
because it controls the amount of money and credit in the economy
it does this by influencing interest rate and printing new money
for these reasons as we'll see the central bank is an important player in the flow of credit
i want you to pay attention to credit
credit is the most important part of the economy and probably the least understood
it's the most important part because it's the biggest and most volatile part
just like buyers and sellers go to the market to make transactions so do lenders and borrowers
lenders usually want to make their money in to more money and borrowers usually want to to buy something they can't afford
like a house or a car or they want to invest in something like starting a business
credit can help both lenders and borrowers get what they want
borrowers promise to repay the amount they borrow called principle plus an additional amount called interest
when interest rates are high there is less borrowing because it's expensive
when interest rates are low borrowing increases because it's cheaper
when borrowers promise to repay and lenders believe them credit is created
any two people can agree to create credit out of thin air
that seems simple enough but credit is tricky because it has different names
as soon as credit is created it immediately turns in to debt
debt is both an asset to the lender and a liability to the <unk>
in the future when the <unk> <unk> the loan plus interest the asset and the liability disappear and the transaction is settled
so why is credit so important
because when a <unk> receives credit he is able to increase his spending and remember spending drives the economy
this is because one person's spending is another person's income
think about it
every dollar you spend someone else earns and every dollar you earn someone else has spent
so when you spend more someone else earns more
when someone's income rises it makes lenders more willing to lend him money because now he's more worthy of credit
a <unk> <unk> has two things the ability to repay and collateral
having a lot of income in relation to his debt gives him the ability to repay
in the event that he can't repay he has valuable assets to use as collateral that can be sold this makes lenders feel comfortable lending him money
so increased income allows increased borrowing which allows increased spending
and since one person's spending is another person's income this leads to more increased borrowing and so on
this <unk> pattern leads to economic growth and is why we have cycles
in a transaction you have to give something in order to get something and how much you get depends on how much you produce
overtime we learn and that accumulated knowledge raises our living standards we call this productivity growth
those who are inventive and hard-working raise their productivity and their living standards faster than those who are complacent and lazy
but that isn't necessarily true over the short run
productivity matters most in the long run but credit matters most in the short run
this is because productivity growth doesn't <unk> much so it's not a big driver of economic swings
that is because it allows us to consume more than we produce when we acquire it and it forces us to consume less than we produce when we have to pay it back
dead swings occur in two big cycles one takes about five to eight years and the other takes about seventy-five to a hundred years
while most people feel the swings they typically don't see them as cycles because they see them too up close day by day week by week
in this chapter we're going to step back and look at these three big forces and how they interact to make up our experiences
as mentioned swings around the line are not due to how much innovation or hard work there is they are primarily due to how much credit there is
let's for a second imagine an economy without credit in this economy the only way i can increase my spending is to increase my income
which requires me to be more productive and do more work increased productivity is the only way for growth
since my spending is another person's income the economy grows every time i or anyone else is more productive
if we follow the transactions and play this out we see a progression like the productivity growth line but because we borrow we have cycles
this isn't due to any laws or the regulations it's due to human nature and the way that credit works
think of borrowing as simply a way of pulling spending forward in order to buy something you can't afford you need to spend more than you make
to do this you essentially need to borrow from your future self in doing so you create a time in the future that you need to spend less than you make
in order to pay it back it very quickly resembles a cycle basically anytime you borrow you create a cycle
this is as true for an individual as it is for the economy
this is why understanding credit is so important because it set into motion a mechanical predictable series of events that will happen in the future
this makes credit different from money money is what you settle transactions with
when you buy a beer from a bartender with cash the transaction is settled immediately
but when you buy a beer with credit it's like starting a bar tab you're saying you promise to pay in the future
together you and the bartender create an asset and a liability you just created credit out of thin air
it's not until you pay the bar tab later that the asset and the liability disappear the debt goes away and the transaction is settled
the reality is that most of what people call money is actually credit
the total amount of credit in the united states is about fifty trillion dollars and the total amount of money is only about three trillion dollars
remember in an economy without credit the only way to increase your spending is to produce more
but in an economy with credit you can also increase your spending by borrowing
as a result an economy with credit has more spending and allows incomes to rise faster than productivity over the short run but not over the long run
now don't get me wrong credit isn't necessarily something bad that just causes cycles
it's bad when it finances <unk> that can't be paid back
however it's good when it efficiently <unk> resources and produces income so you can pay back the debt
for example if you borrow money to buy a big t v it doesn't generate income for you to pay back the debt
but if you borrow money to say buy a tractor
and that tractor let's you harvest more crops and earn more money then you can pay back your debt and improve your living standards
and in an economy with credit we can follow the transactions and see how credit creates growth
let me give you an example suppose you earn a hundred thousand dollars a year and have no debt you are credit worthy enough to borrow ten thousand dollars
say on a credit card so you can spend a hundred and ten thousand dollars even though you only earn a hundred thousand dollars
since your spending is another person's income someone is earning a hundred and ten thousand dollars
the person earning a hundred and ten thousand dollars with no debt can borrow eleven thousand dollars so he can spend a hundred and <unk> thousand dollars
even though he has only earned a hundred and ten thousand dollars
his spending is another person's income and by following the transactions we can begin to see how this process works in a self reinforcing pattern
but remember borrowing creates cycles and if the cycle goes up it eventually needs to come down
this leads us in to the short-term debt cycle
as economic activity increases we see an expansion the first phase of the short-term debt cycle
spending continues to increase and prices start to rise
this happens because the increase in spending is fueled by credit which can be created instantly out of thin air
when the amount of spending and incomes grow faster than the production of goods prices rise
when prices rise we call this inflation the central bank doesn't want too much inflation because it causes problems
seeing prices rise it raises interest rates with higher interest rates fewer people can afford to borrow money
and the cost of existing debts rises think about this as the monthly payments on your credit card going up
because people borrow less and have higher debt <unk> they have less money left over to spend so spending slows
and since one person's spending is another person's income incomes drop and so on and so forth
when people spend less prices go down we call this <unk> economic activity decreases
and we have a recession if the recession becomes too severe an inflation is no longer a problem
the central bank will lower interest rates to cause everything to pick up again
with low interest rates debt <unk> are reduced and borrowing and spending pick up and we see another expansion
as you can see the economy works like a machine
in the short-term debt cycle spending is constrained only by the willingness of lenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit
when credit is easily available there is an economic expansion when credit isn't easily available there is a recession
and note that this cycle is controlled primarily by the central bank
the short term debt cycle typically lasts five to eight years and happens over and over again for decades
but notice that the bottom and top of each cycle finish with more growth than the previous cycle and with more debt
why because people push it
they have an inclination to borrow and spend more instead of paying back debt it's human nature
because of this over long periods of time debts rise faster than incomes creating the long term debt cycle
despite people becoming more indebted lenders even more freely extend credit
why
because everyone thinks things are going great people are just focused on what's been happening lately and what's been happening lately
incomes have been rising asset values are going up the stock market <unk> it's a boom
it pays to buy goods services and financial assets with borrowed money when people do a lot of that we call it a bubble
so even though debts have been growing incomes have been growing nearly as fast to offset them let's call the ratio of debt to income the debt burden
so long as incomes continue to rise the debt burden stays manageable at the same time asset values soar
people borrow huge amounts of money to buy assets as investments causing their prices to rise even higher
people feel wealthy
so even with the accumulation of lots of debt rising incomes and asset values help borrowers remain <unk> for a long time
but this obviously can not continue forever and it doesn't
over decades debt burden slowly increase creating larger and larger debt <unk>
at some point debt <unk> start growing faster than incomes forcing people to cut back on their spending
and since one person's spending is another person's income incomes begin to go down which makes people less <unk>
causing borrowing to go down debt <unk> continue to rise which makes spending drop even further
and the cycle <unk> itself
this is the long term debt peak debt burdens have simply become too big
for the united states europe and much of the rest of the world this happened in two thousand and eight
it happened for the same reason it happened in japan in nineteen <unk> and in the united states back in nineteen <unk>
now the economy begins the leveraging
in a <unk> people cut spending incomes fall credit disappears asset prices drop
banks gets squeezed the stock market crashes social tensions rise and the whole thing starts to feed on itself the other way
as incomes fall and debt <unk> rise borrowers get squeezed no longer <unk>
credit dries up and borrowers can no longer borrow enough money to make their debt <unk>
scrambling to fill this hole borrowers are forced to sell assets the rush to sell assets floods the market at the same time as spending falls
this is when the stock market collapses the real estate market tanks and banks get into trouble
as asset prices drop the value of the collateral borrowers can put up drops this makes borrowers even less <unk>
people feel poor credit rapidly disappears
less spending less income less wealth less credit less borrowing and so on it's a vicious cycle
this appears similar to a recession but the difference here is that interest rates can't be lowered to save the day
in a recession lowering interest rates works to stimulate borrowing
however in a <unk> lowering interest rates doesn't work because interest rates are already low and soon hit zero percent so the stimulation ends
interest rates in the united states hits zero percent during the <unk> of the <unk> and again in two thousand and eight
the difference between a recession and a <unk>
is that in a <unk> borrowers debt burdens have simply gotten too big and can't be relieved by lowering interest rates
lenders realize that debts have become too large to ever be fully paid back
borrowers have lost their ability to repay and their collateral has lost value
they feel crippled by the debt they don't even want more lenders stop lending borrowers stop borrowing
think of the economy as being not <unk> just like an individual so what do you do about a <unk>
the problem is debt burdens are too high and they must come down
there are four ways this can happen one people businesses and governments cut their spending
two debts are reduced through defaults and <unk> three wealth is <unk> from the <unk> to the have <unk>
and finally four the central bank prints new money these four ways have happened in every <unk> in modern history
usually spending is cut first as we just saw a people businesses and even governments tighten their belts and cut their spending so that they can pay down their debt
this is often referred to as austerity when borrowers stop taking on new debts and start paying down the old debts
you might expect the debt burden to decrease but the opposite happens because spending is cut
and one man's spending is another man's income it causes incomes to fall
they fall faster than debts are repaid and the debt burden actually gets worse as we've seen this cut in spending is <unk> and painful
businesses are forced to cut costs which means less jobs and higher unemployment this leads to the next step debts must be reduced
many borrowers find themselves unable to repay their loans and a <unk> debts are a <unk> assets
when a <unk> doesn't repay the bank people get nervous that the bank won't be able to repay them so they rush to withdraw their money from the bank
banks gets squeezed and people businesses and banks default on their debts
this severe economic contraction is a depression
a big part of a depression is people discovering much of what they thought was their wealth isn't really there
let's go back to the bar when you bought a beer and put it on a bar tab you promised to repay the bartender
your promise became an asset of the bartender
but if you break your promise if you don't pay him back and essentially default on your bar tab then the asset he has isn't really worth anything
it has basically disappeared
many lenders don't want their assets to disappear and agree to debt restructuring
debt restructuring means lenders get paid back less or get paid back over a longer time frame or at a lower interest rate than was first agreed
somehow a contract is broken in a way that reduces debt lenders would rather have a little of something than all of nothing
even though debt disappears debt restructuring causes income and asset values to disappear faster so the debt burden continues to get worse
like cutting spending debt reduction is also painful and <unk>
all of this impacts the central government because lower incomes and less employment means the government collects fewer taxes
at the same time it needs to increase its spending because unemployment has risen
many of the unemployed have inadequate savings and need financial support from the government
additionally governments create stimulus plans and increase their spending to make up for the decrease in the economy
government's budget deficits explode in a <unk> because they spend more than they earn in taxes
this is what's happening when you hear about the budget deficit on the news
to fund their deficits governments need to either raise taxes or borrow money
but with incomes falling and so many unemployed who is the money going come from
the rich since governments need more money and since wealth is heavily concentrated in the hands of a small percentage of the people
governments naturally raise taxes on the wealthy which <unk> a redistribution of wealth in the economy from the <unk> to the <unk>
the <unk> who were suffering begin to resent the wealthy <unk>
the wealthy <unk> being squeezed by the weak economy falling asset prices and higher taxes begin to resent the <unk>
if the depression continues social disorder can break out
not only <unk> rise within countries they can rise between countries especially debtor and creditor countries
this situation can lead to political change that can sometimes be extreme
in the <unk> this led to hitler coming to power war in europe and depression in the united states
pressure to do something to end the depression increases
remember most of what people thought was money was actually credit so when credit disappears people don't have enough money
people are desperate for money and you remember who can print money the central bank can
having already lowered its interest rates to nearly zero it's forced to print money
unlike cutting spending debt reduction and wealth redistribution printing money is inflationary and <unk>
inevitably the central bank prints new money out of thin air and uses it to buy financial assets and government bonds
it happened in the united states during the great depression
and again in two thousand and eight when the united states central bank the federal reserve printed over two trillion dollars
other central banks around the world that could printed a lot of money too
by buying financial assets with this money it helps drive up asset prices which makes people more <unk>
however this only helps those who own financial assets you see the central bank can print money but it can only buy financial assets
the central government on the other hand can buy goods and services and put money in the hands of the people but it can't print money
so in order to stimulate the economy the two must cooperate
by buying government bonds the central bank essentially lends money to the government allowing it to run a deficit and increase spending
on goods and services through it's stimulus programs and on employment benefits
this increases people's income as well as the government's debt however it will lower the <unk> total debt burden
this is a very risky time policy makers need to balance the four ways that debt burdens come down
the <unk> ways need to balance with the inflationary ways in order to maintain stability
if balanced correctly there can be a beautiful <unk>
you see a <unk> could be ugly or it can be beautiful how can a <unk> be beautiful
even though a <unk> is a difficult situation handling a difficult situation in the best possible way is beautiful
a lot more beautiful than the debt fueled <unk> excesses of the leveraging phase
in a beautiful <unk> debts decline relative to income real economic growth is positive and inflation isn't a problem
it is achieved by having the right balance the right balance requires a certain mix of cutting spending reducing debt
transferring wealth and printing money so that economic and social stability can be maintained
people ask if printing money will raise inflation it won't if it <unk> fall in credit
remember spending is what matters a dollar of spending paid for with money has the same effect on prices a dollar of spending paid for with credit
by printing money the central bank can make up for the disappearance of credit with an increase in the amount of money
in order to turn things around the central bank needs to not only pump up income growth
but get the rate of income growth higher than the rate of interest on the accumulated debt
so what do i mean by that basically income needs to grow faster than debt grows
for example let's assume that a country going through a <unk> has a debt to income ratio of a hundred percent
that means that the amount of debt it has is the same as the amount of income the entire country makes in a year
now think about the interest rate on that debt let's say it's two percent
if debt is growing at two percent because of that interest rate and income is only growing at around one percent you will never reduce the debt burden
you need to print enough money to get the rate of income growth above the rate of interest
however printing money could easily be abused because it's so easy to do and people prefer it to the alternatives
the key is to avoid printing too much money and causing <unk> high inflation the way germany did during it's <unk> in the <unk>
if policy makers achieve the right balance a <unk> isn't so dramatic growth is slow but debt burdens go down
that's a beautiful <unk> when incomes begin to rise borrowers begin to appear more <unk>
and when borrowers appear more <unk> lenders begin to lend money again debt burdens finally begin to fall
able to borrow money people can spend more eventually the economy begins to grow again leading to the <unk> phase of the long-term debt cycle
though the <unk> process can be horrible if handled badly if handled well it will eventually fix the problem
it takes roughly a decade or more for debt burdens to fall and economic activity to get back to normal hence the term lost decade
<unk> of course the economy is a little bit more complicated than this template suggests
however laying the short-term debt cycle on top of the long-term debt cycle and then laying both of them on top of the productivity growth line
gives a reasonably good template for seeing where we've been where we are now and where we're probably headed
so in summary there are three rules of thumb that i'd like you to take away from this
first don't have debt rise faster than income because your debt burdens will eventually crush you
second don't have income rise faster than productivity because you'll eventually become <unk>
and third do all that you can to raise your productivity because in the long run that's what matters most
this is simple advice for you and it's simple advice for policy makers
you might be surprised but most people including most policy makers don't pay enough attention to this
this template has worked for me and i hope it will work for you thank you
as we begin our journey to the world of economics i thought i would begin with a quote from one of the most famous economist of all times
the scottish philosopher adam smith and he really is kind of the first real economist in in the way that we view it now and this is from his
the wealth of nations published in seventeen <unk> <unk> the same year as the american declaration of independence
and its one of his the most famous excerpts he generally indeed he being an economic actor neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it
by directing that industry so the industry in control of that individual actor in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value he intends only his own gain
he intends only his own gain and he is in this as in many other cases led by an invisible hand to promote an end
which was no part of his intention and this term invisible hand is famous led by the invisible hand to promote an end
which was no part of his attention he is saying look when individual actor just act in their own self-interest that often in aggregate leads to things that each of those individual actor did not intend
and then he says nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it so its not always necessarily a bad thing by <unk> his own interest
he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it so this is a pretty strong statement
its really at the core of capitalism and that's why i point out that it was published the same year as the american declaration of independence because obviously
america the founding fathers they wrote the declaration of independence the constitution it really talks about what it means to be a democratic country what are the rights of its citizens
but the united states in its overall ah ah the overall experience of an american is at least influenced by the work of adam smith
by these kind of foundational ideas of capitalism and it just both happened to happen around the same time
but this idea its not always that intuitive individual actors by ah by essentially <unk> their own <unk> ends might be doing more for society
then when they then if any of them actually try to promote the overall wellbeing of society and i don't think adam smith would say there's always good
for someone to act <unk> or that its never good for people to actually think about the the implications of what they are doing to aggregate sense but he's saying that frequently
frequently this <unk> action could lead to the greater good could lead to more innovation could lead to better investment
could lead to more productivity could lead to more wealth more more ah a larger pie for everyone
and now economists frequently and and when he makes a statement he's actually making a mix of a micro economic and macro economic statement
micro is that people individual actors are acting in their own self-interest and the macro is that it might be good for the economy or for the nation as a whole
and so now modern economist tend to divide themselves into these two schools or into these two subjects micro economics
micro economics which was the study of individual actors micro economics those actors could be firms it could be people or could be households
and you have macro economics which was the study of the economy and aggregate macro
economics and you get it from their words
micro the <unk> refers to very small things macro refers to the larger the bigger picture and so micro economics just to re state is is essentially
how actors actors make decisions make decisions or i guess we could say <unk> <unk> decisions slash
<unk> <unk> of scarce resources and you're going to hear the word scarce resources a lot when people talk about economics
and a scarce resources the one that you don't have an infinite amount of for example love might not be a scarce resource you might have an infinite amount of love
but a resources that would be scarce is something like food or water or money or time or labour these are all scarce resources
and so micro economics well how do people decide where to put those scarce resources how do they decide where to deploy them and how does that how does that affect prices and markets and whatever else
macro economics is the study of of what happens in aggregate to an economy so aggregate what happens in aggregate
to an economy from the millions of individual actors aggregate aggregate economy we have now have millions
millions of actors and it often focuses on policy related questions so do you raise or lower taxes or what's going to happen when you raise or lower taxes
do you regulate or <unk> how does that affect the overall <unk> when you do these so its policy
top top down top down questions and in both macro and micro economics there is a there's a especially in the modern sense of it
there is an attempt to make them rigorous to make them mathematical so in either case you can start with some of the ideas some of the philosophical ideas or the logical ideas
to say someone like an adam smith might have so you have kind of you have these and ah they are basic ideas about about how people think how people make decisions
so philosophy philosophy of of people of decision making in the case of in the case of micro economics decision making
and then you'll make some assumptions about it or you'll simplify it so i'll do the right this you'll simplify it
and you really are simplifying this you say ah all people are rational all people are gonna act in their own self-interest or all people are going to maximize the gain which isn't true
human beings are motivated by a whole bunch of things but you simplify these things so that you can start to deal with it in a kind of mathematical way
so you simplify it so you can start dealing it within at a mathematical sense so this is valuable it can not clarify your thinking it can not allow you to approve things
to based on your assumptions and so that you can start to visualize things mathematically with charts and graphs and think about what will actually happen with markets
so its very very valuable to have this mathematical rigorous thinking but at the same time it can be a little bit dangerous because you are making this huge simplification
and sometimes the math might lead you to some very strong conclusions conclusions which you might feel very strongly about because it looks like you've prove you've proving them
the same way that you might prove relativity but they were based on some some assumptions that either might be wrong or might be over <unk> or might not be relevant
to the context that you're trying to make conclusions about so it's very very very important to take it all with the grain of thought to remember that its all based on some simplifying assumptions
and macro economics is probably even more guilty of it in micro economics you're taking these deeply complicated things that human brain help people act and respond to each other
and you're and then you're aggregating it over millions of people so its ultra complicated you have millions of these infinitely complicated people all interacting with each other so
it's very complicated many millions of interactions and fundamentally unpredictable interactions and then trying to make assumptions on those
trying to make assumptions and then doing and then doing math with that that could lead you to some conclusions or might lead you to some predictions
and once again it's very important this is valuable it's valuable to make these mathematical ah models to make these mathematical assumptions these mathematical conclusions
but always needs to be taken with a grain of salt and so that you have a proper grain of salt and so that you are always focused on the true intuition
and that's really the most important thing to get from a course on of ah economics so that you can truly reason through what's likely to happen maybe even without the mathematics
i'll leave you with two quotes and these quotes are a little bit they're a little bit funny but they're really i think are helpful things to keep in mind as you start especially go deep into the mathematical side
of economics so this right over here is a quote by alfred <unk> who was a publisher in who ah in the nineteen hundreds
an economist as a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible and i'm assuming when he's talking about the incomprehensible he's referring to some of the <unk> stuff that you see
and economics and hopefully we'll make this as incomprehensible as as possible and see that there is value in this but its a very important statement he's making
often times its stating a common sense thing its stating something that's obvious it's obvious and its very important to always keep that in mind
to always make sure that you have the intuition for what's happening in the math or to know when the math is going in a direction that might be strange based on over simplification
the wrong assumptions and then you have this quote over here by laurence j peter most famous for peter's principle professor at u s e
an economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicated yesterday didn't happen today and once again important to keep in the back of one's mind
because especially and this is especially relevant to macro economics because in macro economics there's all sorts of a predictions about the state of the economy
what needs to be done how long will the recession last what will be the economic growth next year what will inflation do and they often proved to be wrong
in facts few economists even tend to agree on many of these saying and it's very important to realize that because often times when you are deep in the mathematics of the economics it might seem
to be a science like physics but its not a science like physics there's open it is open to <unk>
and a lot of that <unk> is all around is all around the assumptions that you choose to make
alright i think we're at time so let's get started um welcome to folks i don't know i'm doctor laurie santos a professor here at yale university
and the teacher of the science of well being course on coursera dot org and a host of the happiness lab podcast
we wanted to do this facebook live event today because i know all of you are struggling with <unk>
and all the anxieties and the uncertainties that come with it ah we know of course all the physical things we need to do to protect our physical health right we should be washing our hands and socially distancing and so on
but i think a lot of us are struggling right now with the kinds of things we should be doing to protect our mental health
and we need to be just as intentional about protecting our own anxieties and <unk> and sort of fixing that as we are protecting our physical health
and this call today is to answer all your questions about that type of things that science suggest that we can do to promote our mental health in this challenging time
what i'm gonna be doing is answering all of your questions so please be sending them in on the side
um if you haven't yet sent us an emoji to let us know you are there please let us know
um and i think since we have such a short time i think we're just gonna jump right into it
um you'll see me kinda looking over at the side on my chat screen ah to see what the questions are
and the first question we have today is from elizabeth who asks do you have any advice on dealing with reducing tension and arguing in your relationship during these stay at home orders
and this one's a big one i think you're speaking to me i think a lot of us are facing the challenge right now
that we're spending more time with our spouses with our partners with our kids
and that can be incredibly challenging normally but it's especially challenging in other wise anxiety provoking time
and so i think the first piece of advice i have is to just validate that like yeah this is a big thing we are all struggling with
but then to sort of encourage everyone to be a little bit patient
um the research on relationships it will allow relationships to succeed books like professor eli <unk> and others
they really suggest that a lot of our <unk> success has to to with our expectations
and i think if anything we might wanna just be a little <unk> about our expectations for our spouses than we might have been before
all of us are going through the struggling time and so if you have a spouse who say you know didn't empty the dishwasher or isn't doing their part as much with kids
i think this is a time to be compassionate both with them and with yourself
and it's a kinda <unk> expectations a little bit
but the particular advice i would give is if you think about relationship with your spouse there's always things that we really love about our spouse that ah ah in a relationship we do very very well together
and this is the time to double down on those good things
so if you both connect ah in term of hanging out with the kids and working with the kids that's the time to double down on life
you both connect on humor you know now is the time to be watching a comedy movie together
and so the basic advice is to kinda show them in yourself a little compassion like now is the time to kinda down regulate your expectations
but also if there are things that are good in your relationship be very intentional about promoting those in this tough time
and that sometimes requires a little creativity in of your ah you think you are great with with your spouses going out to dinner and having these wonderful outdoor dates
you might need to get creative or with a little creativity you can really patch up a relationship
and kind of down regulate the stress that we see
remember in natural disaster as it is a time that we see things like divorce rates increasing
but it's also the time that we see a new <unk> forming people making babies
um it really depends on your intentional efforts you can make this challenging time better in your relationship
so that was elizabeth's question next question we have up is from melissa
um she asks how do we stay informed with current updated news without increasing our anxious feelings we may have
ah this is another one i'm struggling with as well like like you i want to be informed about what's going on in my town you know what has the president said recently and so on
but i feel like every time i watch the news i can watch my anxiety sky rocket
um in terms of what anxiety feels like in the body for me that's watching my chest <unk> and watching myself breath faster it just kinda doesn't feel good
and so this is a real challenge of how to stay informed without creating more anxiety
ah the way i have been able to solve it myself is to kinda do that paying attention that mindfulness about what the news is making me feel
and there's time when it feels like information and there's time when it feels like i'm already really anxious
i don't wanna add to that by adding any more news on to it
and so i think the key is to just be really deliberate about what you are consuming
and also we have some choice about what you are consuming you can pay attention to what's going on but try to up regulate the information about the positive news
so for example there's a wonderful hashtag on twitter called covid kindness which you can use to check out to see all the good things that are happening out there
and so i think trying to balance some of the doom and gloom that you are seeing and some of the positive things can be really powerful
ah but but honestly what i have done my self is to really decrease the amount of news that i'm consuming
um particularly before i go to bed i now have a rule like basically past six or seven p m
i put my phone away i'm on social media as much i'm really trying to not be consuming the news at bed time
cause i'm watching it mindfully and noticing that it's affecting my sleep
um most of that information is gonna be there in the next morning and so find ways to protect your sleep and to pack protect your own anxiety levels
and it's okay and be <unk> if you need to avoid some of that stuff
again the twenty-four hour news cycle is gonna be back when you look again you're not gonna miss too much
um so next question are are this comes from a a bunch of folks lee and jenna and anna are all asking similar questions about the mental health needs for frontline workers
um they ask basically how can frontline workers and healthcare workers generally practice self-care and combat anxiety you know what what's the best way to support these workers
um i'm so glad this question came up and it's great that it came up so from so many folks
because this is something that i care about very deeply i'm so grateful that there are healthcare workers out there really risking their health and their lives
to protect me and my family and my community so thank you with the gratitude for the fact that you are doing that
i think there are a lots of intentional things that even folks around their frontline can do to protect their mental health in this scary time
um one of those things comes from a <unk> that you really need to protect you own mental health needs during this time
and that means explicitly taking time to kinda of pay attention to your anxiety levels and watch the things you can do to deal with that
i think in between patience if you can give yourself a break for it say three conscious breaths
three very slow breaths where you breathe into your belly
and just kinda of have a moment to take a second and be present
um those things will down regulate your sympathetic nervous system that'll kick in the <unk> activity that we know allows for kind of your rest and digest
and the more you can so take short breaks to do that all the more powerful
i think a second thing i would say for healthcare workers is to make sure that you're reframing what you are doing in as positive a way as possible
mean ultimately you're doing something that's incredibly brave that's helping folks that some times in the frantic day to day <unk> of that you can lose that
um and there's a lots of research by folks like david <unk> and others that shows that taking time to realize that what you're doing is <unk> helping other people
recognizing that it's a <unk> action can actually allow you a little bit more resilience in it can actually <unk> what's called your <unk> your ability to do hard things
and so i think kind of turning on your compassion muscles turning on this idea that you're doing something <unk> can be incredibly powerful
and the final quick tip this is a more of a practice tip but for a healthcare workers right now is that
there is lots of evidence that specific kinds of meditation practices can reduce burnout even in incredibly stressful times
this is true for healthcare workers but also service providers and even folks like who work at at the grocery store who really have to give up and sacrifice right now to help other people
and the specific kind of meditation is what's known as loving kindness meditation or matter
it's basically a meditation practice where you work on practicing compassion you actually think about different people in your life
and extend to them information about being happy and healthy
you actually use a mantra of may you be happy may you be healthy
but the research suggest that the simple act they're doing this even rarely temporarily can allow you to feel compassion this urge to help people without the empathy that goes with it
in other words without the kind of burnout that comes from feeling those other people's emotions
i think this can be an incredibly powerful technique for healthcare workers right now and you can start it today
um lots of free apps online from inside timer to calm to even ten percent happier ah with dan harris there
allowing the healthcare worker to use these things freely available
and they're allowing those healthcare workers to access love and kindness meditation specifically
so jump on and do one of these meditations even for five minutes in the morning you know when you're taking your shower
it's the kind of thing that can really improve your ah kind of resilience and protect you from burnout later on
okay so that was ah about healthcare workers now we have a new trust ah question from tracy
tracy asks how do you keep yourself positive during this time when living alone when you're away from your family and friends
ah i think this one is the the flip side of the question that was asked earlier about how to deal with the stress of living with your spouse
there's a different kind of stress that comes from living alone and being away from family and friends in this really hard time
i think the answer to this one is that you can be physically alone without being socially alone
in other words you can be using technology to reach out to all those friends and family members
and i think in this scary time we need to be doing this even more than ever and even more intentionally than ever
you know it's one thing to kind of be home alone but it's another to know that you have you know zoom yoga classes with friend of yours
or zoom dinner date with your parents who are far away in different time zones
these are the kind of things you can built into your day even if you're living alone and i think that's really critical
one thing to know is that the science suggest that the act of intentionally connecting in real time you know kind of how we're doing right now where i were i'm talking to you and you are hearing me in real time
that can be almost just good as a regular social connection and we should be embracing these a lot more
i think another thing you can do if you are living alone is to embrace the kinds of things that solitude gives you in term of other mental health benefits
so i'm thinking about things like quite time for meditation
or even alone time so that you can engage in a little bit more exercise you know
grab a yoga mat even from a small apartment and do one of the many free online exercise classes that are coming now
i think if you are alone in this crisis it can actually provide some time to reset things and focus on your own mental health
in a way that might be tricky if you're not some sheltering in place in that very strange situation
ah and so that was ah <unk> question now we're moving on to <unk> ah <unk> is asking how can we stay focused sane and productive at work
particularly with the big elephant in the room which is the threat of layoffs
ah this is another really huge one and i think i wanna start with this question first by validating it
yeah a lot of us are facing the possibility of being laid off from work having less hours
in addition to this physical height crises and this mental health crises a lot of us are facing a real economic crises and that's incredibly scary
and so i think the first thing is to just have some <unk> with yourself about the fact that we're going through this
u i'm experiencing this now with many of my graduate and p h d students
who feel like well they should be working and being just as productive as before but that can't possibly be true because we're in the midst of a pandemic where everyone is stressed
and even if we're reacting to it really well one day that doesn't mean that the next day we were won't feel it really deeply and be unable to work
and so i think the first piece of advice is just allow yourself some <unk>
you know give yourself the same <unk> as you would give to a friend who is going to that sort of same thing
all of us right now are gonna be a little less productive than usual
um the second piece of advice is actually to remember some of the causal arrows you've heard about on the podcast and in my class
in other words that we often think that productivity we need to figure it out first and then we'll be happy because we'll be productive at work
but the research actually suggest the other arrow i know the words that by focusing on our mental health during this time it can actually increase our productivity
and so that would be the direction i suggest you think about going what can you do to reduce your anxiety right now
to bump up your social connection so you feel little bit more like connected and trusting about your community
what you can you do to increase a little bit of exercise lately those type of things will bump up your mental health
and by focusing on that you'll end up increasing your productivity exactly
and so those would be my kind of productivity tips first of all just like it's not gonna be the same
no one is gonna be the same and in a some ways the whole world is in this boat
so kinda lay off yourself of the feel guilt a little bit because we're kinda all going through it
and the second is that if you really wanna focus on productivity you need to give yourself some space to do the things that will really help your mental health too
okay um so that was <unk> ah now we have a similar question from angela who's asked ah be more specifically i've been laid off because of <unk>
how do i do the soul searching necessary to figure out what i want to do next and what jobs and industries are gonna be fulfilling
um i think again this is one of these ways of using the negative things in life to sort of see the blessings inside of them
again you know losing your job is an awful thing to have happened and it comes with a lot of uncertainties
but it also brings with it the possibility of new directions
like you can start thinking more about what are the things that you found meaningful about your job
what are the types of things that you are like to build into a job that's coming next
again so many of us are in this crisis right now and going through these things
but also all of us or most of us are gonna get through to the other side
when we're in the crux of it it's hard to think that there's gonna be another side cause right now we are just facing uncertainty of kind of you know months inside and what does that mean
well like all crises we're going to get to the other side
and even those of you who are going to economic and other <unk> right now are going to find other options when you get out
and i think you can use this time to do some real soul searching
um one of the kinda blessings of being in a position of maybe losing your job or losing some hours at work
is that you wind up having a time <unk> you wind up having more time
and that means that you can have the the blessing of having what's called time <unk> that sort of feeling of being wealthy in time
um if you can kinda get around the uncertainty of having the extra time it can actually be a really powerful time to do things like take time to journal about what you find most meaningful
um or engage in the kinds of ah strategies that researches like amy <unk> and other uses to job craft
do you really think about what you find most meaningful in your work and sort of plan that moving forward
um if you're taking the class angela i will also suggest this is a great time to go back to that strength test you might recall
trying to focus on your character strengths and getting a sense of what those are that might be a good time to figure out what parts of your work are are mapping on to those strengths
and if you're looking for work in the future what you could do with that kind of to to build those up and a even more robust way
alright so that was the question from angela we are cruising through all these questions thank you so much for sending in all these great ones
the next one up is from jessica and jessica notes i've been doing okay so far but one of my children has been really sad about missing school and his friends is there any way i can help him
and again just start by just validating this you know this is a scary and uncertain and an anxiety provoking time for us
it's so much worse for our children right who who really just don't have that kind of frontal lobe tools to regulate about this crisis
and so i think anything you can do to help their anxiety their uncertainty can be incredibly powerful
the first tip i would give for helping kids during this tough time is to make sure that they have a routine
one of the problems about being out of school and out of the typical day that's kids face is that they are used to having a certain routine and now it's gone away
and we as humans are creatures of habit like we can work best and feel less anxious when we're in a consistent schedule and a consistent routine
so even if your kids aren't in a consistent schedule right now you should make one up for them
you should find a way that you know like breakfast is from nine to ten and from ten to eleven
you know you're doing your math homework or maybe you're watching cartoons or may be get to play video games it kinda doesn't matter
but just have a consistent schedule that you end up and kind of announcing to your kids and sticking with
ah the other piece of advice i would give is is again to to do the same thing that we need to do when we are feeling anxious and we are feeling stressed and we're feeling sad in other words the kinda same types of tips i was just talking about um
kids too can benefit from having social connection through things like zoom and so on
um for older kids that can be the same we do it as adults
but even for younger kids that can be the kind of thing that you setup and structure
um my colleague <unk> <unk> ah who is a social psychologist who was on the happiness lab podcast
he has really younger kids and he knows that he and his friends are setting up clay dates over zoom
they are kinda going online and printing out the same coloring pages so that kids can color together color the same thing
across the way across zoom and that can be really powerful kinda giving the structure of social connection back to your kids when they need it
um but another thing to build in i think would be to allow kids to see that again this isn't all doom and groom
if you look like there are heroes and real stories of kindness out there
and so another tip would be to kinda expose your kids to the fact that there are good things happening
um have tell them your stories about covid kindness that you're reading about in the news
talk to them about the heroes that are doing great things
um and then allow them to experience the fact that there is good stuff out there as well
i think the third and final tip is that you know you being the head of the house are going to have a huge emotional impact on your kids
um we if you listened for past episodes of the happiness lab you've heard about cases of emotional contagion
and the fact that we are often part of these effective spirals
where one member of our team or families feels a certain way feels <unk> and in that panic can be <unk> and it <unk> and it gets worse
remember that you can be the calm in the storm for your kids you know if you take time to regulate your own anxiety you know do your own deep breaths before you face them
if you're describing this part of this situation as a challenge not a crisis you are going to transmit that calm and that those positive states to them
and that can be incredibly important you know one of the best things you can do right now to help you community is to be <unk> those positive emotions yourself
and that often needs doing the right things to protect your own well being the kinds of things that we have been talking about
okay ah so that's one was from jessica now we are moving on to one from lindsey
um lindsey asks in your course we learned about how experiences and not things make us happy
in this time of social <unk> and <unk> are there any suggestions you have for experiences we could create independently or with our families
um i love this question inquired because it's you know doing all the things that i suggest right which is like being proactive
you know using the the topics that we have heard about in the course and interventions we have seen in the course in this special time
i think one of the odd but great things about this current time is that we are all in a new situation
like we are all faced with being at home in a way we haven't been before we have more time with our kids more time with our families and things like that
all the research and psychology suggest that we can harness these new situations to form new different habits
in other words we can start things that we hadn't tried before you know new game nights new family dinners new traditions
all these things because we are in this moment where we start a new situation
are easy the harness we can harness what i called the fresh starts ah which is ah some wonderful research by katie milkman and others
shows that these new situations and these new moments of fresh starts allow us to form habits better
and so i think this is the time to think about what creative experience is you could come up with with your family
you know well maybe you start cooking dinner with your family in a different way maybe you start zooming you know grandma and grandpa into your zoom meetings
well maybe you all engage in a yoga class or some crazy exercise together
maybe this is the time to start that gratitude you know three good things that you list before dinner with your family
all these things are easier to start their experiences that are easier to get going
cause we don't really have norms that our families are supposed to do during this time it's so new
and that provides this real opportunity if you can harness it to put good things in place for yourself and for your family
and so i think before those experiences you know get really creative and and that can be with your kids but it can also with your spouses
um you know we can't necessarily go out on the typical boring dinner dates or go to that same restaurant you went to every single week
so try something new whether that's you know a a new like spot in a house to have the dinner a new candle like put down a table clock like try a new meal like
you can create these novel experiences and if you frame these things as novel experiences that can be powerful for your well being as well
okay so that was <unk> question moving on where we're really scrolling through some intruding you again to send in you questions if you hadn't yet we have about ten more minutes in this chat so send them in
um next question comes from sheryl and sheryl asks what should we do about sleep problems i can't sleep anxiety uncertainty <unk>
um sheryl you are really speaking to me because i was going through this pretty badly ah about last week
when i was just realizing that i just was unable to kinda fall asleep
you know even though i was trying to get out of bed at a reasonable hour you know my mind was like
it was really really hard
and so i'll share with you the things that i've done to promote sleep and they are all things that come from the research
um one of these is to harness the power of ritual before you go to sleep
um there's lots of fantastic work by mike norton and <unk> <unk> showing the power of ritual to control things when things feel out of control
um and i think right now you know one of the things that's preventing us from sleeping is that every thing feels really out of control
and so i was started some you know seemingly dumb like private sleep rituals you know i kinda setup at night and kinda remake my bed if my bed wasn't made before
um i have found out the all like <unk> that i have you know in my cabinet that i haven't used in a while
like every night before i go to bed i kinda like you know put some lotion on and try to be really mindful about the way it smells and the way it feels and kinda get into bed it sounds really silly
by harnessing this ritual the science suggest can kinda make you feel a little bit more in control
and it can also train your body that like oh wait after i do the ritual the lotion then i go to bed
and second thing that i've done and this is probably then even more powerful is to really regulate how much anxiety provoking material i'm looking at right before i go to bed
um i know i've told lots of view about the the danger of phones and particularly the dangers of phones right before you go to sleep
but this is a time where we really need to be following that advice
ah basically i have a rule now that after eight p m i put my phone away i just put it on silent
i put it in a specific spot in my bedroom and i'm not allowed to use it anymore
ah which is tricky for me because i'm really use to kinda scrolling and using my phone before i go to bed
but i've tried to substitute that habit with something else because as we know from our habit research ah if you have a queue but no action to do it can be really hard to overcome a bad habit from before
and so my new ah my new habit when i have the queue like i really wanna check my phone before bed is a physical book i've just found old books at my house that i either wanna read or sitting on that shelf and have a had a chance to yet and those are there
and so those different habits of kinda beginning a sort of sleep ritual it's like healthier
and getting rid of the phone which is bad because if it's a lie but also because on the other hand that phone right now has a lot of anxiety provoking content that can be really powerful for me
and i guess maybe the third thing is just to prioritize it
um i've been trying to you know given that we all have a little bit many of us has a little bit more flexibility with our work time
i've been really trying to move any work meeting that are early in the morning to a little bit later
so even if i can't get to sleep or i'm having some restless sleep i'll have a little bit more time to make it up these days
and so highly highly encourage you to prioritize sleep remember sleep essential for your mental health but it's also one of the other thing you can do right now to protect your immune function
during a time when we all really need to make sure our immune function is as high and as effective as it can possibly be
okay so up next question ah <unk> is here and she is asking
i've a couple of family members that have tested positive for <unk> i feel like my mind is focused only on that so how do you suppose i go about my day with caring for my family but also taking care of my own mental health
i think this is again i'll start by doing i think what's important here which is to validate this
um many of us are going through the situation where we know people who are positive for <unk> or presume positive for <unk> and get different scarier situation you know can't get tested
um and that's incredibly scary and sometimes that comes with the additionally awful thing that um if you are trying to physically distance yourself or if you're in a vulnerable position yourself
you might not even be able to to help them in the normal way because you might need to maintain some distance from them
and so i think the first thing to do with this is to have some <unk> this is <unk> bad situation
and you kinda just need to be nice to yourself and stop feeling guilty
um if you're in the position where you want to be helping your family members and are feeling frustrated that you can't interact with them directly
this is for people who for example have family members who are faraway or family members who are vulnerable who we can't get to
i think one thing the research suggest you can do to help with that is to allow those person to urges to come out another way and there are other elderly family members you can help
or something else you can do that's doing good in the world even if you can't do good for that one person i think that can be particularly powerful
um but in terms of just gonna going to that situation with them remember i think part of it is to find ways to reduce your own sympathetic nervous system activity
i think the stress of having family members who are sick on our own bodies can be incredibly anxiety provoking
and i think you need to just take time to kinda breathe and again which after a little bit before about kinda doing these slower breaths these belly breaths we talking a lot about on our podcast and things
but that's the time to do that sort of deep breathing and again that's useful
because it's going to help your of own immune function it's gonna some shut off that fight or flight sympathetic nervous acts system activity
and allow you to turn on that's <unk> nervous activity which is what we need right now to sort of rest and digest and now will help your immune function
but it'll also give you the bandwidth to deal with that stressful situation
remember even if it doesn't feel like it there's a lot that you can do to embody calm yourself in order to help the other people in your life
and so very very hard and scary situation completely validating that
but it can know that there's simple action you can take to kinda take control of your own emotions and sort of work with them even in this really scary time
final question cause we are hurry out of time ah our final question comes from holly
who asks ah that her question is around trying to do random acts of kindness and make social connections during this time
she has a few ideas in mind but it's hard to find ways in everyday life when you are in isolation to do this more
um agree completely you know in in that in the course in on the podcast we talk a lot about these
kinda random social connections you know the chatting with the <unk> social connections that happened ah regularly you know this is the stuff that went missing more and more now
and so one of the tips i've been giving is to try to build in social connection that's not the like very formal conference call with the folks at work but really informal type things
you know like i'm gonna do a yoga class um just like call you know text a few friends and say who a hey who wants to jump in with me
or i'm gonna have a half hour where i'm chopping vegetables and trying to deal with whatever's in my pantry to cook tonight
ah let me see if i can zoom a friend who can jump in with me then
i think these informal social interactions can be incredibly powerful
we have to intentionally build them in in a way that we didn't before but two things there one is that just takes a little bit more work
and the second thing is if you form the right habit now you might be able to import that later
so that when this whole crisis is over you are doing those things as well
in terms of the the random acts of kindness part i think there are so many things we can be doing to reach out to others
one is just to recognize that this act of sheltering in place staying home is a <unk> action you are helping other people and helping to flatten the curve
maybe saving a thousands of lives by your simple actions so make sure you reframe it that way
but the other thing is to use whatever <unk> you have whether that's extra time cause you are not working as much
or little financial <unk> you know those of you who aren't paying gas to commute or buying that coffee at the coffee shop regularly that you normally buy
those are little financial <unk> that you can use to help other people
and so what can you use to to use that money to say help local businesses who need some help or if you just have extra time what can you do to kinda contact elderly family members who might need a connection right now
or even talk to your congress people about what they should be doing like these are the times when we can use our temporal <unk> our times <unk> to help other people alive
okay i think that was a lot i hope that you heard some fantastic suggestions
um i want you to keep in mind the the main thing that i keep mentioning which is <unk>
this is a really challenging time and it's important to be nice to yourself
but one of the things you can do to be nice to yourself is to remember what science suggests about the kinds of things that can improve your wellbeing
um we know that you are washing your hands doing good stuff for your physical health i hope this is giving you a bunch of tips for what you can do for your mental health too
um there are so many comments on there sending gratitude my way thank you so much you are very welcome
i hope this is giving you some useful tips and i thank you for signing on thank you all so much
we start this <unk> with this course
how google does m l where i introduce machine learning and what google means when we say we are a i first
my colleague josh then comes in to talk about the strategy of machine learning
we end with a discussion of two link of how to do machine learning at scale using python notebooks and server less data processing components
now if you are an engineer or a scientist you'll probably thinking that this all too high level
and you're ready to jump to the next course which starts to delve into technical details of <unk> flow but before you make that decision let me tell you something
when we taught this set of courses to our customers
one remark that often came back was that the module by josh was the one they revisited the most often
after they went back to work six months later the module that they went to to look at the most wasn't the strategy of machine learning
so you want to get the big picture before you delve into that technical details
because the big picture is very important for you to be able to get by end from the rest of the organization to carry out
we then move on to doing machine learning with tensorflow that involves two aspects
one creating a good <unk> dataset and two building your first <unk> model with <unk> flow
creating a machine learning dataset is another of those practical modules that you don't want to ignore
when you create a <unk> model and it works well in your experiments but then fails miserably in production
the reason will often comeback to how you created the <unk> dataset so give yourself time to absorb the lessons
and then we have two courses that are about improving <unk> accuracy
as you build your first machine learning model you will learn that they are lots of things we can do to improve that model
so think of this section as filling your tool chest with the set of ideas
you'll use different ideas in different situations so you'll find that knowing them will be helpful in your career as you solved different machine learning problems
and as before it's not enough to just name check these concepts you need to give yourself time to understand them
and know how to implement them in code we then move on to set of courses that are about <unk> the machine learning model
as i mentioned earlier <unk> a machine learning model
and by that i mean training it at scale in a distributed way serving out the predictions
building a machine learning model end to end <unk> a machine learning model can be super hard
it is a stage where most enterprise machine learning projects fail
i cannot tell you how many companies i've talked to who've said their innovation teams had devised these cool m l projects but they were struggling getting the m l models into production
in this set of courses we will talk about how to train deploy and predict with m l models in a way that they're production ready
and finally we delve back into machine learning theory but theory in big air coats
machine learning theory is mostly <unk> machine learning is an intensely heuristic discipline
and you're only as good as your bag of tools and tricks
so we'll introduce a number of tools and tricks that work with the inputs to your machine learning models or images
tools and tricks that help when you are processing or <unk> sequences
and sequences in machine learning can be either time series data or text data
and finally we will look at several ways to build powerful recommendation systems
recommendation systems are how you've build personalized algorithms
and so it's something that most m l engineers build at some point in their careers
in fact it might be the only m l system that many people will built
but in order to built powerful recommendation engines it turns out that you need to understand tools and tricks
that are borrowed from images and from sequences
so that's why we are looking at them at this order and that's why we look at recommendation engines pretty much at the end of the <unk>
now you may have encountered some of the this material before especially in the first four courses
for example in the courses i'm creating machine learning datasets
and on tensorflow basics some of the slides will be a repeat of server less machine learning with tensorflow that's available on coursera
similarly if you encounter google's machine learning crash course this is an internal google course but it has also been taught on some university campuses
you might find some of the material and feature representation and art and science of m l to be familiar
in spite of this though the details are quite different so don't skip it completely
treat these courses as a useful refresher and make sure that you'll still remember the ideas presented in those sections
welcome to the first course of the blockchain <unk> title blockchain basics
let's start by asking ourselves what is a blockchain why should you care about it
unlike traditional methods blockchain enables peer to peer transfer of digital assets without any <unk>
it was a technology originally created to support the famous cryptocurrency bitcoin
the blockchain by itself has taken a life of its own and <unk> a broad range of applications across many industries including finance healthcare government manufacturing and distribution
the blockchain is poised to innovate and transform a wide range of applications including goods transfer for example supply chain digital media transfer for example sale of art
remote services delivery example travel and tourism platform for decentralized business logic for example moving computing to data sources
and distributed intelligence example education credential
additional applications of blockchain include distributed resources for example power generation and distribution
crowd funding for example startup fund raising crowd operation for example electronic voting identity management for example one i d for all your life's functions
and government public records and open governing
moreover blockchain can enable an inclusive economy it can enable a person in a remote corner of the world to partake in a democratic process
opportunities for innovative applications are endless
that is a dire need for critical thinkers designers and developers who can envision and create newer application models on blockchain to benefit the world
this course is a first step in addressing this need
at the end of this course you will be able to explain the three fundamental characteristic that define the blockchain using bitcoin blockchain
bitcoin is not the only player in town by the end of the first module we'll move beyond bitcoin into introducing the next generation blockchains with ethereum
you will also be able to discuss the important features of ethereum blockchain that is used as a reference implementation in many newer blockchain
and explain the algorithms and techniques that enable the blockchain including a public cryptography and <unk>
finally you will be able to outline methods for realizing trust in a blockchain
let's begin with an introduction of bitcoin
two major contributions of cryptocurrency bitcoin are a continuously working digital currency system and a model for autonomous decentralized application technology called a blockchain
though our focus is on a general blockchain we have to understand the working of the technology behind bitcoin to fully appreciate the innovation of blockchain
we can all agree that the advent of the internet and the world wide web has transformed every aspect of our lives from stock markets to street corner food trucks
it has enabled the technology explosion with web two point o and the world of e-commerce applications
around two thousand eight two thousand nine when the institutions and markets we trusted were crumbling down and everybody was running away from the wall street
a mysterious person or persons called <unk> <unk> introduced a new digital currency a cryptocurrency called bitcoin
bitcoin enabled an innovative platform for peer to peer transfer of value without any central authority
with no central authority how did bitcoin realize trust and security
by implementing software programs for validation verification consensus in a novel infrastructure called the blockchain
later on in about in <unk> <unk> computational elements were added to the blockchain infrastructure
that has opened up a whole world of possibilities beyond simple currency transfer
these innovations are significantly shaping the direction of web three point o as you will learn in the next four courses
what is a blockchain blockchain is about enabling peer to peer transaction in a decentralized network
establishing trust among unknown peers
recording the transaction in an immutable distributed ledger
let's understand centralized versus decentralized network using a common scenario
consider a scenario where a customer wants to buy an item using her credit card
let's <unk> the <unk> involved in accomplishing this task
we have a credit card agency we have a customer bank we have a credit <unk> bank we have an exchange we have the <unk> bank and finally the merchant
this is an example of a centralized system that we are so used to
now compare this with a system where peers can <unk> directly with each other irrespective of where they are located
functions of the <unk> are shifted to the periphery to the peer participant in the blockchain infrastructure
peers are not necessarily known to each other this is a decentralized system
how do we establish trust among the peers in such a decentralized system
by having a process and place to validate verify and confirm transactions
record the transaction in the distributed ledger of blocks
create a <unk> record of blocks chain of blocks
and implement a consensus protocol for agreement on the block to be added to the chain
so validation verification consensus and immutable recording lead to the trust and security of the blockchain
now i will explain these concepts using another scenario
i am lending amy <unk> dollars this is one single peer to peer transaction
we both make a note of it on a ledger
what if i change my entry from <unk> to <unk>
alternatively amy changes hers from <unk> to <unk>
to prevent this trust violation we need to seek the help of people around us lisa allison and francis
provide all of them a valid copy of this ledger
this is the basic concept of an immutable distributed ledger defined in a blockchain process
in this scenario we were all physically present in one location <unk>
now imagine this to be an online transaction
to an unknown peer also scale up the one transaction to <unk> transactions how about a million transactions
i should be able to <unk> with equal ease to any unknown peer in <unk> albany or <unk>
maybe to send some flowers to a friend in <unk> this is the tenant of a decentralized system supported by blockchain
in the case just described how do we trust our unknown peers
through verification and validation in our example amy request kevin to verify the amount i <unk> with her
kevin checks it oops kevin finds that amount transaction is not <unk> but <unk> not valid
kevin rejects and <unk> the transaction similar to this validation when verification methods define by the blockchain
and implemented by the peers provide the collect to trust needed in a decentralized system
summarizing blockchain technology supports methods for a decentralized peer to peer system a collective trust model
and the distributed immutable ledger of records of transactions
i'm back
how's it going guys to everyone at king's <unk> school i hope you're well
i came to king's <unk> school when i was a teenager my name's anthony joshua and i know how tough it is for you guys right now at home i know you're doing your lessons live
i commend you i know it's not easy but your commitment will pay off but it's also important to keep yourself active keep the mind active and keep the body active mister <unk> actually employed me
so i've come down here especially this morning to put in my time and give you a workout plan i was actually taught by mister annette i know he's got a hit class for you guys
so mister annette make sure you warm up you cool down because you're definitely going to be sore tomorrow
but i just wanna say how privileged you guys are to have teachers who care and love and support you ah that are actually on this journey with you it's not only just for you
your brothers your sisters your <unk> your uncles <unk> and dads this is for everyone to get involved and keep active
i may not be the joe wicks of the industry actually tied him up and he's in the corner i'm just joking i'm just joking
this is just something i've come up with something simple straightforward and we're going to progress as the weeks go on so before you pick up your play station or xbox controller
before you pick up your phone and go on social media let's get to work before we start i just wanna say you can do this body weight if you want but someone like me
i prefer to use some equipment around the house so what i have here
it's actually a kings <unk> school bag
pride and honor so i'm gonna take this i'm gonna open it up
and i'm gonna fill it up with some stuff that i've got around the house so for me
as i love boxing i've got my boxing gloves here so i'm gonna shove them in the bag i've got some towels don't tell mum or dad but we're gonna go to the cupboard and get some
coconut milk some peeled tomatoes i wanna zip this up now
as heavy as you want you dictate and we're gonna use this as equipment that we can use to add weight to our workout we're gonna aim to do as many rounds as you can
within ten minutes but it's important to remember your scores so you can come back to it day in and day out and try and improve so get ready to screenshot the workout
so you can try this at home
this exercise is what we call a front squat i want you to keep your back straight your shoulders engaged and i want you to do the movement nice and controlled
and go down as far as you possibly can
that exercise is engaging your legs your quads your <unk> your <unk> your calves and also it's engaging your shoulders so it is a good full body workout
so in this exercise i want you to put the backpack on your back as if you're going to school and we're going to do a press up backpack on my back <unk> are engaged core engaged
shoulders tight and push
so just like the squat it engages the full body it's gonna engage your <unk> it's gonna engage your shoulders your chest it's a <unk> movement
also while you're pushing it's important to keep your core engaged as well so you've got a strong base and also activate your <unk> as well if you can
so this exercise is called a reverse lunge with an overhead press so here we have my equipment here so i've taken a bag in my left hand you can use your right hand
it's up to you what you wanna do but also make sure you use the same side leg to reverse lunge so this is an example here so we stand straight good posture
and i lunge back here but as you can see my knees not touching the ground i want to try and create stability so i'm engaging my core my <unk> my quads
and i'm gonna press up this is causing great instability i'm still engaged as i come down i stand up and that's one
make sure you do both sides
so in this exercise this is what we call a <unk> into a twist so a <unk> is something like this it's like you're rowing a boat so you're down you're up you're down you're up
you're down you're up but we're adding a twist into this so i want you to act as if you're doing a reverse plank
make sure your lower <unk> engaged it's stuck to the floor
you're engaging your <unk> your core and you row the boat and use your piece of equipment your bag with everything in it and you bring over the other side then you go down
hold back up grab your piece of equipment and bring it to the other side not an easy exercise
so you do have the opportunity if you would like to
take out some of these tomatoes
take our pair of boxing gloves make it easy for you you can adjust the weight the choice is yours
and i'm going to use my left hand to drag this bag from my right side oh over to my left
once i've got it over i'm going to put this hand back down i'm going to use my right hand to drag the bag from my left side over
so it's kind of like i'm using my hand to draw an x so from one corner to another over from one corner to another and back over
it's great for engagement in the core it's great to bring your weight down your heart rate up good for lower back pains as well all these exercises can really help
stimulate muscles that you're not using but are really important for stability in your life in your body whether you do this in the morning whether you do in the afternoon or evening try and fit this workout somewhere within the day
i had fun doing that i hope you guys have as well i hope you're feeling rewarded i hope you can track your progression as well so you can note your achievements down i can't wait to catch up with mister fisher
and get to know who's been achieving and how you guys have been getting on and let us know your feedback as well so we can always make room for improvements
so it's time to empty your school bags take your gym equipment out put your school books back in say hello to all the teachers as well make sure you focus on your math and english even if you're a little bit tired the day's nearly done keep up the good work guys and i'll see you soon
from the sign i'm stepping back on my right leg for a double bounce one two and then left
one two one two one two
so essentially what i'm doing here is just switching the <unk> and from the back starting on the right leg for double bounce
one two transfer one two one two
one two from this side back on the right
one two one two one two one two
so just be careful when you're in this position here that you don't have your weight on that front foot because what ends up happening is the step looks like salsa
so we wanna bring the weight back sink down in to the that back leg
so when i take my right leg back my weight comes into my right hip i should be able to lift up that front foot
because all of my weight is in the back leg so with <unk> you always want to imagine like you doing a squat or you're sitting down on a chair
shoulders are back and weight is always backwards so if we start with our right leg that for a double bounce
we don't want to bring the weight forward so back
and back
back
and back
so from the front lets pickup the pace a little more and one two one two one two
see how i am switching the feet <unk> always back switch
switch switch switch let's try from the side so you can see my face
and switch switch double bounce
one two one two from the back right leg back
one two one two one two one two
and to this side right leg back one two one two one two one two one two
one two one two one two okay so that's our basic step
now we are gonna add arms to this step so when i step back on the right leg i'm going to bend my right arm
so from the back stepping back on the right leg bending the right arm
when i step back on the left leg i bend my left arm
right leg right arm left leg left arm
so let's try this from the front back on the right leg bending the right arm back on the left leg bending the left arm
right leg right arm left leg left arm
okay so remember that little tip step back on the right leg with bending the right arm back on the left leg bending the left arm
so now we are gonna add a double bounce to that
so let's start just with four double bounces to get into the rhythm one
and two
and three
and four adding arms
right arm
left arm
right arm
left arm
from the front back on the right so four basic double bounces
think about your posture here shoulder is back tummy in keep bending the knees
let's add arms right leg right arm left leg left arm
good four
three
two
and one
double bounce a little faster let's go and one two one two one two
another four and then we'll add arms three two relax the arms and right arm left arm
right and left right left right and left
so from the front eight double bounces starting back from the right left
start and one two
three four
five six seven get ready for arms right leg right arm right arm left arm
right arm left right left right and left
take a look of <unk> two photos of outer space what do you see they are basically identical but not quite now look a different way in sequence
here you see something different something moving that dot is a newly discovered world it's closer than we ever thought possible
and the trick we used to find it could rewrite the story of our cosmic neighborhood
today scientists have our solar system pretty well mapped out we know about the eight planets pluto moons asteroids comets
and until recently we thought we had a handle on our solar neighborhood too
there is the alpha <unk> system about four light years away and <unk> star a red dwarf a little farther out
astronomers made these discoveries more than one hundred years ago
but today some new work is totally up ending our view of the neighborhood it involves a space telescopes an army of volunteers and a scientist on a very specific mission
my name is jackie <unk> and i'm an astrophysicist at the american museum of natural history
jackie has spent fifteen years searching our solar neighborhood for new neighbors
she's focused on mysterious worlds known as brown dwarfs balls of gas that are too big to be planets but too small to be stars
now they're they're often called failed stars but i really disliked the word failure in the title
because i just feel like it's kind of demeaning to the brown dwarf
it's like it needs to be a star it doesn't care and so often times i call them over excited planets
brown <unk> would be stars if they were more massive but without enough hydrogen they don't achieve nuclear fusion
they emit lots of infrared energy but very little visible light
so for a long time they were hidden to astronomers but that all changed in the nineties
infrared technology and infrared telescopes started to come online in ernest and when that happens you start to see these sky surveys
that are able to produce the wave lengths where you can actually see the brown dwarfs
the first brown dwarfs were i <unk> around nineteen <unk> and since then the field has exploded
today the astronomy community is a washing imagery that could harbor nearby brown dwarfs
actually finding them is another story but there is an old technique called the blink method that works wonders
the basic idea is that all stars are in motion relative to us most are so far away that they move imperceptibly
but objects in our solar neighborhood those are close enough that we can actually catch their movement if we're patient enough
here are four images taken with various telescopes over a span of thirty-two years
if you flip or blink through them you'll see that not everything is staying put
objects of interest that are in the nearby vicinity they will move they will jump against the background of stars
that is <unk> sixteen a pair of brown dwarfs that's only six and a half light years from earth it was discovered using the blink method in <unk>
and it's now the third closest known system to ours
we had not changed that list of objects in the top five in a century it shouldn't happen
we should not be finding objects all of a sudden that are spitting distance away from us that we've been missing all this time
the blink method isn't new <unk> <unk> used it to discover pluto back in <unk> and it's been used to discover moons asteroids and dwarf planets
but paired with new infrared imagery it's slowly bringing our neighborhood into focus a little too slowly really
a few years back jackie found herself staring down millions of images that could contain new discoveries it was daunting
i am spending hours of my time every week blinking images in like my spare time
and i can't ah it's just as frustrating it's taking too much time and i'll never get through all of it
the images are noisy and blurry and each one needed real attention it was far too much for any team to handle
unless that team were hundreds of thousands of people
and so thus sprung our citizen science project
at the beginning my girlfriends ah they didn't understand why i was looking for ah just bunch of moving pixels ah you know for hours
starting in <unk> jackie and her team invited the entire internet to go hunting for brown dwarfs
their system is dead simple users login to a website and meet their first astronomy <unk>
the images come in a sequence of four and will flip and those images flip through time so it shows you what this point in space looked like
ah in this year and then a little bit after then a little bit after then a little bit after
you kind of see blue and orange dots typically that are everywhere
it looks like you are staring at colorful television static
it can be kind of annoying at first if you don't quite know what you are looking for
but if you are lucky you'll catch a mover
when you finally find something moving it's a bit of a ah adrenaline rush
faster moving objects actually do blink across the screen slower ones might just twinkle
they are basically these little tiny like white dots um that will flash when you play our <unk>
either way you can mark your anomaly and alert the community
i think i found something and everyone else kind of is like yeah yeah that's ones like oh yes i'm good i found something
the most promising leads end up on <unk> radar her team can then book telescope time to look more closely for you citizen scientists it's back to blinking
it like ah in a word it's like a treasure hunt ah in your couch it's it's really something that keeps you ah hooked
since backyard worlds launched volunteers have been on a tear
they've discovered hundreds hundreds of nearby objects
somewhere a novel kind of compact frozen world
prior to backyard worlds ah there was only twenty-four of them known they added five new ones
others had surprising new atmospheres
really strange looking objects
and still others were hidden siblings of known objects
i had certainly studied the brown dwarf in the system a lot in previous work and never did i guess that it had a little cold companion with it
all in hundreds of thousands of users have found more than fifteen hundred new objects
volunteers like dan and <unk> have gotten credits in academic papers for their discoveries
there's still more to find jackie thinks the efforts could reveal a brown dwarf even closer than alpha <unk>
a new next door neighbor there's even a chance we could find the bigfoot of our solar system planet nine
there is an object that's theorized to exist beyond pluto that is massive that it could be causing some objects in the outer solar system to be bumped around a bit
ah and it's it's an exciting prospect now does it exist i don't know i am happy that we have citizens that are very interested in are trying to find it
if it's real if it's there and maybe it is
as successful as the blink method is it has competition artificial intelligence has been huge for astronomers who need to sift through tons of imagery including jackie
the human eye is beautiful at picking out things
it's just slow because we have to go image by image and so the human eye wins and in some ways but a i wins in speed so i use both
one limitation of a i is that it needs to train using examples of things that it's looking for so if that thing is brand new human brains have the edge
you are the trained algorithm at that point
that said astronomy is facing a tidal wave of data
in a couple of years astronomers will began imaging the entire night sky of the southern hemisphere twice a week
there is no way we are looking through all of the data in the classic ways in the coming future it like it's over
for now jackie will take all the help she can get from human volunteers to algorithms the humans are more enthusiastic about it
yeah you spend countless hours pouring through images and designing custom algorithms and services and you get something great
it's super exciting to see that all the of this work that we put in are has an impact
you can say to yourself yeah it's a it's something i i saw
and i'm the first human being to in the all history of mankind to to see it it's a it's a great feeling
thank you to <unk> for their support be sure to check out the new <unk> i s by going to <unk> dot com slash i s
their campaign is about going all in on your passion and getting a greater reward which is why they sponsor this series on researchers and innovators
they don't influence our editorial but they do helped make videos like this viable so thanks again to them and thank you for watching
so ah what should and how shall i begin this is the <unk> for the course
the of that's been in there yo catalogue for a long time this is the course and ah finance
it has the world markets in the name ah which suggests that's it's about trading
ah
but i think it's a broad course in fine finance
ah so the the <unk> says financial institutions are a pillar of civilized society
directing resources across space and time to their best uses so this sounds broader i guess the course is broader
i wrote the title of the course many years ago ah when i created this course
and it's been a title for ah but
ah see what really it is to me this course is about is how we get things done in our society
that's how we incentivize people ah to do things now most of us are in our lives thinking about ourselves
that's human nature and about our particular
place in life cycles so ah you may be a young person who's thinking about getting started in life
ah so when you join a enterprise or an organization ah you have to do things for the organization
and you have to take a different perspective
ah you have to help manage a productive venture that involves many people so there aren't that many things that you can do as an individual
that are useful you have to join an organization this is a fundamental principle of human life
ah so this is a course about understanding how how the institutions work ah and how ah we can predict what will happen
and ah things are rapidly changing in the information age that we live in now
that's what this course is about ah i don't consider well i don't consider this a vocational course
ah because i think it's should be of interest to anybody ah who in who is interested in how things work
on the other hand this course
comes across as more of vocational than most yale courses and it sometimes i pride myself on that
although i consider myself an intellectual but ah this is a relevant course alright it's not about how to make money
ah or would you might say it is i suppose but ah it's about making things work
these are the topics ah in this course ah so ah risk insurance <unk> history of finance innovation efficient market behaviour of finance
actually behavior of finance is a little bit more prominent than you might think from its appearance as number seven on this list
ah behavior of finance is the application of psychology sociology other social sciences to understanding financial events
it's a revolution in finance that i have watched over the whole course of it because i have ah organize conferences on behavior of finance
starting in nineteen <unk> working with ah richard taylor at university of chicago and ah
we just ah we've been doing that for twenty-five years but we just ah decreased that there are regular seminars of professors
ah to ah nick <unk> here at the yale school of management
ah but we'll talk about it because i kind of believe in a unity of knowledge
and i ah so this course will differ from many other finance courses and i i wanna talk about real people and how things really work
ah
then we're talking about debt the stock market the real estate market regulation oh by the way regulation is an interest of mine too
ah more so than most people who teach finance because i think that the markets need to be regulated
human beings have a tendency to be manipulative and tricky and finance is used to trick people
ah that's why we need regulators so you shouldn't assume that i want to send you off to wall street
ah i think that you might go to be a member of the great like the securities and exchange commission or something else as a job
and be proud of it okay it's important um
then banking <unk> <unk> market has a special meaning in finance
ah monetary policy endowment management investment banking option money managers exchanges public finance
non profits and finally the that last lecture will be on purpose of all this
ah so that's this course
so ah i wanted also to ah just reflect and the relative i said this course looks more vocational
in a way but i don't consider this vocational school this is
i like to say useful ah
of one one thought i perspective i wanted to give you was how important is finance anyway now you you unless you go into academia
you'll get a job somewhere in the real world ah so where are the jobs
well i i looked up on the ah bureau of labour statistics who is a publication of the in u s government on their website
they have data on just how many people are in different professions in the united states
and they also have a forecast so what i'm showing the latest data is for the year twenty fourteen
ah and it has the number of people in thousands ah and then also on there we have the ah projection for twenty twenty-four
so ah you know there at the top i've got finance professions this is specific finance profession not all finance professions
final financial analysts a financial managers personal financial advisors
they all have hundreds of thousands of people but i wanted you to know what about the other majors that you have here at yale i'm not diminishing them
but ah economics ah economists ah not so many
but you might also be interested in astronomy i actually love astronomy ah ah when i was a kid i thought i'd be an astronomer
but i i had to read reach reality there's lots of exciting fields
where there are almost no jobs so there is how many astronomers are there
ah sociologists political scientists or mathematicians this is not to diminish your <unk> in those fields
for you just don't expect to get a job in those fields
ah i also put down at about massage therapist okay i didn't know that was a profession
but there is ah projected to be about two hundred thousand massage therapists in the united states ah in twenty twenty-four
so we don't have a massage therapy ah ah major here
but ah that's a sign of a of ah
how the market makes things important
now <unk> <unk> might be right about this there's something wrong with having so many finance people maybe we need more massage therapists
and not finance people ah
but there's a sense of reality that i i think that
part of the reason that there's so many of them is that they deal with important issues that can't be quickly um
it can't be more easily solve we need we need all these people that's why i take some pride in this course in being connected to the real world
there are real job opportunities in finance and there are also i think in the new industrial revolution period
they will still be i think this is one of the fields that ah is not going to be
totally replace by computer the problem with finance is the is the is a high inequality in these in these ah ah in this field
some people ah make a lot of money but on the other hand you have to give it away this is another thing about this course
if you make a lot of money in finance it's a game you enjoyed it now give most of it away that's that's going to be a theme
there're long insecurities route ah only arrive but again of the end
so it's been a battle going on for a long time about the nature of artificial intelligence and what is nature should be
there's two very different approaches they are very different ideologies um one is inspired by logic
and so the other day is in the essence of intelligence is using symbolic rules to manipulate symbolic expressions
and the people who believed this or people who believed it um didn't think this was empirical they thought that's the only way you have intelligence and sort of sort of necessary truth the possible intelligence it gonna be
there's a different set of people um who were equally ideological who believed that if you want to make an intelligence system you should look to biology
and in particularly huge trying understand how to brain with two yet
and it doesn't look as if the brains of animals but doing it by logic of course it's also it's a debate about whether animals are intelligent but um
the biological inspire people followed the essence of intelligence who was learning the connections strengths in the neural network
and you can see these two two completely different world views they they cannot miss each other um
so there's a battle went on for all time in the nineteen sixties we we had very simple neural nets and we had a simple learning output interval
they only had one node features and they were completely wiped out by symbolic element
so when i started in graduate schools in <unk> it was one of my neural network in nonsense they were the past they were never do anything and to be improved they were useless
that's why we start and that's what almost everybody know happening
then in the ninety eighties
um various groups came up with the back propagation feature and none void neural networks to learn <unk> features
so we got over this problem but until then neural networks just had hand design features they waited those features to make a decision and then they made a decision
they didn't learn their own features with back propagation we could learn there's features and there's a lot hype that propagation could solve everything um that's why i believed
that is i believed in the eighties that what's happening a day is gonna happen then and it didn't
in the nineteen nineties
um people shared through other machine learning algorithms so we were better than back propagation on <unk> problems things for support <unk>
they have <unk> map and they worked a little bit better well what we now think of is very small problems things with a few thousands training examples
so neural networks wipe that again
then in about two thousand and six we came up with some technical improvements to neural networks that made them a bit easier to learn
and that was the main point at that time you got more competition and more data and suddenly neural networks with <unk> of laser features work amazingly work
and now google and facebook and microsoft and apple and amazon and all the other high tech companies you can think of individual one ah all betting the pharma neural networks
they believe that's certainly to be the future and the huge demand for students who know anything about neural networks
so the old way to make a computer to do what you wanted which write a program
where you figure it out how you doing yourself and then you explain to the computing exquisite detail how to do what you would have done yourself with a whole lot process
so if i want to consult this representative i would trigger out well i'm not a computer scientist you'll quickly realize
i would figure out well i could go down the list and find the biggest thing and then put that up to top and then i could go down the list again and find the next biggest thing and put that underneath those thing
it's not a good algorithm but i might decide to do it like that and then i could tell the computer to that and then the computer will sort list faster than i could
the new edge to do it is to you first tell the computer to pretend to be a neural network
and then you just show it examples so you showed an example of <unk> list in a sorted list and show lots of example and so you take these things and produce those things
and after while you gets the idea as it you don't have to write a program
sorting list is something this difficult to do this way recognizing objects images is something is much easier to do this way
so here's an example with something we like computers to do and people in classical era tried to this for fifty years and they didn't make much progress
so the idea is to give them the r g b values of hole bunch pixels and you have to convert those to a caption which describes percentage
so you'll need numbers coming in and you have a string of words coming out
and you cannot imagine how you might go about writing a program to that but you can imagine it's gonna be difficult
you first of all would maybe is write a program to find the little pieces of edge in the image or maybe color contrasts
and just do in the vision would be more than you can do it
and then relating through vision to the language will become ranges now what we can do is we can solve that problem just by using machine learning
um with hardly any hand program
and by the end of the lecture you'll understand how could you do that
okay is that louder good okay i think the mic is turned on and
so i'm to going explain many of you have this already but i'm explaining more hard before you all miss it's a little computational advice
that's a little bit like <unk> but not very it takes some inputs coming typically from other neurons has weights on the connections
it takes the inputs times the weight has it up by statistical input and then it puts it through a non area function
but non functional will work there is when we list to use that and that's exactly
so basically that non linear function simply says if you've got a lot of input and give a lot of output and if your inputs below a threshold don't give any output
so it's called a <unk> linear
and the question is if you look together about to those guys then you figure out a way to make those weights on the connection at the time what can you do with it
so we took the helping together by making multiple layers this again is sort of neural inspired and if you look at about to line up neural network like that
the layers in the middle it's hard to figure out what the way it should be when you'll adapt those ways in effect you decide more features
they know is in the middle layer you should detect so the problem detecting is basically a problem deciding what individual features do you want in the same problem
now i'm show you a way of learning those features um but ah really stupid
of the devil of you work um we're going to give it inputs and we're going to tell it what the right answer is
and then we gonna adapt away it's one ratio time
so the suppose you want someone you can tell the difference in pictures of cats and pictures of dogs we give it two out that's one of the cat one of the dog
and if you show it a cat on the output for <unk> side in the output for cat that's bad um so we can share a bunch of pictures and measure how what it's doing
and then we can pick one of the ways in the network and we can change the value of that weight
and we can see if the network is doing better or worse than it was before to see that you need to show a bunch of examples
um if the change worked we keep it then we look again another way
now i think you can see that that algorithm is gonna have to show a bunch of examples for each weight and if you got a billion weights it's gonna be extremely slow
but that's what we want to do we only change weights in the direction that makes him help that's all we're trying to do we are just trying to do that efficiently
and back propagation which many of you know but i'm not gonna explain that
it's just the efficient way of computing how to change the weights in the direction that will help reduce the discrepancy between what the network and what you'd like to write
and the big difference is that if you <unk> the weights you measures the effects of a change plays on the network
well in back propagation you compute the effects so if you know always in the network you don't have to measure you can compute
when you compute you can compute for always at the same time what direction we should change them to help
you can't do that when you're measuring you have to change the one for time um
so measure so computing is not for artificial measuring evolution can't do the same measuring and can't do the same computing algorithm cause evolution will change a gene
and then there's a whole developmental process in the environment and you don't know unless you can back propagate through
so what evolution did was it came up with the brains so that it could be back propagation as much they
so back propagation you go forced through these layers you compare with back propagation you back probably at signals that realize you to compute each way what direction change it in to make it work better
and we thought in the eighties that was problem solving we command on lots of those but it didn't work very well
and we didn't know why it didn't work most people thought it didn't work because this is a stupid idea that is the idea that you would take a network with random ways
and you just showed a work data and there's a lot of thing this data be able to design on its own feature detectors
and do very good performance of things like machine translation or recognizing objects and images or recognizing speech
almost everybody know hang on so far idea was completely crazy um a few of us didn't a few of us just thought we didn't know why it's not working
it's obviously the right thing to do and we discovered later the reason wasn't working was was computers which is learn data in not minimum
um if you take that in the eighties people would said oh yeah sure if you have bigger computer and more data it will work but look it doesn't work um it turned out that is right
among we got a bigger computer and more data it worked now there is in technical things too but it was mainly the increasing computer speed and data size that matter
so i'm gonna show you a couple of examples before i get back to you show what function is um
the example that premier the most impact is in two thousand and twelve there was a big public competition where you have a thousand different types of object and a million training images
and you have to learn to recognize the different types of object and there's a a secret test set um so you can't you know test that
and it's can't do this right if you get the correct pause in your top five bets because it's not play what the right bet is for someone
for example you have a image which has a <unk> in the board of chairs and same <unk> the same chair is one of those is right and if you say both you can't get it right
so we look the best existing computer vision methods we used and the results look like this
um results of the top where we are now um results below
two of my graduate students in university of toronto ah managed to get sixteen percent
and then the best computer vision groups um were getting more than twenty-five percent work
so we almost have the average and that kind of huge impact on computer vision almost overnight that is within the year
um all living people change from um doing handles chew things doing what they were doing before to do in your own nets
and so in two thousand and eleven if you send a paper using your instant computer vision conference it would be rejected because it was using neural nets
and by two thousand and fifteen if you send a paper to computer vision conference it will be rejected if it wasn't using neural nets it is a little bit of change
okay it was obvious if two grad students can beat the best computer vision research as if you're doing this stuff for thousand years then you're gonna develop more further
and the thing is did by two thousand and fifteen the error rate on engineering was seventy-five percent which is about the human error right and now it's down to three percent you can see the credibility there
so i'll just use show you some examples that kind of work in computer vision
so there's an image and the right answer is <unk> and if you look at the what the <unk> x says it's very confident the <unk> is the right answer
and it has a few of other things the things are totally out of the question like leopard and snow leopard and egyptian cat so put it all its back up on this is a very sensible answers
and if is that's not a sort of typically legitimate <unk> half the heads missing and it's a <unk> pose up right
it's not a sort of classic it's not the diagram we make of a <unk> to say shows on me what a <unk> is
here's a bullet train and your lashes the bullet train probably occupies less than ten percent of the pixels the building in the background is much bigger
there's a platform there's a person on the platform pretty sort of knows what the right hands is likely to be cause i'm just talk about the focus of images
and you put the thing you want to attend to in the middle and all this in terms of answers is practice <unk>
he's got might a guess as well
so the correct answer is hand glass
he thinks the best answer is scissors and you can sort of seem like using scissors um you can see better why i might think try with that
it it doesn't understand that that thing that i think must be in chain is in the handle of a frame pack basically it needs glasses and um
you'll see what i say step this code and the important thing here is that all the wrong answers are visually plausible wrong answers
to give you an idea of the understands of lot about what things look like
okay so that i huge spectral computer vision and then a few years later
um some very great people including <unk> <unk> who is one of the people with the um in two thousand and twelve image that system um
decided that try neural nets on machine translation a machine translation attribute the perfect problem for symbolic era
so people in symbolic era i mean we all agree that symbols come in and symbols come out okay
the question is what's in between is it just more symbols
so the classic a i view is symbols come in what's inside is sort of like symbols it's sort of cleaned up symbols
i mean symbolic expressions and you do <unk> on symbolic expressions and then another symbol string comes out so it's from of symbols
the biological view would be symbols come in there the way we code things to go over communication channel
and resist noise nicely once the symbols are come in they get converted to things that are nothing like those symbols
so the point about a symbol is it only has basically one property a symbol either is always not identical to another symbol
we take two different symbols the only property that matters are they the same symbol
okay all the other properties are just
of too far through the symbol that are not relevant to the process
in neural nets what happens it's a symbol comes in and it gets converted into a greatly vector that has all sorts of features
that capture lots of knowledge about the meaning of that word
and words that mean similar things but don't look similar like friday and wednesday
they mean pretty similar things that distinct symbols
there's nothing well there's that more few week structure of day so that's bad example but but basically um that
that distinct symbols and that's all the symbol processing system knows in a neural net it learns that wednesday and friday are very very similar things we will see that later
so the symbolic era approaching machine translation is to say okay a simple stream comes in english
we'll do some <unk> using rules and that we're clearly gonna use rules of grammar we will also be used semantic rules that somehow do composition or semantic
that is given what the individual pieces mean they figure out what a group of pieces must mean um and then we're going to produce symbols coming out
and we're gonna use all the knowledge that linguist have about how language works
the neural network approach now even i thought this was a bit crazy and bit ambitious
um is to say let's just take a whole bunch of translations pairs of english sentences and french sentences
and we'll stick in the english sentence one word in a time and then we're going to our our current neural network we shall explain in a minute what cycles around its inside
and after we finish sticking the english sentence that will carry a neural network we'll have some particular state of activity and we're cool about a thought vector
and that's what i thought is is the state about activity than the neural net after the english sentence
and you'll notice if you think about how the word fault works in english i could say john
well i'll tell you a couple of strange things that that the things that i don't really understand the first is when we've done the analysis of the effects of the future <unk> program
it has had a different differential impact on men
and it's had a particularly differential impact on what i would call excluded men
and so that would be <unk> ethnic minority men or or but
majority men who are doing very well so for example at <unk> college
the future <unk> program had a particularly robust effect on <unk> college students who were men who hadn't done very well in high school and who hadn't pick picked a major
that had a destination a career destination at its end
so you can imagine those peoples are they have ambiguous relationship with the idea of education
and they are not oriented specifically towards a goal they're not very motivated
now why did it have a differential effect on men that's a good question
well first of all the women are doing well
so it might just be a matter of the effect that it does better for people who aren't doing as well and at the moment most of them are men
i don't believe i think that might be part of it but i don't believe that's all of it
i think that part of the reason that women are doing better is cause they're agreeable and so if a system sets out a structure and says here's a pathway to attainment
the women won't rebel against that they'll go along with it and that's working very well for them at the moment
the men especially the men on the disagreeable end of the distribution and there is way more men on the <unk> disagreeable end of the distribution than there are women
like that's what you get from if you look at overlapping normal distributions so there is the male <unk> female distribution for <unk>
male distribution for <unk> tremendous overlap
women are higher all the really agreeable people are women all the really disagreeable people are men and maybe the real differences occur at the extremes right so
so in it's it's very interesting side effect of overlapping distributions so they people can be mostly the same but that can still produce radical differences
disagreeable men won't do anything they don't wanna do
they just say appears i'll go home and play video games he was in i'm not listening to your stupid classes and why should i work for you i will just go have fun
i'll do my own thing i don't think they're motivated and so then if you take the men who are right that and you say okay what do you want
you can have what you want but you have to figure out what it is so then they write down what they want if they go oh hey well that might be worth having so maybe i'll put some effort into it
that's what it looks like to me now you know that's weak evidence and this is a weak argument but i'm trying to stretch out my understanding to account for this but i tell you something else that's really weird
i don't understand this either so
more than ninety percent of the people who watch my videos on youtube are men now that's weird because not above eighty percent of psychology students are women
so that is not what you would expect right you would expect that the ma ma majority of them would be women and you might say well it's because of the political stance i've taken
my thought well that's possible so i went and looked at the demographic data because i have that well before i did any of the political videos <unk> percent of my viewers were men
so it's actually increased a bit it's increased by six percent and that's not trivial but it was still overwhelmingly men
so that was interesting i thought what the hell why is that exactly and then now i have been watching crowds when i have been talking to them and the crowds that they have come to see in person
this happened at the university of toronto free speech debate and i actually noticed it and commented on it before the debate took place because i was talking about intrinsic differences between men and women
and i looked around the room and i thought <unk> hey eighty percent of the people in this room are men so i had all the man women stand up and then all men stand up i said look like
here is a natural experiment for some reason eighty percent of the people who showed up to this are men now everybody thought i was kinda cracked to do to do that
and it was a risk you know what and and i but i thought no there's something going on here and then what's interesting now is that every public appearance that i've made
that's related to the sort of topics that we're discussing is overwhelmingly men it's like it's like <unk> to ninety percent
and so i thought wow that's weird like what they hell is going on here exactly and then the other thing i've noticed is that
i've been talking a lot to the crowds that i've been talking to not about rights but about responsibility right
because you can have the bloody <unk> what are you doing you can't have the conversation about rights without the conversation about responsibility because
your rights are my responsibility that's what they are technically so you just can't have only half of that discussion
and we're only having half that discussion the question is what the hell are you leaving out if you only have that half of the discussion
and the answer is why you leaving up responsibility and then the question is for what are you leaving out if you leaving up the responsibility and the answer might be or maybe you leaving out the meaning of life
that's what it looks like to me it's like here you are suffering away what makes it worth while rights
you know you are completely out you are completely you have no idea what your ah you it's almost impossible to describe how bad an idea that is
responsibility
password gives life meaning it's like lift a load then you can tolerate yourself right cause look at you useless easily hurt
easily killed why should you have any self respect that's the the story of the fall pick something up and carry it pick make it heavy enough so that you can think
yeah well useless as i am at least i could move that from there to there well what's really cool about that is that when i talk to these crowds about this
the men's eyes light up that's very like i have seen that phenomenon because i've been talking about this mythological material for a long time and i can see when i'm watching crowds people you know their eyebrows lift
their eyes lie light up because i put something together for them that's what mythological stories do so i'm not taking responsibility for that that's what the stories do
so i say the story and people go click click click you know and their eyes light up but this responsibility thing that's a whole new order of this is that young men are so hungry for that
it is unbelievable and one of the things i have been talking to some of the people who'd be um running for the conservative leadership in canada and i've been talking to them about
well the difficulties they have is communicating with young people because conservatives what what the hell are they gonna sell to young people right cause being conservative is something that happens when you're older they can sell responsibility
no one's selling it and the thing is for men there is nothing but responsibility you know i was watching the simpsons the other day i watched the first <unk> episode and
and i <unk> it
and so it's really interesting so what happens in the first simpson's episode is that it's christmas and homer and marge are going to buy some christmas presents but homer doesn't get his christmas bonus
and so he's absolutely crushed by that and that actually is a recurring theme in the simpson's where homer loses his job or something like that or can't like make enough money
he's completely crushed even though he's kind of useless <unk> laughing fool of a guy you know
the the thing that gives that show it's soul is that he is still oriented towards his family that's what makes him honorable is that foolish as he is
he's decided to adopt responsibility for his family and to try to bear that and so he's not he's a holy fool he's not a complete fool
and it's so interesting watching the story because he suffers dreadfully as a consequence of not being able to fulfill his responsibility well that's for men
women have their sense of responsibilities they're not the same right because of their complicated because women of course have to take primary responsibility
for for having infants at least but then also for caring for them they're they're structured differently then men
pro biological necessity even if it's not a psychological issue and it's also partly a psychological issue women know what they have to do men have to figure out what they have to do
and if they have nothing worth living for then they stay <unk>
and why the hell not
because the alternative to valued responsibility is
impulsive low class pleasure and you saw that in the pinocchio story right that's a pleasure island it's like well why lift a load if there's nothing in it for you
that's another thing we're doing to men that's a very bad idea and to boys it's like
you're pathological and oppressive it's like fine then why the hell am i gonna play if that's the if that's the situation if i get no credit for bearing responsibility
could bloody well be sure i'm not gonna bear any but then you know your life is useless and meaningless yeah you're not you're full of self contempt and <unk> and
and that's not good and so that's why i think i that's what i think is going on at a deeper level with regards to men needing this direction
a man has to decide that he's going to do something he has to decide that
yeah well you know partly what you're trying to do in the future offering process is to say okay well what's your highest value right it's the star it's like okay what are you aiming for
you can decide man but you know there's some criteria it should be good for you it should be good for you in a way that <unk> you moving forward
maybe it should be good for you in a way that's also good for the family and the community it should cover the the domain of life
i mean there's constraints on what you should regard as a value but you but within those constraints you have the
choice you have choice well the thing is that is people will carry a heavy load if they get to pick the god damn load
so and they think well i won't carry any load it's like okay fine but then you're like this sled dog that doesn't have a sled to pull you're just gonna
you're gonna tear pieces out of your own legs because you're bored you know you need people are pack animals they need they need to pull against a weight
and and that's not true for everyone it's not true particularly say for low consciousness people i mean maybe they're open and creative or <unk> or some other things
but for the for the typical person
they they they'll eat themselves they'll eat themselves up unless they have a low this is why there's such an opiate at epidemic among ah <unk> white middle-aged guys
who are unemployed in the u s it's like they lose their job they're done
right they despise themselves they develop chronic pain <unk> and depression and the chronic pain is treated with opiate it's like that's what we're doing so
yeah that's what it looks like to me is you you have to and it's so interesting to watch the young men when you talk to them about responsibility they're so god damn thrilled about it
it just blows me away it's like really
that's what's that's the counter culture
grow the hell up and do something useful really i could do that oh i'm so excited by that idea no one ever mentioned that before
it's like right right right right jesus it's it's it's a polling it's it's and and i feel that's deeply felt by the people
who are who are coming out to to listen to these sorts of things too there they've had enough of that
so and they better have because it's it's a <unk> motive being responsibility man that's where the meaning in life is so
now it's my privilege to introduce andrew <unk> he's co-founder and chairman of the board of coursera
he's an adjunct professor in the computer science department at stanford university
and ah as i think everybody knows in twenty eleven he lead the development of <unk> massive open online course platform a mooc
and taught an online machine learning class that was offered to over a <unk> students that was the initiative that led to the <unk> of coursera
he was also the founding lead of the google brain team which helped google become a leading a i company as well as the former chief scientist at <unk>
where he led the company's a i strategy and execution he's authored or co-authored two hundred research papers in machine learning robotics and related fields
in twenty thirteen he was named in the time hundred list the most influential people he holds degrees from carnegie mellon university oops
carnegie mellon university sorry folks m i t and the university of california berkeley
and perhaps what's the most interesting to me personally about andrew is that he teaches eleven coursera courses
and he has taught over three point four million learners that's a lot of people
welcome andrew
thanks betty um and thanks everyone for joining us but sticking with us to the end of this conference
ah i was browsing through the attendees names and <unk> that we can't be hanging out in person together
um but all the i've attended every coursera upon these conference since the first one and this is the largest one with ever held so that that that's a that's a silver lining
so that um let me share my slides
so hopefully you can see this
um
listening to all of the presentations from earlier today i feel that
because of the rise of covid um
there's not full control of our higher education
society is crying out to ask for help and we as a community have the capability to help a lot of people maybe not everyone but a lot of people
and the choices we make in this community in higher education community the choices we make over the next era will stay with us for decades to come
the online education movement has been <unk> for a decade or maybe many decades
ah as some you know about the starting of coursera where we had started with two courses at the stanford the machine learning class that i taught daily basis class
taught by my friend <unk> <unk>
and in the not quite decade since then the number of courses has grown from two to ah over four thousand on coursera and then launch a number grow one
so this has been growing for a long time and all of you our community has been learning to figure out how to teach online
um
and covid accelerating everything
we've seen how many workers are hit by covid ah especially the ones with without the degree
we have seen um how more people are taking online courses to help deal with self isolation also learn about public health
covid is also treating unique challenges on institutions ah washington coast new york times reported college students <unk> against school tuition after classes move online
and i was gratified when i heard ah <unk> in the panel just now talk about lower pricing announcing lower pricing for this summer session
so many of the trends that happen underway are accelerated by covid ah we all know that society is hurting
the i m f estimates that the world will experience a worst recession since the great depression
ah most of us many of us that live through the global financial crisis of two thousand nine where the global economy um shrunk by point one percent
this time round it will shrink much more by i m f estimates and just in u s alone twenty-two million unemployed in a matter of weeks
and people people are hurting
we have a big role to play to help many of these people
and
<unk> trend on trend trust in expertise and trust in institutions has also been going down not just for the past few months but but for many years now
ah <unk> carries out a ah large annual very large <unk> survey called the <unk> trust <unk>
and um they wanted me to study as they plot
different institutions according to how competent they are viewed and how ethical they are viewed
so the horizontal axis is how competent is an institution vertical axis is how ethical is an institution
um and businesses are viewed as quite competent but not always the most ethical on average
um n g <unk> <unk> organizations are viewed as relatively ethical but not as competent
and government media are perceived by citizens all round the world as it's neither <unk> competent nor ethical
i'm not saying that any of these perceptions are fair um i think there are plenty of highly competent and highly ethical individuals in all of these institutions
but this is a perception of large swath of society and we have a lack of institutions that broadly perceived um
fairly or unfairly well that lack of institutions ah broadly perceive as both highly competent and highly ethical
i would quite like for our institutions of education not institutions of higher education to be able to play that role
ah this trust <unk> did not have a note specifically on higher education but we've all seen the trends ah as as educators for for for many years now
and so maybe there's no surprise therefore that with the rise of covid with all of these impacts um higher education is in crisis
you've seen just in the last few recent period of the time articles with titles like crisis in higher education or in my home state at california california's higher education crisis
or crisis of higher american higher education and so on on and on and on we've seen articles like these
oh and did i say that this is a set created by the covid crisis actually these articles have published ah well before the covid crisis
so it's strange and interesting that the field of higher education has been in crisis for about a decade now
um i think covid is accelerating this crisis but if we were already in this state even before ah the recent pandemic
i think this is even more troubling now you know there there is i i i'm proud to be an educator it's all about discipline very committed to education
but i would quite liked do something so that maybe by the year twenty twenty-five we can all work really hard for a few years and and not be in crisis
ah anymore a few years from now it does seem like the <unk> day for our industry to be at the happening crisis that's a long
um but to me i think this popular reflection of of the state of crisis is is maybe a sign that
despite all the very positive contributions that we have and we're striving to to to make that that's a potential for us to do even better
one of the documents that moved me the most um is the ah universal declaration of human rights
i had first read this document when i was a young assistant professors and then and it really moved me the first time i read this
ah we closing from article <unk> um it says we we we as a society declared in nineteen forty-eight
ah that was the year my father was born <unk> years ago
we society decided that everyone has the right to education
um education free at this elementary and fundamental stages second professional education agenda available
and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit
sadly despite this proud declaration this beautiful declaration that we made as a society <unk> years ago
this still isn't a reality we live in today
and education is limited by geography um by social economical limitations by political restrictions
these restrictions have already been making it hard for students to gain an education and has become even harder just in the past few weeks
um just last night the united states president tweeted out about <unk> immigration ah to united states
and i i have no idea how this will affect many of our students that have been or are counting on maybe coming to the united states
um for their for their studies
and and even simone and outside united states ah simone from imperial on the panel mentioned just now people finding it hard to get to london
this is true not just in united states and in u k but all around the world and covid is accelerating travel restrictions like crazy
i think that's all of us to use additional ran to make sure that education becomes more rather than less accessible
now in this all of this ah doom and gloom i mean is all of these challenges we faced there is a massive silver lining
um i think silver lining is that there's great acceptance of the virtual world of online education
and we're also really lucky that we work in an industry sector than in education a lot of our work can move online
not all of it not easily but a lot of our work can move online
so as an educator i feel special responsibility for us to lead this change and to play the role that all of us
that all of you can play to help the rest of society
and part of the silver lining is that even with everything going on around the world
i see that people want to feel empowered um despite the unemployment despite the uncertainty around the world
people wake up in the morning wanting to help productive quarantine mornings and afternoons and evenings um and
jeff showed this picture of of a rapid rise in new user <unk> and this is not a short term trend they'll be over when covid dies now
this drove in online education has been a long term trend but only accelerated by covid
and you know what with these millions of learners all round the world learning new habits they teaching themselves how to learn online
i feel like as a as an instructor i've been teaching ah my stanford classes online by zoom
ah just as i had to learn new skills our students our learners are having to learn new skills to succeed in learning online
and hopefully ah more countries will emerge from lockdown soon but even when can all <unk> our campuses
ah when social distancing can be ah relaxed
the skills that these millions or tens of millions or hundreds of millions of online learners are learning right now they won't forget these skills
and this creates an opportunity for us to keep on using the digital medium to keep on serving them even after covid is over
i like this quote by ah one of the partners at <unk> who said that the virus seems like an accelerator for additional change that was already underway
and that this digital mindset will persist and it's highly unlikely that companies or universities or students will try to return to one world prior to the pandemic
um patrick brothers during panel also said that what might happen what we preserve previously thought might happen over the next ten years
will now maybe happen over the next two years
and this always change i feel like um digital pedagogy is still in fancy
you know i've been teaching online for a long time ah in the project coursera for the videos of youtube running a lot experiments many which when frankly when when nowhere but
ah even today i feel that online pedagogy the way we would teach online with interactive learners it still isn't infancy
i've been teaching my ah on campus i guess my stanford class using flipped classroom for many years now
um with online digital content auto grading and recently like everyone knows had to move the live portion of that class to zoom
and i've really enjoyed and and on one time i missed the deeper you know emotional connection with learners
and see people out in university and getting to shake hands after class
ah but on the flip side i've really enjoyed interacting with my students in real time live chats
ah previously when i ask the question in class one person you know will will get the answer
now i routinely ask questions in zoom chat and ask every single student in the class to answer
and i really like that everyone in my classroom ah digital classroom now gets to participate
and even though the world's been doing been participating in online education for a long time you know
eight years coursera maybe many decades as a society there is still so much more we can do
you heard ken ah talk about peer grading using machine learning
i'm really excited about the coursera labs for our project guided guided project work features that normally talks about ah <unk> and um ah the talk about many new product features
and when i look at where online education is now and how much better we can make the experience still in the future
i think there's still so much to do and i'm very confident that five years from now we look back at this incredibly rudimentary things we're doing back in twenty twenty and say
wow those things we thought were so advanced in twenty twenty boy that was that was so ancient and so arcade
and we can deliver such a better live experience to our learner right now
and you know i saw we we saw in our newspaper articles about the ah shortage of jigsaw puzzles
ah you know because of ah social distancing at <unk> place the world doesn't have enough jigsaw puzzles and you know may making new jigsaw puzzles is really hard it's really complicated
um but the nice thing about what we can do teaching online is
um if if we have digital jigsaw puzzles the software apps of digital puzzles that can be replicated out still very quickly so
additional innovations one of the things that as we innovate as we come up new forms of pedagogy our community all of you the teachers represented here
um we can quickly take those ideas and replicate that to learn this all round the world because the digital medium is easy to scale up
so with all of the challenges we face and with all of the opportunities
i think we come back to this fork in the road
um we do face significant the the the world face significant challenges
ah ted talks about from universities maybe at a higher risk of closure and
the challenges that society faced and the challenges that all of us in higher education face is creating a fork on the road
where on one hand we could keep on doing businesses as usual
and maybe some of institution will be okay if we do it very robust some very robust institutions with higher education
um and and and maybe we could have instructors teach on zoom but keep a lot of things the same and maybe maybe some of the institutions will do okay
um but i hope that all of us will step up and rethink how we can best be hopeful to the world because
with society in crisis with society reaching us out to us for help with unemployed learners with people needing hope
getting an education because the learning cannot stop um even when people are at home i think it is incumbent on all of us
as leaders in education to step up and rethink how we can help the world
i think this maybe a moment that if we as a community no one of us alone can do this
but if we as a community can rethink how we can use digital tools to serve all of these people so that really willing to accept digital learning
then the opportunity is greater than ever and i hope we can build a world greater world across time zones
and build a world where your education doesn't need a passport
like most work found ever as this will be hard work but everyday um i remain grateful to all of you
to <unk> partners students um on moving forward to build this world
where anyone in the world can have an access to great education
and i like to close um just by thanking all of you again
when we started coursera we had no idea that over the next several years it will blossom to such a large movement
and i am um i am under no illusions that this could not have been done but for the hard work of all of you of of all of our university partners
um and every era education has been in crisis
but in this moment in time that will amaze all of us that will amaze all of you more than ever and i hope that all of us will keep on working hard
and figure out how to use these digital tools to serve learners worldwide when they need this more than ever thank you very much
thank you andrew
heat and drought
rainfall that's grown unpredictable
storms of catastrophic power
and rising sea levels
the forest climate court highlights the impact climate change on humanity
the agreement emphasizes that climate change represents an <unk> and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet
and according to the report of the <unk> panel of climate change africa is the continent that will be most affected by climate change
you may know that <unk> we have ah eight point nine million i d p s
and three point nine million refugees in two thousand nineteen without fully counting two thousand twenty which is a very difficult year
that we have challenged as humanity that that definitely the impact of covid have in all political economical and in in all social aspects
climate change is hitting africa hardest of all although the continent has contributed the least to the crisis
crops are rotting in fields
<unk> can no longer find water for their animals
and the covid nineteen pandemic could soon drive an another forty million people in sub-saharan africa into extreme poverty
so peoples becoming homeless from the extreme weather events and the conflict among the community starts so that's the one who literally migrations
we are talking today many international migrations where there are number of peoples killing themselves into mediterranean to join the europe
but they are the huge numbers of the peoples who are internal displace who have to move from one region to another one
and that create the conflict among those communities who have to share the resources
how can we protect and support those who were displaced
and what the medal ah does its the data has now much more granular data on population explosion which gives the clearer sense of the people who are more likely to be to be displaced by future with rare influence
and it estimates with on average ah we can expect that two point eight million people to be displaced by such <unk> africa during any given withdrawing influence
the optic temperature is more then seven degrees higher than it was one hundred years ago
this has vast implication for example floods tropical storms <unk> around the world
this shows climate change is far more than an environmental issue
it has crucial implications for the economy for peace and stability for security and migration policy
it has therefore become one of the determining factors of foreign policy at large
the impact of climate change is real not last in africa
we are also dealing with the problem of climate apartheid right now so in the sense that the people are of paying first the brutal price
look in a particular color those that historically carried biggest weight of the so so so
yeah often wonder wonder impact urgency will be much more if they were more urgent
immediate impacts happening in europe and so on
now that's a very negative statement to start with let me just tell you why and
basically this is known time for us to be being
having with each other and not talking about the contradiction that are exist and not edge free giving
absolutely serious about <unk> you took the part we are running out of time
development is being <unk> by climate change and we can not ignore it and we've must addressed it and we must address at our front
i believe in saying we have also disrupt scene migration check mega keeping
and this is the key message from my side i think we have to look all concept of migration as a part of solution
most of the time we talk ah basically about the environmental change is the cause for migration and we frame it as a problem
and then rarely look at at these as an opportunity as an <unk> strategy
the european in africa is an <unk> and the african in european is a migrant it can't continue like that
authorities in free town have now determined to plant a million trees by twenty twenty-two
an increase vegetation in the city by fifty percent
that will not only help protect residence in the future but also contribute to the fight against climate change
in addition to this commitments and from the points of view of africa this needs
to focus on buildings resilient societies in which can adapt in place and prosper
so that there isn't need for opportunities migration in this regard
economic development remains one of the most effective ways to increase the capacity to adapt to climate change
you cannot have <unk> resilience we have had economic growth well creation and massive job expansion
and energy of course is tide to everything you need energy for the clean water and sanitation in city
you need energy for the life in to drive industry that will create economic opportunity and growth
so you begin to see that next source between energy water and sanitation energy and health service delivery
there is a real need for urban planning um urban policy um which is aligned to environmental management
ah and and housing stock recognizing this phenomenon of <unk> is here to stay
if you are going to have an influx of people you need to plans to receive them you need to plans to deliver services
i think the continent needs to clarify and to have the clear understanding on where it wants to go what it needs and it how's to do it
it has to be not only top down approach but also bottom up approach fully informed by those needs
should europe turn into even more of a fortress
or should it instead look for more ways to make legal migration from africa possible
climate change is a common threat to all of us no country can withdraw from the affects of global warming
people lose their entire existence because of disasters the political stability of whole regions is at stake
to work together to ease the affect of climate change is therefore a question of humanity that also of political <unk>
this strategy is about the e u and africa joining forces in a solid equal partnership
to make the most of the green and the digital transformation
together we can create decent jobs good livelihoods while also tackling climate change
how can the international community come together to face the immense challenges ahead
for the u n to i written an incredible ah the statutory council needs to change ah composition of security council
ah actually reflects the realities after the second world war but it doesn't the reflect the reality of today
we have to work not <unk> that means we have to work together with light minor countries worth wide to see today
that ah rules based international order is observed this cannot be done just do done by just one country by one person
whether let a crisis go to waste there's a huge opportunity to work on where we can see how to egypt and africa will work together
to address these challenges by shelling best practices shelling experiences and by looking at potential prospects
i think that germany has to do no this is exceptionally my expectation
and i am convinced at climate in use migration isn't issue at urgently need open dialogues
between countries at <unk> platform to create save pass ways for migration
to create a stateless that protect souls who are likely to become stateless
the only failure is to give up its doable we can do it it was done before
the the the key here is to do it differently to do it with with with creativity and to ensure the need of commitment
um ah its about people um we should protect with the hurt of climate action
when it comes to the continent a mobile continent is a hustle continent
when it comes to um when it comes to a mobility a mobile continent is resourceful continent
we always say nature is everything that we have because nature is the one who are giving us food giving us medicine even the medicine in the pharmacy
seventy percent of it is coming from the nature and the nineteen percent from the chemical pest
ah things that they are adding on milk but the aspirations and all the substance is always sounds like coming from nature
and food are coming from nature we have a window of opportunity for now to the next nine years or ten years
to increase all the ambitions and act now if we didn't do that we are going to do this no return to point
it's time to act
good afternoon everybody it is lovely to be back um my name is mabel van <unk> and as you might know i'm ah a former co-chair of ah e c f r and i'm currently a chair emeritus
and i'm really really excited to ah facilitate this conversation with george soros who as you all know is ah the man ah who who played an absolutely crucial role in the creation of e c f r
um and before i hand the floor to him i i wanted to just ah maybe draw attention to one or two of the features that i find so amazing ah of george
um because george ah is somebody who is always ahead of the curve he often sees things long before the general public actually realizes that they are happening
and i am thinking for example about the fact that he recognized the economic crisis of two thousand eight he saw it coming ah before it even hit
um but also i'm thinking about an issue that has really been close to his heart for more than twenty years now i think which is ah criminal justice reform in the united states
and he's been working on twenty for more than twenty years on this and it is really good to see that ah that that is finally getting much more attention as it really deserves
ah um it is closer to home let us get us to europe and one of these things that i've seen george do time and time again in europe is something that also really correct and that is standing up for the underdog
and i saw him first do that in the early nineties when we were working on the war in the balkans but i've seen him do that also for example in the case of the <unk>
and other minorities all over over europe refugees et cetera um so with a man who's always willing to pick a good fight to stand up for what is right and to see ahead
ahead far ah sooner than than many of us can see i'm really really keen to hear from him what is always on his mind and where he thinks
we should all be going george let me give you the floor thank you for being with us
thank you good afternoon everybody
we live in a revolutionary history at times like these the range of possibilities is far greater than in normal times
events that are inconceivable in normal times not only become possible but actually happen
i have developed an con entire conceptual framework based on the thin pillars of <unk> and <unk>
to deal with situations like the present
that's what has allowed me to make a fortune in the financial markets
in the very first days of january of this year i realized that we had entered a global crisis that will change the direction of history
that's when iranian general soleimani was assassinated in iraq
that told me
that countries were more interested in fighting each other than in fighting climate change
as you know climate change is a global problem and it requires global cooperation to bring it under control
then came the novel novel coronavirus that thoroughly disrupted people's lives and added yet another global problem
what direction will history take
that's a question nobody can answer because the future depends on decisions that have not yet been taken
nevertheless i believe my open society foundations are well situated to develop strategies to make the world a better place
i personally ah focused on areas where i have experience and a historical background
that led me to two particularly issues that are of global significance
one is the plan
for the international monetary fund to issue a new round of special drawing rights
and to persuade these countries to learn ah to donate their <unk> which they don't need to poor countries that are desperate for them
to explain the idea better
the special drawing rights are synthetic money created by the i m f
s d <unk> are allocated in accordance with the member countries <unk> in the i m f
rich countries don't need them because they can raise issue money in their own name in the international markets
the capacity of four countries to do so is extremely limited
that's why it's so important for rich countries ah to donate their <unk> to poor ones
as regards historically
i am not sure if we have a technical difficulty whether we have lost george
the connection with george
um i am afraid we have lost the connection with george so hopefully he will he will soon come back in and reconnect
so i please be patient
and i'm sorry as i'm using different technology
there you are george you're george you're back we are <unk>
very good
so nevertheless
enthusiastically endorse the idea and argued that the best and perhaps only way to raise ah one or two trillion euros
is by issuing perpetual bonds
the distinguishing feature of professional bonds is that the principle never has to be repaid only the annual interest is due
this makes them very efficient
they have a <unk> ratio that is almost ten times greater than that of the long-term bonds that the commission is proposing to use
this sounds almost unbelievable but it's true
ah assuming ah o point five percent interest
which is ah quite generous in the currently low interest rate environment
one trillion euros would cost only five billion annually
the interest would have to be forever be paid forever but the present value of future payments <unk> progressively
until it approaches but doesn't quite reach zero
most importantly perpetual bonds could be issued as soon as member states authorize sufficient owned resources
ah to maintain the triple a rating of of the european union
own resources would come from newly authorized taxes such as a tax on carbon emissions
the taxes would only have to be authorized they wouldn't need to be imposed
because that would take too long and speed is the speed is of paramount importance
the perpetual bonds don't need to be issued in one go they could be sold in <unk>
the first <unk> would be snatched up by insurance companies and other long-term investors
who was starved of essence ah to match their <unk>
as the market <unk> themselves with a new instrument other investors would be attracted to it
as as as the bond market ah ah ah as the bonds became actively actively traded
the european central bank would also be allowed to invest in them
there is an important distinction between funds raised from the e u s own resources and those that are contributed by member states
the latter have to be distributed to member states according to their <unk> in the in the european central bank
the former can be given by the commission to those who most in need
that makes all the difference to the effectiveness of of the aid that the european union can provide
for instance
ah it could assist those who have lost their livelihood because of the virus
currently they have to depend on their own governments whose capacities vary
it will be much more equitable if the support came from the european union
ah
i think member states ignore so <unk> an instrument that is ideally suited to the to the current situation
they were aware of perpetual bonds because spain championed them at a virtual summit of the european council on april <unk>
and they were listed as one of the ideas that deserved further consideration
my guess is that the perpetual bonds were dismissed out of hand
because the they were confused with corona bonds
the latter were decisively rejected by member states because some of them were unwilling to go that far
in reality perpetual bonds are the exact opposite of corona bonds
perpetual bonds reduce the debt burden corona bonds increase it
to avoid confusion and i'll try to avoid using that perpetual bonds
i prefer to use the word consoles
that's the name the u k and the u s used for centuries to deserve perpetual to describe perpetual bonds
the u k started in seventeen <unk> and the u s in eighteen in the eighteen seventies
interestingly the netherlands
<unk> the other two countries
and that water board issued perpetual bonds in sixteen forty-eight
to repair a dike
the bonds are still outstanding
but the annual interest has become so small that the general public is not even aware of their continued existence
as far as i know the dutch actually invented the idea
yet today they are the most ah ardent opponent
they are the leaders of the so called <unk> four
in sixteen forty-eight the netherlands faced ah serious threat from flooding
today the combination of the virus and climate change poses an even greater danger to to the european union
if would be tragic if european general and <unk> four in particular failed to give consoles the consideration they deserve
i recognize that there are bound to be the legal objections
based on the t f e u that contains all the rule that govern the european union
i believe the objections could be overcome
by arguing that the authors of the t f e u were not aware of the existence of consoles
therefore ah ah ah ah its regulations ah doesn't apply to them
i also an anticipate
moral objections from german speaking people
the german world assured has a double meaning debt and guilt
it follows that that the debt should be the the that <unk> should be punished
that makes perpetual bonds that never have to be repaid morally <unk>
there is one legitimate legitimate objection that maybe be may raised
once you start using consoles you may end up abusing them
but the fact that the large-scale use of ah euro europe's triple a credit is already designated as a temporary measure
that should be ah ah there ah that should ensure
that they would not be used in nor normal times
they are ah offer a financial tool ideally suited to current circumstances
and they would not be abused in normal circumstances
so why all this hostility
i believe the answer is to be found in the sequence of events
the commission was not aware of professional bonds when it proposed a recovery plan
it was relying on the only instrument over which it had some control namely the budget
that focused the attention of the member states and the interest groups
on how are the funds are distributed not on how they were generated
interested parties are now <unk> with each other
for instance the <unk> four want to protect the their discounts from their contributions to the budget
it is take time for the authorities to realize that the budget can generate the amount of money the european union needs
that's when the consoles will ah will will ah will be recognized
as an indispensable financial instrument
but by that time it may be too late
we must therefore accelerate the process
the the money is needed now
and ah ah she ah has fully recovered her political influence
she also has capable supporters in the ministry of finance
who understand the merits of consoles
in addition to deal ah the dealing with the virus
consoles should also be used to address climate change
recently a strong movement has develop
ah ah to ah raise the <unk> climate target
from forty percent to <unk> percent
a number of mainly east european countries are <unk> that they didn't have enough money to reach the higher target
that could be readily <unk> with additional trillion euros of consoles
of course the commission would have to carefully monitor that the funds are not <unk> and <unk>
in this way the european union could meet the two great challenges o o of of our time
and a fulfilled the expectations of its citizens that will be a truly great accomplishment thank you
there were but few men in the history of humanity who have accumulated fortunes like that of andrew carnegie a man who was as complex as he was rich

carnegie is at one point the richest american in history but he wasn't born in america
<unk> story begins across the atlantic ocean in <unk> scotland where he grew up in what could only be described as abject poverty
his mother would work around the clock sewing shoes his father would make cloth and other material and weaving loom
that was of course until the steam powered loom came into the picture with weaving technology rapidly improving his father's loom business would crumble finding himself crushed by the industrial revolution
watching his father suffer as he begged for work would impact the young carnegie profoundly in eighteen forty-eight the carnegie set out in search of a better life outside scotland after selling all of their possessions and borrowing twenty pounds
the family embarked on their journey to the land of opportunity america they would restart their lives from scratch in pittsburgh the hub of manufacturing but still found themselves unable to escape hardship in their new country
his father and mother both struggled to find work leaving andrew no choice but to drop out of school to support his family he would finally catch a break from the scorching heat of the boiler rooms when he landed a job at a local telegraph office
as a messenger boy he would deliver <unk> by bike all over pittsburgh he would memorize the faces of every one he delivered to so that he could greet them by name if he saw them outside of work
it would provide carnegie with a unique opportunity to <unk> himself with the city's business community at seventeen he would perfect his telegraph skills he would grow increasingly skilled at hearing morse code
impressively he could recite messages without needing to write them down this caught the eye of thomas scott a regional manager for the pennsylvania railroad company who hire carnegie to be his personal <unk>
and private secretary for the sum of thirty five dollars a month at the time the pennsylvania railroad company was the largest corporation in the world
for the business savvy carnegie it was an opportunity like none other a front row seat on how to run a successful business
thomas scott his boss realized <unk> potential and decided to take the boy under his wing mentoring him like a second father
it would later be thomas advice to invest in stocks that provided carnegie with his first taste of capitalism fast forward to the american civil war carnegie is drafted into the union but instead of fighting in the war
carnegie would profit from it he was able to escape <unk> way after paying eight hundred and fifty dollars for a substitute to take his place on the battlefield it was during this time the carnegie noticed that the wooden bridges were easily burned by the troops
and that there was a desperate need for iron bridges to replace them he capitalized on the opportunity launching the keystone bridge company but it would be his next move that would define him as an astute businessman
keystone didn't just build bridges they also had their very own iron mills which provided the iron that was needed for constructing the bridges
owning the iron sauce meant that <unk> bridge building company would not be dependent on mining or extracting companies for iron like their competitors this not only gave carnegie more control over the entire process it also improved their margins
after the bridge was built he would leverage his connections in the railroad industry to make money there too essentially he was operating a <unk> of three companies each strengthening one another
first a mining extraction company second a bridge building company which used the iron provided from a mining company and then once the bridge was built his third business with <unk> by selling rail
the concept worked to a t
always looking for the next big opportunity andrew set his sights on new york city the <unk> business capital of the world in the city he expected to find a <unk> culture and mingled with other distinguished businessman
but what he found instead was disappointment he would describe the wealthy individuals around him as <unk>
carnegie wrote a note to himself promising that in two years when he turned thirty-five he would retire and focus on making the world a better place
but this note would go <unk> in eighteen <unk> a new invention by henry <unk> called the <unk> converter
a pear shaped furnace would allow for the mass production of steel something previously thought to be impossible for the first time ever it would finally become feasible to create large structures from steel
eventually giving birth to the first skyscrapers forever transforming a city <unk> carnegie moved with lightning speed successfully building america's first steel plant
in doing so he hired the best engineers and architects that money could buy he focused <unk> on increasing efficiency always using the latest technology and pushing his employees to their maximum physical and mental capabilities
he was also notorious for requiring employees to work three hundred and <unk> days a year only allowing for rest on the fourth of july
as technology continues to advance he would seek ways to replace his workers with machines at every possible opportunity
unlike man machines didn't need sleep they also didn't ask for raises and they certainly did not try to <unk>
carnegie a master salesman decided to name the venture not carnegie steel but rather j edgar thompson <unk> the name of one of his customers in the railroad industry
carnegie hoped to steel mill named after a customer would show his appreciation for their business and maybe even secure more orders from their railroad and it did the first order from thompson consisted of two thousand steel rails
naming a mill after a customer was more than a sales <unk> it was part of a larger strategy showing appreciation in public for others
acts like this would continue to pay massive dividends throughout the <unk> career to help run carnegie steel mills he would bring on board a cut throat executive known for his <unk> and attention to the bottom line
henry clay frick as a team carnegie and frick were a powerful force to be reckoned with and to show how ruthless the two could be look no farther than the story about <unk> works
with the help of frick carnegie spread a rumor which alleged that <unk> mill was producing defective steel it wasn't true but it didn't matter
carnegie claimed to <unk> railroad customers for their rails liked what he called <unk> few if anyone actually knew what the word meant but that wasn't important
carnegie used the word because it sounded scary enough to frighten off railroads were concerned that they weren't getting good products if <unk> sales slowed they would eventually become <unk> and run out of money
to <unk> their demise carnegie and frick would proceed to undercut <unk> on price further squeezing the company
within two years <unk> finances were in ruins leaving it no other choice than to sell to none other than carnegie at a bargain price
for frick and carnegie rules of engagement were clear do whatever it takes to win but this <unk> came with a <unk> price as they would soon discover at one of their largest steel plants in homestead pennsylvania
carnegie had just invested millions of dollars optimizing the efficiency of homestead and enabling it to produce more steel than any other mill comparable to its size
but there was another part of the profit machine that was yet to be optimized labor costs this posed a problem for carnegie who had been working on <unk> his image from an oppressive steel factory billionaire to a champion of <unk> rights
so instead of risking his reputation he would have his right hand lieutenant henry frick execute the dirty work meanwhile carnegie with distance himself traveling abroad to his home country scotland
carnegie knew that he wouldn't want to be around the plant after cutting wages for ten thousand already frustrated low paid workers
in eighteen ninety two tensions between workers and mill owners are particularly heightened after an ever widening wealth gap continued to grow the richest people in america are accumulating fortunes faster than at any time in american history
meanwhile workers felt that they were property of the rich and the best shrinking voice could only be heard through a union to make things even worse
frick who took his orders from carnegie demanded increased factory production which would mean even more hours <unk> away but to top it all off frick would not be increasing their income
he'd be reducing its longer hours and less pay but homestead at a boiling point the strike is also demanding safer working conditions and for a good reason
in eighteen <unk> nine percent of all steel workers <unk> would die on the job when the workers refused <unk> aggressive demands for longer hours and less pay he decided to lock out all employees
and bringing a substitute group of immigrant workers who would be willing to do that dangerous jobs for less
to escort the immigrant workers as they made their way to the factory frick called on a three hundred person army for hire called the <unk> armed with rifles
they made their way to the factory where they were met by ten thousand angry <unk> refusing to give up what they called home
historians don't know who fired the first gunshot but what we do know is that the day would no longer be called the homestead strike
but rather the homestead massacre by the end of the battle nine factory workers and seven <unk> will be dead
hundreds would be injured the fighting was so extreme that the governor ordered for eight thousand militia troops to provide backup under the protection of the state's troops the factory would be reopened
and unfortunately for <unk> worker they would be returning with lower pay longer working hours and the same safety conditions
another collateral damage from homes that came in the form of <unk> reputation prior to the tragedies have homes that he would often advocating public for better conditions in steel mills and increased wages
but these words were far from a line with his actions hypocrisy was incredibly prevalent while he preached increased wages and improved safety conditions
he was simultaneously reducing labor costs by slashing paychecks and doing little if anything to make his factories a safer place to work
carnegie was widely called a coward for using freak as a scapegoat not only for the tragedy but for all the other dirty work that he didn't want his name to be associated with
but in spite of the tensions and animosity the steel mills continue to thrive in fact by nineteen hundred the company would produce more steel than the entire nation of great britain
but in nineteen o one carnegie grew tired of the game and wanted to spend time with his wife and daughter
<unk> j p morgan was a rising competitor in the steel industry and carnegie now nearing seventy became open to the idea of selling the company he'd spent his entire life building
carnegie wrote on a scrap of paper what he would be willing to accept charles <unk> the president of carnegie steel delivered the offer to morgan
as the story goes j p morgan glanced at the offer and without hesitation accepted it morgan would buy carnegie steel for four hundred and eighty million dollars making carnegie the single richest man in the world at the time
carnegie would completely cut ties with his business life and dedicate one hundred percent of himself to serving the world through philanthropy not a single dollar will be left to his family
because andrew had only five years of schooling he had a soft spot for libraries which he credits for helping him achieve financial success he acquired
over the course of his life he would donate over two and a half thousand libraries the cities all around the world but it wasn't all <unk> he was generous for generosity say his name was only displayed on less than five hundred of those libraries
one example of his generosity is carnegie hall one of new york's most recognizable landmarks built in eighteen <unk> carnegie built and donated the building as the musical hall
but its original name of the music hall was only change to the current version after his death and not by his request but threw the music halls board members and from nineteen o one until his death in nineteen nineteen in <unk> massachusetts
<unk> full time job was giving away the vast wealth he had built up for himself as we mentioned at the beginning of this story carnegie was a man who was as complex as he was rich
did he employ abusive labor techniques to keep his factories producing maximum profit yes was he hypocritical of course did he make up slander to put his competitors out of business absolutely
while these things are all true <unk> philanthropic impact is also equally great perplexing to say the least how can a man commit such sins and then become a saint
perhaps he viewed donating his money as a way to <unk> for his business sins making money is a great feeling but an even better feeling is giving it away if you want to grow wealth and perhaps donate to noble causes like carnegie did

henry ford one of the most influential american <unk> through his company henry transformed american life and in this video we're gonna learn how he did it starting from the very beginning
this video is brought to you by audible and a big part of it is based on henry <unk> biography which you can listen to for free on audible if you register for a free trial with the link in the description
you should also check out real <unk> video on the manufacturing innovations of the assembly line which he explains <unk> on his channel
by all accounts henry ford should've been a farmer born in michigan barely twenty years after it had become a state
henry grew up at a time when farming was slow exhausting and manual which is why unsurprisingly he came to hate it with a passion but whereas most people at the time didn't have the fortune to escape what they were born into
henry was lucky enough to get such an opportunity you see the village he was born in was just eight miles west of detroit which was rapidly becoming an industrial center thanks to the steam engine
early on in his childhood henry encountered technology which few children his age could play around with
he'd tinker with the watches of his <unk> neighbors and by the time he was twelve he could not just take them apart but also put them back together and repair them
his interest grew into an obsession when he got to observe a working steam engine firsthand while on a school trip to one of the rail companies in detroit
by the time henry had become a teenager the steam engine was already making its way into the farming community <unk> <unk> machines and <unk> were becoming common sight and henry was learning how they worked and how to fix them
at the age of sixteen he made a big leap forward when against his father's wishes he left his village to go work in detroit where any young mechanic could easily find very lucrative employment
industry in detroit was booming and it had been doing so for close to five decades in eighteen twenty-five a canal had been dug connecting the hudson river to the great lakes which at the time were effectively the western frontier
all the untapped resources that had not way of getting out could suddenly be moved by <unk> to new york and in the span of just fifty years <unk> population increased by a factor of ten
with vast mines in the north producing copper and iron and lumber mills opening up virtually everywhere
all this metal and wood sustained close to a thousand companies in detroit alone including the ones in which henry would work at over the course of the eighteen eighties
it is during this time that henry by chance learned about the gas engine from a british magazine it was being produced in small numbers by a german engineer <unk> otto
and it was gaining some traction in europe but it was practically unheard of in america henry would get the chance to work on <unk> engine himself in eighteen <unk> and he instantly recognized the advantages it had
because it did not use steam the engine was much lighter it got rid of the heavy boiler and all the water in it because it did all the combustion internally a much more efficient process
this also allowed the gas engine to start quickly whereas steam engines of the time needed as much as thirty minutes to heat up the water and generate enough steam to start working the gas engine was an innovation henry fell in love with
but it was one he didn't fully understand after all he had extensive experience with steam and metal but almost none with electricity and the gas engine was fired by an electric spark
to obtain this missing knowledge henry went to work for the local branch of the edison illuminating company
it was generating electricity for over a thousand homes in detroit and it was doing so by using steam engines so henry was a natural hire for them whenever the engines broke henry had to fix them but whenever they were working
he was free to do as he wished it was the perfect job that allowed him to spend his days experimenting with gas engines in eighteen <unk> when henry had already been promoted to chief engineer at edison
he created his first working gas engine the idea of using the gas engine to create a <unk> carriage had been around in henry's mind since he first laid eyes on one but actually making that idea a reality would take years of work
building a car in a world with no car parts wasn't easy and henry had to figure out every detail through trial and error it took him three years of constant effort to produce this the <unk>
a simple frame with an engine powered by ethanol and four bicycle wheels mounted onto it it had only two gears and neither one was for going in reverse but what's worse is that it had no cooling system to speak of
thus making <unk> a constant issue in its first year henry made numerous improvements to the <unk> most notably adding a cooling system and by the time he sold it in eighteen <unk> for two hundred dollars
he had driven a thousand miles in it henry built a second <unk> and then a third one always improving the design before finally feeling confident enough in eighteen <unk> to start his own company
capitalized at a hundred and fifty thousand dollars the detroit automobile company was a very ambitious venture many of the detroit elite invested in it including henry's friends from the edison company
and everyone was eager to see what henry could create with proper capital henry's plan was very clever since he personally knew many of the <unk> in detroit by that point he'd try to build an automobile they could use in their businesses
he <unk> a factory and planned to hire a hundred workers to make his new delivery wagon as he called it but it turned out that building such complex machines in high numbers was much more difficult than henry imagined
the vast majority of the parts used in the making of the delivery wagon were produced by other companies and every time a single delivery was late the entire factory would have no choice but to stop working
the first delivery wagon took six months to produce and no more than twenty were made in the first two years of the company's existence by the end of nineteen o two the other shareholders were sick of henry's lack of progress
and actually voted to get rid of him now because henry held only fifteen percent of the company he had no choice but to comply
and interestingly enough the man who took over the detroit automobile company would eventually transform it into <unk> but that's a story for a different time what matters is that henry was pushed out of his own company
and had only a thousand dollars to his name it was back to the drawing board and this time henry would take a very different approach instead of targeting businesses with expensive machines henry would design a vehicle to be used by the average man
you see at the time virtually all cars were <unk> items they were mostly made by skilled <unk> one at a time and more often than not were designed for racing which was rapidly becoming a favorite american activity
henry envisioned turning the car from a status symbol into a commodity but doing that would not be easy and in fact it took henry twenty different design iterations before he finally got one that worked
henry labeled his first design as the model a and worked his way through the alphabet over the next five years sustained by capital from his friends and family
but what changed the most during this time is not the car itself but the production process henry learned the importance of having a reliable supply chain when his first company failed which is why this time around
he tried getting as many parts as possible from the same manufacturer the one he chose will probably sound familiar the dodge brothers company a machine shop in detroit that would eventually evolve into the <unk> american brand
the biggest <unk> of all however was henry's chance visit to a slaughterhouse in chicago he saw there something interesting a <unk> line so to speak where multiple workers would process <unk> moving down a line
henry figured he could use the same process but in reverse an assembly line using the money he had saved from some of his earlier models which were also assembled by the dodge brothers
henry was able to build a factory of his own in nineteen o four where he could experiment with the assembly line process by nineteen o five the ford factory employed over three hundred people that built twenty-five cars a day
but henry still hadn't figured everything out he was producing multiple different models at the same time which prevented him from properly using an assembly line
nevertheless there was a sign of things to come the affordable model n created in nineteen o six became the best-selling car in the u s and ford became the biggest car producer in america
it is actually during the production of this model that henry would first use the assembly line process to at least partially assemble some of his cars
it wasn't a full moving assembly line but nevertheless this experiment increased production by a factor of five in the same factory logistics of course was another big part of henry's success
in nineteen o five he created the ford manufacturing company completed with its own factory that started making the engines and <unk> of henry's cars to further eliminate any possibility of delays
but the biggest factor in henry's success came from perhaps the most unexpected place peru now this is a story you're not gonna hear anywhere else so listen carefully
in nineteen o seven henry began construction of heat treatment plant to produce <unk> steel
this <unk> was new to america in fact few furnaces in the u s could even reach the temperature needed to manufacture it the difficulty in producing it however was worth it
because <unk> steel was more than twice as strong as regular steel while actually being lighter now at the time <unk> <unk> was cutting edge research
but henry had an extremely lucky connection he was friends with the two brothers who owned the one <unk> mine in peru producing <unk> percent of the world's supply
joseph and james flannery had <unk> <unk> steel in europe and in the u s by selling it to rail companies but their <unk> mine was producing so much <unk> that they had to do something else with it
they sold <unk> steel to the u s government for the construction of the panama canal but even that wasn't enough so when they met henry in nineteen o six they immediately made him an offer
they would help him transition his entire manufacturing process to use <unk> steel it was their chief engineer that built the heat treatment plant for henry in nineteen o seven
and it was their company that supplied ford with all the <unk> it needed for its cars the first ford car designed with <unk> steel was the model t in nineteen o eight and it was this <unk> that actually made it successful
it wasn't the cheapest car henry had made the model n and its upscale versions were actually cheaper but it didn't need to be because it was by far the best car built at the time much stronger than any competitor
the sheer difference in quality was the only marketing henry needed and within weeks of the model t released ford received twenty-five thousand orders for it
even though it only managed to produce seventeen thousand units for the entirety of nineteen o nine henry realized just how big of a deal the model t was which is why he built a second factory in nineteen ten
and it is there that he would perfect the moving assembly line in nineteen thirteen during this period production would double every year in nineteen ten he built twenty thousand model <unk>
and just six year later he was building over half a million at the same time henry adopted another brilliant strategy he was constantly reducing the price of his car to further increase his market share
in fact during these six years he cut the model <unk> price by more than half by nineteen eighteen half of all cars in america were model <unk> and this trend would continue well into the nineteen twenties
henry had begun a new age in american history the age of the automobile and it was his company that would totally dominate in its first two decades
it wasn't until the end of the nineteen twenties that the rest of the auto industry caught up to henry but at that point he was already one of the richest men alive
in nineteen twenty-two he actually took the time to write an autobiography where parts of this video came from and which you can listen to it for free as part of your <unk> free trial of audible
in his book henry not only recounts his experiences in a very eloquent fashion he also shares plenty of business advice that is actually still relevant today
you should visit audible dot com slash business casual or you can text business casual to five hundred five hundred to get started with audible who have the biggest collection of audiobooks in the world
and if you're more into the manufacturing side of things you should check out the video my friend brian from real engineering made on exactly this topic he will walk you through the beauty of the assembly line that made the automobile miracle possible

when you look at the wealthiest men alive today topping the charts are tech billionaires like jeff bezos and bill gates but actually the wealthiest businessman to have ever lived died almost a century ago
in today's video we'll be looking at a business empire so vast that even after a hundred years of technological progress no man has managed to overtake its founder this is the history of standard oil
this video was brought to you by dollar shave club visit the link in the description to learn about the awesome deal they're offering
the origins of <unk> greatest oil monopoly are actually pretty humble it all starts in eighteen <unk> with the birth of john rockefeller in upstate new york he was the eldest son of a travelling merchant
who identified himself as a <unk> physician but in reality was selling the nineteenth century equivalent of <unk> medicine
he would spend weeks away from home and in fact would have several children with another woman who he decided to bring back home to his wife
so they could all live together in this very confusing household john would grow up learning how to hustle people for the best deal possible and how to get the most out of every penny he got his family would rarely stay in one place for long
and john would live this nomadic lifestyle ever since he was three years old to help his mother john would earn any money he could by raising turkeys or doing work for neighbors his intelligence was put to good use
when the family moved to cleveland ohio in eighteen <unk> where he got the chance to attend a proper school but less than a year later john dropped out in order to work as a <unk> at a local produce broker he would earn fifty cents per day
which obviously wasn't much at the time so he would help other companies on the side but after two years of working there his bosses refused to give him a meaningful raise so he decided to one up them by starting his own produce <unk>
thanks to his good reputation he got a loan of four thousand dollars which at the time was a huge sum john started trading hay grain and various meats and in his first year he recorded sales of half a million dollars
of which he only got a small fraction as commissions but still it was a huge success every bank in cleveland was begging john to borrow money and he was barely eighteen years old but then in eighteen <unk>
something happened that would change his life forever just a hundred miles east of cleveland the first american oil well had been discovered this marked the beginning of the pennsylvania oil rush and within a year
four and half thousand barrels of oil would be produced now back then oil wasn't quite as valuable as it today gasoline cars hadn't been invented yet but oil could still be processed into <unk> which people would then use in lamps
john realized however that the biggest profits to be had weren't in drilling for oil but in refining it he witnessed many people going bust before striking oil so he knew that that business was too risky for him
instead he'd let others go through the <unk> of finding the oil and he would just buy it off of them john had to wait until eighteen <unk> for the government to build a rail line connecting the pennsylvania oil fields to cleveland
but when that line was built john was ready for it with a long line of partners and banks ready to back him up he also assembled a team of seasoned chemists and engineers who not only optimized the refining process but also discovered various uses
for the byproducts of refining petroleum you see the early <unk> in cleveland could only operate at about sixty percent efficiency but john not only increased that percentage he also started selling all the byproducts like <unk> wax
tar and <unk> within two years the rockefeller <unk> was worth over seventy thousand dollars and was among the largest in cleveland but john wasn't done
in eighteen <unk> there were <unk> competing <unk> but within five years john had acquired all but four of them
by this point his business was getting too big to handle as a partnership so in eighteen seventy he incorporated as standard oil of ohio to convince the few remaining competitors in cleveland john would simply invite them over and show them his books
revealing that he could operate at a loss far longer than they could stay solvent in exchange for a good <unk> price john would offer his competitors positions in his own company thus placing the brightest minds in the industry under his control
of course not everyone would give up immediately and over time john eroded the price of oil and <unk> sometimes by as much as eighty percent in order to strangle competitors unsurprisingly his strategy worked
by eighteen eighty he had acquired <unk> across the northeastern u s and was refining over ninety percent of the entire country's oil production at this point john was so powerful that he would invite the owners of the big rail companies
and personally negotiate <unk> for using their trains but this practice of negotiating <unk> deals really got the business world riled up at the time and still kind of today most industrial goods were transported by rail
and many big <unk> got worried
that john's abuse of transportation <unk> could result in similar <unk> in their industries
over the next decade businessmen politicians and the media would attack standard oil with increasing ferocity legislators in ohio began drafting antitrust regulations to bring down rockefeller but he was one step ahead
in eighteen <unk> he <unk> in new jersey this time creating the standard oil trust which in turn held stakes in over forty local companies
then to showcase his success john built an impressive headquarters for his company on broadway this moment was the high point of <unk> standard oil
he owned twenty thousand oil wells four thousand miles of pipeline and employed over a hundred thousand people but his grip on the oil industry was loosening both domestically and abroad
massive oil deposits had been discovered in russia and in asia and were being developed by the rothschild family which spared no effort in getting that oil to america
worse yet in eighteen ninety the federal government passed the sherman antitrust act which finally gave politicians the teeth to go after the standard oil trust itself
of course the complex legal structure behind all the companies was very difficult to investigate which is why it the government couldn't actually break up standard oil until nineteen eleven
by that point however john rockefeller had already <unk> in and was no longer actively managing the company in the final twenty years of his company's existence it had paid out over half a billion dollars in dividends
by some estimates the true worth of standard oil at its peak was one trillion dollars so the breakup didn't really come as a surprise to most people in nineteen eleven the supreme court found standard oil guilty of <unk> practices
and broke the company up into <unk> separate entities of course john rockefeller kept his stake in those companies until his death and in fact it turns out that the breakup was the most profitable event in his life
you see over time many of those companies merged back with one another today most of the standard remnants are part of either <unk> <unk> or b p which have since become incredibly large companies in their own right
john <unk> ownership of these successor companies made him the richest businessman to have ever lived with an estimated net worth of four hundred billion dollars even today no one has beaten rockefeller in the <unk>
not even jeff bezos himself seems likely to achieve that but there's one thing that jeff bezos does have that john rockefeller never did despite all his money and that is access to dollar shave club
i mean look at him it's clear that this man cares very much about looking and feeling at his very best but guess what you too can experience the splendor of dollar shave club's daily essential starter set
which by the way new members can get for just five dollars that set includes shave butter body wash and one wipe <unk> butt wipes to really make you feel special and if that wasn't enough you'll also get their executive razor

anyhow we'll see each other again in two weeks and until then stay smart
the rothschild banking dynasty easily one of the wealthiest families in history but also the single largest source of conspiracy theories
the vast and shrouded wealth of the <unk> has endured for generations and has unsurprisingly made it hard to tell what is fact and what is fiction
in this video we're going back to the earliest days of this famous jewish family to see how they managed to build one of the greatest fortunes in history at a time of rampant anti-semitism
this video is brought to you by skillshare with whom i've partnered to make a series of educational videos on the stock market which you can watch for free by using the link in the description our story begins in medieval europe
by the tenth century most of europe was under the domain of christianity political power was invariably tied to religion which made being a <unk> very unfavorable perhaps the biggest victims of these circumstances was the jews
having no home state of their own to fall back to the jews were scattered throughout europe and many of them settled in the holy roman empire
this vast <unk> state contained modern day germany and like the rest of europe it too wasn't happy to harbor the jews
in many cities the jews we forced to live in particular neighborhoods in what we now call ghettos and the city of frankfurt was no exception
from fourteen <unk> on wards it confined all the jews in the city to a single narrow street outside the city walls that street came to be known as the <unk> or the jewish alley and it was made up of numerous tightly packed houses
back then the buildings weren't distinguished by numbers but by signs one building could be the house of the ship for example while another could be the house of the golden stone the sign on one of those houses was a red shield
or rothschild in german and the family living in the house had gone by the same name since at least fifteen <unk> like most jewish families at the time the <unk> were involved in finance
you see in medieval europe christianity forbade anyone from lending money with interest leaving this otherwise profitable business into the hands of the jews experience with money lending and by extension anything relating to finance was passed down generations
and the <unk> were no exception they specialized in exchanging currencies and trading <unk> coins and the best one of them all was mayer rothschild he took up the family business in seventeen <unk> and his extensive collection of coins
attracted the wealthiest aristocrats in the holy roman empire among them was crown prince <unk> of <unk> the prince met mayer in seventeen <unk> and quickly learned to trust him with all matters relating not just to <unk> coins
but to anything financial when <unk> came into power as <unk> ninth of <unk> in seventeen <unk> he hired mayer to manage his finances as his <unk> or court jew now keep in mind this was a common arrangement in central europe
the nobility would outsource their finances to jews in exchange for protection money and sometimes even actual noble titles mayer oversaw the taxes collected in <unk> lands and had to keep his money safe
a task that became very difficult in eighteen o six that is the year when napoleon invaded <unk> driving <unk> into exile and putting his fortune at risk but mayer was smart and he was ready for napoleon
in seventeen <unk> he had sent one of his five sons nathan rothschild to london to start a currency business similar to his father's with this foundation in place mayer had no trouble moving <unk> fortune to london
where he then loaned it out to the british crown in essence <unk> was funding the british to fight napoleon in order to restore his power now mayer died in eighteen twelve leaving <unk> fortune and the rothschild legacy in the hands of nathan
he remained in london while his eldest brother took over the original frankfurt business meanwhile the three remaining brothers scattered throughout europe establishing branches in important european capitals
despite the distance the brothers applied a unified strategy they would loan out their money to the aristocracy and to local governments the brother in france for example became the banker of leopold the first of belgium
while the one in vienna would lend money to last holy roman emperor francis the second in eighteen eighteen he would grant all five brothers the noble title of baron finally elevating the <unk> to nobility
throughout the next decades whenever a european government collapsed and was replaced it was the <unk> who were first in line to provide loans that's exactly what happened after the french revolution of eighteen thirty or after the fall of the holy roman empire
the <unk> business was immensely successful the paris branch for example grew from the equivalent of five million dollars in eighteen twenty to over half a billion dollars in eighteen fifty
in essence the five rothschild baking families back then provided the same service that the international monetary fund provides today they stabilized major currencies and provided loans to governments doing both at a great profit
of course throughout the nineteenth century the five branches also made many private investments beyond their government loans in eighteen <unk> they purchased one of the most valuable wine estates in france
in eighteen seventy-five they acquired a minority stake in the <unk> canal from egypt while in eighteen <unk> they funded the development of the first major oil well in the old world challenging the rockefeller monopoly in america
they also became majority shareholders in the diamond monopoly of de beers and in rio <unk> one of the world's largest mining companies but during the twentieth century the newer generations of the five rothschild families made fewer and fewer successful moves
in nineteen hundred the branch in naples actually became extinct when the last male heir died without children leaving his fortune to the branch in paris a somewhat amusing fate befell the branch in germany
there the two rothschild heirs had eleven girls and not a single boy splitting up the fortune and <unk> its power the rothschild branch in austria was doing well until hitler came to power of course
when nazi germany annexed austria in nineteen thirty-eight the <unk> had to sell their banking operation for a fraction of its true worth most of them escaped with whatever liquid assets they had but at least one was captured on his way out
and in fact he was only released after paying the largest ransom in history at the time twenty one million dollars the ransom effectively <unk> the austrian <unk> while the nazis seized all their mansions businesses and art
a few years later exactly the same thing happened to the branch in paris in fact the collections they had were so exquisite that hitler and <unk> <unk> personally went there to observe them and to pick out what they liked
through the detailed inventories compiled by the nazis we know that they seized a total of five thousand and three objects from the rothschild collections and the vast majority of them were never returned
the french <unk> had some luck restoring their businesses after the war but then the french socialists <unk> their bank in nineteen <unk> in the end only the english branch survived the twentieth century with its fortune intact
its patriarch during the second half of the twentieth century was sir evelyn rothschild who even today is the financial advisor to queen elizabeth he retired from leadership in two thousand and three passing on the mantle of patriarch to david rothschild
a member of the branch in paris who then merged both branches into a single entity he ensured the secrecy of the family's fortune by establishing a complex network of shell companies starting off in switzerland but ending god knows where
but at the end of the day while the nineteenth century banking family might have been one of the richest of its day today the <unk> are a shadow of their former glory in fact if you open up the forbes list of billionaires
the first rothschild appears at number eight hundred and twenty-two that's jeff rothschild a man who actually has nothing to do with the rothschild banking family
he has no blood connection he just happens to share the name in the same way that two men bearing the family name goldman might not be related the first actual rothschild appearing on this list is only at number one thousand two hundred and <unk>
and his wealth is tied to an asset management company that manages other people's money so in the end it turns out that the once powerful rothschild family is really nothing more but a blip on the radar of global wealth
and it honestly makes sense statistically ninety percent of wealthy families lose their fortunes by the third generation it's just hard to be financially responsible when you're born into wealth and have no respect for money
why bother learning how to invest and grow your wealth when you can just spend whatever grandpa left you well if you want to escape this vicious cycle or at least kick the can down the road for another generation
you'll be happy to learn that i made a series of education videos on skillshare about how the stock market works in these short animated clips i cover basic topics like what is a stock or an e t f or why companies go public

we'll see each other again in two weeks and until then stay smart
the internet has completely changed the way we watch television <unk> the days when the whole family would gather in the living room to enjoy the exact same program as everyone else
technology has advanced to the point where we've dumped the old <unk> boxes in favor of our phones and computers in today's world you can watch whatever you want whenever you want on-demand straight from the internet
we are now in the age of <unk> and so this week on behind the business we'll be taking a look at the company that lies at the heart of this recent revolution netflix
the year is nineteen <unk> and reed <unk> was getting ready to start his first company <unk> was a rather unusual tech entrepreneur
he came from minnesota and after graduating from college and serving briefly in the military he decided to travel to <unk> with the peace corps to teach math
after returning to the u s and getting a masters in computer science he and two of his friends started a company in nineteen <unk> called pure software as the company sold a range of debugging tools for <unk> operating systems at a time when there were few good ones on the market
and so it rapidly became a big player in the i t world it doubled its revenue every year for four years in a row and in nineteen <unk> it was sold to rational software for seven hundred million dollars
in the span of half a decade <unk> had become a millionaire
life seemed great but in nineteen <unk> he suffered an inconvenience that would eventually become a <unk> <unk> had forgotten to return his <unk> of apollo thirteen and as a result was slapped with a forty dollar late fee
he was embarrassed and didn't want to tell his wife and that got him to thinking of a solution not just a solution to his own <unk> problem but a solution to everyone's problem an entirely new system of film rental that would make late fees obsolete
together with a friend of his on august <unk> nineteen <unk> in <unk> valley california <unk> founded a brand new movie rental service called netflix with the idea of mailing d v ds to paying customers
the creation of netflix was essentially a bet on the d v d player now the d v d player had been invented in taiwan in nineteen <unk> by sony but it wouldn't be until march nineteen <unk> that one was first sold in the u s
back then a player cost over a thousand dollars and when netflix was formed less than one percent of americans actually owned one
in a move that seemed insane at the time <unk> <unk> everything on the potential of d v d technology to replace the <unk> <unk> <unk> as the nation's format of choice
in nineteen <unk> it was almost impossible for people to rent d v ds because very few places had any
after trying over two hundred different mailing packages and testing them out by mailing them to himself <unk> discovered that he could safely ship a d v d for the small cost of a first-class mail stamp
this way netflix could guarantee that most titles would be in stock and by <unk> a stamped return <unk> they could make the experience of <unk> as convenient as possible
thus on april fourteen nineteen <unk> with thirty employees and an assortment of nine hundred twenty-five titles netflix opened for business
their first offer was for a seven day rental at the price of four dollars plus a two dollar shipping fee they also introduced something that is now one of <unk> proudest hallmark smart suggestion algorithms
once a customer had rented enough titles netflix could automatically suggest new movies that were likely to interest them nowadays when google and facebook know everything about us it's easy to take such algorithms for granted but in nineteen <unk> they were practically unheard of
netflix started strong and just forty-eight hours after opening they had to upgrade their <unk> bandwidth due to excessive traffic they were receiving
soon netflix signed promotional deals with <unk> <unk> and sony whereby they offered free <unk> to people who bought new d v d players
in july nineteen <unk> netflix secured a thirty million dollar capital <unk> from <unk> <unk> which allowed them to start a <unk> service called the marquee program
for just under sixteen dollars per month customers could rent out as many d v ds as they wanted as long as they had no more than four d v ds at any given time no late fees no due dates it was perfect
by that point netflix was already receiving ten thousand d v d orders every day but their total revenue was sitting at barely five million dollars compare this to <unk> four point five billion dollar revenue and you'll probably see why netflix decided to try to team up with them
blockbuster was one of the oldest video rental companies and it was by far the largest with sixty thousand employees and eight thousand stores spread across the u s
as the popularity of netflix grew everyone thought blockbuster would soon enter the market and with their vast resources they would've probably crushed their young competitor
that is why netflix decided to act first and so in the early year two thousand they invited blockbuster to become a strategic partner and investor
netflix would become the internet arm of the blockbuster brand dropping the netflix name altogether in favor of blockbuster dot com
blockbuster laughed them out of the <unk> they were certain netflix would crumble as it has yet to turn a profit three years after its creation instead a few months later blockbuster partnered up with <unk> broadband
a division of the energy company you probably know today for its notoriously fraudulent accounting practices
of course at the time nobody knew that and so investors praised <unk> decision the situation for netflix looked grim they were losing money fast and by the end of the year they reported a net loss of <unk> million dollars
despite doubts coming from all sides <unk> was convinced that d v d technology would prevail the only thing that mattered to him was to simply survive until that happened and two thousand one was the year when things finally started going his way
the price of d v d players <unk> with some going around for less than a hundred bucks two thousand one also saw the nine eleven terrorist attacks fearful americans took refuge in their homes and netflix subscriptions skyrocketed
despite growing at an unprecedented rate netflix still hadn't turned a profit and so in two thousand two they went public to keep the company going in two thousand three they crossed the one million subscriber mark and finally had their first profitable year
just as their fortune started to turn however in two thousand four blockbuster finally released their own online d v d mail service before long walmart also joined the fray and a three way battle to undercut one another ensued
blockbuster and walmart however were a bit late to the party <unk> admitted that if they had started two years earlier they probably would have won on an end of year conference call <unk> declared blockbuster has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at us
when the c e o of blockbuster heard that he promptly had a kitchen sink delivered to the netflix office a fairly creative way of declaring war
as the competitors undercut one another netflix saw its brief profitability <unk> and its stock fell by seventy-five percent
despite losing money they kept on growing and by two thousand five netflix was shipping one million d v ds every day from their assortment of over thirty-five thousand titles eventually this <unk> battle of attrition took its toll
and in two thousand five walmart decided to quit blockbuster followed suit and as the era of <unk> video rental came to an end so did their success in two thousand eight the same c e o that had rejected netflix was fired
and by two thousand ten blockbuster had filed for bankruptcy netflix had emerged victorious and in two thousand seven it celebrated the delivery of its <unk> d v d then in a single announcement <unk> began the journey of making the very bedrock of his company obsolete
this was his <unk> the reason he had been willing to sacrifice profits for so long and the same reason he had <unk> cited back in the year two thousand <unk>
netflix first started offering streaming of on-demand videos in two thousand seven and initially the service was at no additional charge at first movie rights were hard to come by and the videos available to stream on netflix were well pretty awful
but in october two thousand eight they signed a deal with premium cable outlet <unk> which brought in some huge disney and sony library releases the deal cost netflix only twenty million dollars a price that they soon discovered was an absolute bargain
the reason netflix got such a great price was because they were the only big player in town and pretty soon they signed deals with paramount m g m and <unk>
netflix were also pushing for partnerships with other brands and before long they were featured on nearly every major entertainment system on the planet they <unk> up with apple playstation xbox nintendo <unk> and a bunch of other brands
by two thousand ten nearly thirty percent of all north american broadband traffic during peak hours came from netflix they expanded into canada in two thousand ten latin america and the caribbean in two thousand eleven and europe in two thousand twelve
two thousand eleven turned out to be a year of huge surprises for netflix in response to the ever increasing cost of content streaming licenses netflix announced the production of their first piece of original content it would be a political drama called house of cards
featuring kevin <unk> and directed by david <unk> netflix managed to <unk> h b o by ordering the first two seasons upfront for one hundred million dollars in october of that year however netflix made a much less successful move
they introduced a new service called <unk> which yes is spelled with a w in reality there was nothing new about <unk> at all it was basically the <unk> of <unk> old d v d rental service
the branding was sloppy unimaginative and just not <unk> but the public's response to <unk> was even worse netflix lost eight hundred thousand subscribers in a single month and three months later their shares had lost two thirds their value
unsurprisingly they shut <unk> down the very next month bringing the two arms of the business back together the first piece of netflix original content was <unk> which aired on february sixth two thousand twelve
it was a relative success and it paved the way for the bigger shows that were to follow in two thousand thirteen first and foremost was house of cards which first aired on february first and became one of <unk> most acclaimed titles
airing the entire first season all at once was a bold move by netflix and it <unk> the way people watch t v shows following the same format came arrested development in may and orange is the new black in july
netflix continued to use suggestion algorithms to keep people glued to their computers watching series after series each available in its entirety on-demand
these algorithms have become exponentially smarter in recent years and they can now spot gaps in the market giving netflix an edge in developing new shows
at this point netflix can create original content based solely on what their customers want before they even know that they want it
that strategy has worked out <unk> for them so far and in two thousand thirteen netflix received fourteen emmy nominations nine of which were for house of cards
they continue to create original content from t v series to documentaries to movies though perhaps their faith in adam <unk> with whom they are releasing four new movies is somewhat misplaced
by the end of two thousand sixteen netflix will have released six hundred hours of new original content for the year and they will have spent a <unk> six billion dollars on content acquisition this aggressive expansion is the only option they have
with amazon and hulu knocking on the door with their own on-demand services and original content recently netflix integrated its service with <unk> x one platform a deal that could bring them upwards of four million new subscribers
in such a competitive market however a single mistake can be deadly and there are more than enough companies out there eagerly awaiting <unk> next stumble it's still on top at the moment but the real question is how long can it stay there

larry page and sergey <unk> were the kind of guys who kept bill gates up at night journalist ken <unk>
i said mister gates what is your nightmare and i thought he would say apple or <unk> or oracle and he said i'll tell you what i worry about
i worry about some guy in a garage inventing a new technology microsoft has never thought about
well the <unk> two guys ran a garage with a <unk> sign and it said google worldwide headquarters
in an industry where innovation is just part of the job description larry page and sergey <unk> have become virtual masters of the universe of information gathering
what we don't know we google
six hundred and <unk> thousand results wow and all this time i thought googling yourself meant the other thing
not anymore
silicon valley is littered with <unk> that have stalled out
why these two computer science <unk> succeeded may have a lot to do with the nearly parallel lives they led before creating together one of the world's largest and most powerful companies
brennan page respectfully declined to participate in this program
sergey <unk> was born in the soviet union in nineteen <unk> his parents were mathematicians and jewish which limited their career opportunities
mark <unk> is the co-author of the google story
so <unk> father went to a conference in warsaw met a whole bunch of colleagues from the west saw what life was like outside the soviet union came back settle the family down and said we have to leave
his parents brought with him a sense of purpose they instilled in their son it boiled down to a simple message
don't come back with a b don't come back with the second place award make it the first
always and <unk> internalized this and it did form a core part of his personality
like <unk> larry page was born in nineteen <unk>
his family lived in michigan and his father was the first person in his family to get a college degree
both of his parents were in similar fields as <unk>
there was a second generation computer science which at that time was very unusual because computer science was really only developing as a field
in the sixties and here both of their parents were advanced degrees
they see themselves as on a mission and that mission it really does spring from
in two thousand and nine page shared that mission with the graduating class at the university of michigan
you know what it's like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream and you know how if you don't have a pencil and a pad by the bed
it will be completely gone by the next morning i had one of those dreams when i was twenty-three
when i suddenly woke up i was thinking what if we could download the whole web and just keep the links and i grabbed a pen and started writing
soon after i told my adviser terry <unk>
it would take a couple of weeks for me to download the web he nodded knowingly fully aware it would take much longer but wise enough not to tell me
stanford professor and engineering consultant to google terry <unk>
larry just thinks of ways of doing things that you might not expect <unk> was a lot like larry he also was someone who really wanted to think outside the box to say if that sounds like it's impossible let's try it
it was nineteen <unk> at stanford university when the headstrong <unk> first met
one of their stanford professors used to say well the difference between the two of them was that <unk> would just burst into my office without asking larry would knock and then burst in
in the nineties searching the internet was rudimentary hit or miss often returning results that were useless and the process was very slow
you type in your query you did something else while you waited for it to get the results then you went back and looked at the results and most of them were completely irrelevant
page and <unk> pushed for something better
<unk> big interest was in taking all the pages on the world wide web and trying to make sense of it trying to find patterns
they started to do a record of back links they called them
page noticed that behind every web page there were hundreds or even thousands of other pages that linked to it
it was a eureka moment that would change the so-called information age
then they realized that list of back links could be used for ranking
show you a better page
if a lot of other websites link to a web page that probably meant users thought it was good
the geniuses are recognizing that this kind of algorithm could give you the kind of results that matter the most to <unk>
page and <unk> had their secret formula
now it needed a name
the guys were looking for a great name that was gonna capture the grandest vision that they had and hit upon this giant number
one with a hundred zeros after it commonly known as <unk> g o o g o l
they discovered it was owned they said you know what let's put a <unk> spelling on it
on september fifteenth nineteen <unk> they registered google as a website
and page and <unk> dropped out of their p h d programs to focus on attracting funding for their young company
it wouldn't be easy investors like rob sharon were skeptical
there were five search engines at the time and so i said maybe any one of them might be interested in the technology the world didn't need a sixth search engine
google just didn't fit into the conventional wisdom of what a website should do which was to keep users from migrating to another page
google did the unthinkable it helped users explore the wider web
larry page and sergey <unk> have a different attitude they said we don't want a portal
we want to get the search results to them in a split second
the one sunday morning larry and <unk> were sitting on the porch of a a stanford professor a friend of theirs
and andy <unk> one of the founders of sun <unk> pulls up in his sports car walks up gets about a ten minute demo says this is fantastic this is the next big big thing
and writes a check on the spot for a hundred thousand dollars made out to google inc
steven levy is senior writer of wired magazine
this is the way things work in silicon valley you know it it it sounds astounding that someone would just write a hundred thousand dollar check and get you going
but you have to realize that there was a a hidden <unk> to this
they were at stanford they're professors had done this before this is a pretty good bet we might lose a hundred thousand dollars but we could win big there
and at the time we had no company at all
and in fact we couldn't cash the check
this by the way with no legal documents you know none of that stuff
and even though they had the seed money they still needed much more cash no one was buying into google
they went back to rob sharon
they found three other investors and together we raised enough money to get them off the ground
enough money was one million dollars including two hundred and fifty thousand dollars from jeff bezos of amazon dot com
page and <unk> incorporated google on september fourth nineteen <unk> and they moved into one of those storage <unk> in <unk> park
they attracted the attention of two well known silicon valley venture capitalists michael <unk> of <unk> capital and john <unk> of <unk> perkins
both wanted an exclusive deal brennan page said no deal
they had the presence of mind at the tender age like twenties then they say we won't take money from only one venture capitalist
we want to assure that neither one of them have controls who wanna to split it
in june of nineteen <unk> google issued its first press release announcing the investment twenty-five million dollars
<unk> and page now needed to hire first rate engineers people who would meet their exacting standards
chris soccer is a former <unk>
it was one of the most intense hiring processes of any company in the world i had somewhere between twelve and fifteen interviews over just a couple of days
they created a headquarters they called the google <unk> offering employees services like free food and childcare and developed the informal company motto of don't be evil
but google still wasn't making money
larry would come in and say well how are you gonna make money from this he just gave us a smile and say well we'll figure that out
google <unk> larry page and sergey <unk> had created a new search engine but have yet to find a way to turn it into a profit
they didn't like the idea of using advertising to cash in
at first they thought advertising was <unk> commercial kind of unseemly
their famously sparse homepage was originally designed by sergey <unk>
unlike rivals yahoo and a o l page and <unk> refused to clutter their home page with ads
we won't take any ads on the homepage because we think to build user trust we want to not feel like we're <unk> them down with advertisements
yet no ads at all meant no revenue
page and <unk> had to accept advertising as their only option
there were search engines in the early days which when you went to a page the first few things which looked just like regular search results happen to be things that the sponsors of those had paid the search engine to put there
and they said that's not good for users i don't want the things that somebody else wants me to see i want the things that i wanna see
then they found a compromise they could live with
they invented a new way of targeting text ads triggered by search requests
instead of distracting <unk> or flashing ads these small ads were placed above and next to search results
it's familiar now but revolutionary back then
they called it google ad words
businesses big and small could take control of their advertising dollars by purchasing ads key to certain words
david <unk> was a project manager on ad words
advertisers love the system because they only pay when someone actually clicks on the ad
for many advertisers it's the most efficient form of marketing they ever have
for businesses it was the holy grail a direct connection to their best customers with a massive new revenue source google exploded
by september of two thousand it had indexed a billion u r <unk> and was available in fifteen languages
still with all of google's success few people outside silicon valley knew who had created it
sergey <unk> went on to tell the truth
and fool the judges
will real sergey <unk> please stand up
but media <unk> knew exactly who they were
barry <unk> was one of the first traditional media executives to visit those guys
barry is sitting there with his p d a his little hand held devices looking down and doing his email
and he says larry please i am talking to you can we just converse
and he says i can do both barry <unk> says no you can't have both choose he says i choose this
tremendous growth came other challenging issues for the search giant google
the venture capitalists behind the company michael <unk> and john <unk> were <unk> its <unk> to hire a c e o
their resisted but they don't wanna say you know we could do it but they thought they could do it
they went through twelve thirteen fourteen interviews
they don't like any of the people that they saw
they visited steve jobs just to meet him because he was a hero of theirs and they said to john <unk> after the meeting why can't he be our c e o
john <unk> introduced page and <unk> to eric schmidt a businessman with an engineering background
please come over to run google
yes
what what's the idea behind that you guys couldn't run it yourself
yeah ah parental supervision
to be honest you know
eric is a grown-up in in the room i mean he's in his mid <unk> not mid thirties he's got a lot of experience
he's more of a diplomat than they are and that's needed in dealing with the traditional media world which they increasingly bumping up against
by the end of two thousand and one eric schmidt was google c e o page became president of products and <unk> the president of technology
the two founders still shared an office
they have a mind now they anticipate each other's words they back each other up there is no sense of tension between them that's one of the greatest strengths of their company
with eric schmidt in place google kept up its spectacular growth while its rivals slowly faded away
the search engine links to three billion web pages and forged a partnership with a o l which brought them <unk> million new customers
you have this incredibly profitable company how are you gonna to get us to the next level how are you gonna provide the kind of capital growth that they needed
the solution it was time for google to go public
being unconventional they decided that they were gonna hold an i p o unlike any that wall street had ever seen they were gonna set the price via an auction to determine and try to extract the greatest value from the stock
the stock price on august nineteenth two thousand and four closed to just over one hundred dollars a share making the company worth more than twenty-three billion dollars
the two founders became billionaires
soon the company expanded with google maps google news and google earth
their idealism and bold ideas had built their reputation but the company was stumbling with their free email service
gmail was a great product that was really poorly launched
when users saw ads pop up that were directly related to their personal emails alarms went off
when people first saw these ads they were shocked because they thought how could these ads be so targeted you know i'm reading this this email about ah you know my friend's vacation to hawaii and i'm getting ads about hawaii is somebody <unk> into my email
the concern around gmail launched a much deeper fundamental argument about privacy and trust
do you know how google is using all the information it collects on you
all of the web searches that i've done for years and years all of the emails that i've done potentially information about health records information about the books that i'm looking at information about where i'm going because i'm typing it into google maps
in a sense they're the big brother that we've been talking about all these years
the ultimate big brother was about to put their don't be evil philosophy to the test
in two thousand and six google reached an agreement with china for access to their four hundred million web users
with one condition they censor search results of banned topics
for <unk> son of russian immigrants it was a troubling decision
at google's friday meeting sergey spoke with passion about growing up in a soviet union house and that his parents literally escaped the soviet union to come to america and what that meant to him
and then a dialogue happened including everybody they wanted to hear from all the employees there
sergey swallowed hard but they all said that at google this is the biggest consumer market in the world we have to be here
google agreed to chinese demands
i know there was a lot of controversy surrounding that and we have to self ah censor ah a fair amount but we were actually able to censor less and less
and our local competitors there also censored less and less
so i feel like our entry
made a big difference
ah but things ah started going downhill
google discovered a cyber attack on their systems
more troubling thing to me is that we discovered the motivation ah which we believed to be to gain access to gmail accounts in particular for chinese human rights activists
google pulled the plug and redirected users to an <unk> site in hong kong that isn't subject to censorship
it's real life
yeah this is real life
youtube began as a place for people to share home videos it soon grew into one of the world's top search engines
by july two thousand and six users were up loading <unk> thousand videos a day and google wanted in
they went out and acquired youtube for one point six five billion dollars in google stock
youtube founders chad <unk> and steve chen were thrilled
today we have some exciting news for you we've been acquired by google yeah thanks
in two thousand and six google c e o eric schmidt acknowledged that to stay competitive the company also had to enter the world of mobile phones
in fact a year earlier they had quietly bought another start-up android a small company with software for cell phones
there are so many more mobile phones than personal computers as people do more and more searches on mobile phones it should eventually balance out again this would be many years
it didn't take years
apple's phenomenal success with the iphone in two thousand and seven set a collision course between the two companies
hey guys i'm very excited to be here today
months later <unk> and page announced their android operating system would run on a variety of mobile phones
their long-time idol steve jobs slammed google for entering the phone business and accused them of trying to kill the iphone
at the google developer conference in may of two thousand and ten google's vice president of engineering tore into apple
if google did not act we faced a draconian future
a future where one man one company one device one carrier would be our only choice
that's a future we don't want
and google is battling with another giant in the tech world
they pop up against microsoft in so many ways they have a browser chrome microsoft has internet explorer
google also acquired companies that dealt with online versions of word processing software and spreadsheets
things that directly go after microsoft jugular with their office products
microsoft fired back with its own search engine bing which debuted in spring of two thousand and nine
can i ask what you make of bing do you like it
um ah i think ah
you a bing user
ah oh yeah no no i i i use i use all search engines out there
ah i think that what bing reminded us ah ah the the search is a very competitive market
bing ironically offered google protection by letting them dodge accusations of being a monopoly
bill gates said this is the company that is closest to us as a competitor
they are just as hungry and as ruthless you can use that word but i am as we are there is a danger they make a lot of enemies
it's a blind spot because these two founders really think of themselves as noble men
they think that what they're doing is good for the world they've always enjoyed feeling like the underdog feeling like the evil empire was microsoft
and now they've discovered that some people think they're the evil empire
their own slogan do no evil was suddenly being used against them
google's quest on the road to organize the world's information took a new turn called it a detour with an ambitious feature they called street view and attempt to photograph every neighborhood on the planet
it would eventually include ordinary images from main street
extraordinary views of antarctica
many people felt their privacy had been compromised
google acknowledged the mistake and agreed to destroy data
the company known for search was struggling to diversify and was facing an aggressive new challenger mark zuckerberg
facebook's one billion users spend more time on the social network posting valuable information that is invisible to google search engine
information that all advertisers chase
so far google's efforts at social networking have failed but its founders are keenly aware that its users habits on the web change
google will have to make a lot more friends
in january two thousand and eleven in a startling silicon valley <unk> eric schmidt announced that google was simplifying its management structure
and that larry page was ready to lead and would take over from him as c e o
co-founder sergey <unk> will focus on new products
schmidt tweeted day-to-day adult supervision no longer needed
in fourteen years google grew from start-up to technology giant hitting fifty billion dollars in revenue in two thousand and twelve
in the space of a year larry page and sergey <unk> both got married
page married stanford bio <unk> p h d lucinda <unk> in december two thousand and seven on richard <unk> island <unk> was also his best man
<unk> married biotech specialist anne <unk> in the <unk> with his partner larry page standing up for him they both have two children
google dot org its philanthropic arm has contributed over one hundred million dollars to various organizations from clean energy to global health
larry page and sergey <unk> have changed the way we get information
it's been a a great experience for me to see them grow over the last twelve years that i've known them ah i i feel extremely proud of what they've accomplished
larry and <unk> always had this kind of <unk> as part of their attitude which is what made them so creative it's great
i think google attracts people who care who care about users who care about the fellow feeling who care about the planet and just can't sit still they built a company that absolutely changed the world
spacex and tesla you would be hard pressed to find two companies that are more popular today
and yet in the not too distant past both companies were basically unknown and were in fact simultaneously on the verge of bankruptcy
today we'll learn how elon musk did what no other american c e o had ever done before he created and then rescued two companies at the same time
and brought them both to multi billion dollar <unk>
this video is brought to you by audible and the story presented in it is just one chapter of elon <unk> awesome biography
which you can listen to for free as part of your <unk> free trial if you register with the link in the description
in the early two thousand elon musk achieved what any entrepreneur would dream of achieving he successfully sold his company for over a billion dollars
he personally received a hundred and <unk> million and now this is where most people would call it quits but for elon this was just the beginning
he wanted to change the world for the better and one of his ideas was to send a greenhouse to mars
in order to boost public interest in space exploration and hopefully increase nasa's budget
the idea was <unk> ambitious especially because elon wanted to spend no more than twenty million dollars on it
now at the time sending just five hundred pounds to orbit could easily cost upwards of thirty million but elon had a plan
he traveled to russia where he trying to buy <unk> <unk> ballistic missiles
but the lowest price the russians gave him was eight million dollars a piece about fifty percent above his budget for the rocket itself
on the way back from moscow elon did some <unk> calculations
he figured out that the raw materials used in the making of a rocket were only about three percent of the final sales price
instantly elon knew what he had to do if he wanted to send anything to mars he'd have to build himself a vertically integrated rocket company
to that end he read several books on <unk> from the cold war and in june two thousand and two he incorporated space exploration technologies or spacex for short
he then set about recruiting the right people who could make his vision a reality
his ideal candidate was young single educated and ready to give up his social life for spacex
<unk> recruitment strategy was very straightforward
he'd basically co-op anyone fitting that profile from fresh aerospace graduates to the rising stars in boeing and lockheed martin
at first people thought elon was making pranks but within a year he had assembled some of the brightest engineers in america
together they would design almost everything for spacex from the engines and rocket bodies to even smallest details like the <unk>
in many cases the engineers could build stronger and more lightweight components at just a fraction of the regular price
these components would be used to build the <unk> engine which in turn would power <unk> first rocket the falcon one
development was far from smooth of course but nevertheless progress was being made but then elon decided to up the ante
in early two thousand and four he participated in the funding round of a new electric car company called tesla
he personally invested a little over six million and in return became the chairman of the company's board
right off the bat elon began applying his experience from spacex at tesla
the company's logo for example was created by the same people that made the logo for spacex
and of course elon was quick to use the same aggressive hiring strategy he used to assemble the spacex team
this time however instead of poaching employees from boeing he was hiring from apple
before long the tesla team was working on their first electric car the tesla <unk> back at spacex engineers were <unk> in <unk> <unk>
while elon was promising very ambitious timelines
in fact his original estimate was to launch the falcon one in november two thousand and three just eighteen months after the company was founded
of course that estimate got pushed back and the falcon one wouldn't lift off until march two thousand and six
when it spent a total of <unk> seconds in the air before crashing down violently like for spacex two thousand and six was a big year for tesla
in july the tesla <unk> made its first official appearance and recorded one hundred <unk> in its first day
but like with the falcon one the actual production wasn't going very well tesla's c e o at the time was martin <unk>
and like elon he was promising unrealistic <unk> at first the idea was to deliver the <unk> in early two thousand and seven
but an escalating series of production issues pushed the release date further and further away
in the end martin's mismanagement of the <unk> project got him <unk> from the very company he had founded leaving elon in charge of everything
with full responsibility over both companies the stress was starting to pile up
elon witnessed the second failure of the falcon one rocket which didn't complete its only two thousand and seven flight
at tesla elon struggled fixing the mess left behind by <unk> and in fact the <unk> production would not begin until march two thousand and eight
but then things got worse in august elon launched his third falcon one
which never made it to orbit and then just one month later his wife publicly announced their divorce
both of <unk> companies were struggling to make a viable product and were running out of money fast
in fact by late october tesla had only nine million dollars left to fund the entire company salaries were being delayed and elon was faced with a choice
he had already spent seventy million dollars on tesla and a hundred million on spacex
with what little he had left elon had to choose whether to fund and secure the future of one company or to risk everything and gamble on saving both
fate gave elon little time to think the fourth and potentially final flight of the falcon one was approaching
on september two thousand and eight elon got ready for his last chance to survive he stood in the spacex control center in l a and waited in silence
then the rocket took off and the center burst out in ecstatic applause spacex had finally delivered a working product
the falcon one became the first privately developed rocket to go into orbit around earth but elon wasn't in the clear just yet
working product would mean nothing if the company behind it went bankrupt
in a frantic scramble elon had to figure out funding solutions for both his companies before the end of two thousand and eight and the timing couldn't have been worse
one of the largest american banks lehman brothers had collapsed and the global economy was heading towards disaster
in the midst of this elon was raising all the personal funds he could to save tesla he <unk> his few remaining assets and even got his cousins to pitch in
but getting investors on board doesn't happen overnight and december was creeping in
elon had managed to scrape together twenty million dollars himself another twenty million from various investors and fifty million from the german car company <unk>
days before christmas it seemed as if only tesla was going to make it
but then on december <unk> elon received a very unexpected call
nasa had awarded spacex with a one point <unk> dollar contract to <unk> the international space station
then on christmas eve the tesla deal went through elon had successfully saved both companies from bankruptcy
in later interviews he'd recall these final days in december in painful detail
ah but i remember waking up on the sunday before christmas in two thousand and eight and thinking like damn this is the closest i've ever gotten
and it was looking pretty grim because at that point you know we even though the fourth launch of spacex had succeed we were still running out of money
because we had three failures and only one success still not enough
and ah and then the financing round for tesla had not closed and we had only two days maybe three two i think it was two or three days maybe to close it before christmas
so i was like man this is this could be really bad end of the year maybe both companies will fail
so regardless of the struggles elon might be facing today it's worth knowing that ten years ago he overcame the impossible

on the night of november the twelve nineteen <unk> two hundred young air men set off on one of the most daring raids of the second world war
there's a target going do it
at the time we just got on and did it there
and that is our job
seventy years ago their target was lurking in a norwegian <unk> deep inside the arctic circle the allies had already attacked it on <unk> separate occasions
we were beginning to think that it really was <unk>
they told us and what this is the strongest ship of the world and it never can sink
the target was the battleship
hitler called it the pride of the german navy churchill named it the beast and he was willing to risk the area's finest units nine squadron and the dam <unk> to sink it
it never occurred to us if we were in danger the chap on the side of us may have been but we weren't
that day the dam <unk> should have been shot out of the sky
we uncover new evidence to help explain one of the <unk> escapes of the war
and perhaps for the final time key participants in one of the most audacious raids of world war two tell their story
we said to ourselves well we've sunk the beast at last
seventy years after the sinking of the battleship <unk> historian patrick bishop is exploring the norwegian <unk> that was its final resting place
it looks like i don't know maybe one of the ships plates you can see some riveting here so there's still little scattered sort of <unk>
ah of <unk> lying around here today of all these time
patrick has come to norway to find out how the r a <unk> nine squadron and six one seven squadron the dam <unk> finally managed to sink the <unk> battleship
this day is ways <unk> as <unk> day by six one seven squadron but it could be remembered in a very different fashion it could have been remembered as the day that six one seven squadron was annihilated
it's an enduring mystery why was it that they were able to get in there bomb and get away with no losses it could have gone very very differently
seventy years ago the <unk> was the greatest single maritime threat to the allies
at thirty-five miles an hour it was faster than any british battleship
it's eight fifteen inch guns could fire seventeen miles beyond the horizon it could sink you before you even saw it
its armor was so thick that conventional bombs bounced off it
an impressive giant worship <unk> was built to be as nearly <unk> as a ship could be
when hitler launched the <unk> on april the first nineteen <unk> it was worldwide news teenager toni <unk> was <unk> by the flickering images
i remember seeing in a cinema in new york where i lived and seeing a <unk> of this battleship this huge thing and i had no idea when i saw this with my girlfriend that said one day i might be linked the <unk>
toni was part of a generation who grew up with the romance of flying
every young man in the world wanted to fly they didn't hurt sometimes on a saturday night when you'd come back to the local dance
when you hope to go would say and what have you been doing today you could say well <unk> with death in the heavens
tony now <unk> flew <unk> in the battle of britain he then joined the elite bomber force the dam <unk>
in nineteen <unk> the dam <unk> six one seven squadron had breached the <unk> dams using inventor barnes <unk> bouncing bomb the squadron became the r a <unk> experts in precision bombing
a year after the dams raid most of the squadron had moved on or had been killed in action it was time for the next generation of the best young flyers
as the university and i decided that the air force really was for me i made the big mistake of saying that two and two made four i should have said five
and because i said four i became a navigator and i was not very pleased at the time because i wanted to be a pilot
i was a student and i was doing electrical engineering i didn't want to go into the army i didn't want to go into the navy and i thought the air force sounded pretty good but i was always a bit worried about my eyes because they
it wasn't really as good as they should be so i just learnt the lies that they were the bottom line or whatever it was that they were being lost and reel that off and pass the eye test
within months of joining the dam <unk> the new crews in their lancaster bombers would be fighting in one of the most <unk> environments of the war
after the german occupation of norway the arctic circle became one of the key <unk> of the conflict
in january nineteen <unk> hitler ordered his biggest battleship north to threaten the arctic <unk> delivering essential supplies to the russians
churchill promised stalin that he would maintain this lifeline without it the soviet war effort would collapse
in june nineteen <unk> the largest arctic convoy of the war thirty-five merchant ships set sail escorted by <unk> warships they were only too well aware that the <unk> was poised to <unk>
the possibility that is going to to put to sea is enough to create what can i described i think is panic
the rumor cause the <unk> to issue a fateful order
the convoy is to scatter that means that the escort this massive escort they've gathered is to return home and that his merchant men ah are basically on their own this is an extraordinary decision
and of those ships that set out only eleven actually make it to port they're sunk not by <unk> but by german submarines and and the <unk> who have a field day so without firing a shot
<unk> had actually scored an enormous psychological victory against the allies
this the biggest arctic <unk> loss of the war provoked a furious response from winston churchill
the destruction of this ship is the greatest event at sea at the present time no other target is comparable to it
with royal navy ships desperately needed in the far east the british threw everything of the <unk> including dive bombers manned <unk> and <unk> submarines
in two years <unk> attempts failed to sink the phantom menace
so churchill called in the dam <unk> to finally finish the job
they would have just two months to sink the <unk> <unk> before the onset of the arctic winter
if they failed the british navy in the north atlantic would be tied up until the spring
the dam <unk> were to be joined by nine squadron one of the most distinguished in the r a f
we were called to a special briefing up would hold sparked our friends base where um their wing commander flying man called <unk>
took us into um a briefing room which have been totally blacked out so we knew there was something special
and he was a fairly dramatic man and he enjoyed having us all sit down and then suddenly drawing the the cloth other model in front of him
which was of course the <unk> gasp everybody
the beast was hiding at the northern tip of norway well out of the range of a direct attack from britain so the r a f came up with a daring plan
we um were told to practise a lot of <unk> drill while <unk> drill was the procedure for getting out of an aeroplane if you had to land it in the sea
they were going to attack the ship by the soviet union
on september the eleventh the two squadrons took off on an unprecedented three thousand four hundred mile mission
they first flew the eleven hundred miles to russia
then after <unk> and at the very limit of a <unk> range they flew on to bomb the <unk>
in their <unk> they were carrying the new barns wallace designed twelve thousand pound tall boy
it was a revolutionary precision weapon in the right hands it flew like a dart
bonds wallace has designed it so it didn't tumble over like a bomb might it was dropped and flew directly onto the point it was aimed at i hope
<unk> was beautifully designed if you could say that about a bomb it had fins at the rear so that when it fell it went into a spin that meant it was flying very accurately
the raid would have such propaganda value that a film camera went along to record it
after a <unk> flight from russia the <unk> approached the target
i could see <unk> over the front of my lancaster and at about the same time i saw all the smoke generated start up and they had about two hundred plus so they filled with field
very rapidly with with smoke just my bombers say that it's no good skip i can't see anything so we just we just had to go
most of the <unk> plunged <unk> into the smoke screen but having survived this attack the <unk> was now forced to make a fatal move
in nineteen <unk> despite five years of conflict the crew of the <unk> was largely immune to the hardships of the war
historian patrick bishop has come to <unk> <unk> museum located in a former german bunker
he's exploring the daily routine on board with curator life on the berg
so this is like the your weekly tobacco regression yeah
but under the coordinate
what do we got
something different
ah my gosh i think we all know what that is don't we
tobacco and <unk>
um huh
two staples of the of the of the of the <unk> equipment sure
ah that is a cop for coffee from the ship taken out by some of the workers who was cutting the ship after the war
yeah so but there is an ice bit of crockery that isn't it looks like they live pretty well
the ship had a crew of two thousand four hundred men it was so large it ran its own bakery cinema and post office it even produced its own newspaper
was <unk> years old when he first stepped on board the <unk> thousand two hundred ton <unk>
we we we were young and we we were proud and and and the gods looked for our own nice blue uniform you understand
german troops retreated on all fronts and starving german civilians faced daily attacks on their cities life on the <unk> remained largely unaffected
we have had good food and clean rooms clean wash three days into it we have meat
and in the evening we have a a
but in october nineteen <unk> as soviet forces advanced into norway the <unk> was moved a hundred and twenty miles south to
it was a fatal mistake the ship was now almost within range of a direct attack
the news encouraged churchill to pile on the pressure
i consider that every effort should be made to attack this ship even if losses have to be incurred
the r a f went into a frenzy of activity if the lancaster bombers were completely stripped of excess weight and filled with extra fuel they might just reach their target
our ranges were changed and armor was taking out the one behind the pilot's seat was taken out their big piece of armor <unk> they had to reduce the weight so they took out the <unk> turret in its entirety
they took the guns out of the front turret and reduce the amount of ammunition in the rear turret
losing weight increased range but the <unk> needed to carry much more one hundred octane aviation fuel to get them to <unk>
the extra fuel tanks was a wellington tank
of ah two hundred gallons and a mosquito tank of fifty gallons one on top of the other placed inside the future large where the rest spade would have been
and it was so dangerous that ground crew had to wear <unk> because the danger of a spark they wore their boots and that was probably blow up the whole aircraft at least one perhaps several more around it as well
i have to say that despite all the fuel giants big family tight and there's no sign of any <unk> you still could smell that hundred octane
ah so it it makes you feel a little bit sick i suppose
on october the <unk> nineteen <unk> the <unk> <unk> of six one seven and nine squadrons took off on a thirteen hour non-stop mission
to succeed the <unk> planes needed to take the <unk> by surprise
they cross the norwegian coast where they knew there was a gap in enemy radar and they used neutral sweden to disguise their approach
everything was in place to finally send the <unk> to the bottom of the sea
but the one thing not in their control was the weather
just thirty seconds before bombing commenced <unk> was covered by a blanket of low cloud
but most people didn't bomb because they couldn't see the <unk> it very disappoint you all that preparation and all that hard work and all that flying
and to arrive together at the right time over the right point and then to be wasted is i won't say disheartening because we were just hot we were annoyed by halves
but after the failure of this raid there was to be no letter the crews were ordered back again
there was no time to plan a new route and there was one more shock in store for them
they said sorry to tell you chaps but since the last trip that we germans have moved two squadrons of fighters ah to be near the <unk>
in norway
ah well this made us swallow a little bit
we were a little apprehensive because of course we haven't got the military but
but new evidence has emerged that suggests the dam <unk> and nine squadron were in even greater danger than they ever imagined
in november nineteen <unk> the r a f was preparing to attack the battleship <unk> for the third time in two months the british was still hoping to take the nazis by surprise even though they'd be flying the same route
but new evidence suggests the germans may have been expecting them
on the norwegian island of <unk> historian patrick bishop is investigating a story that the germans <unk> some of their radar before the third raid
patrick has come to the site of a <unk> men radar installation the most powerful german radar of the conflict he's with local resident john ronald <unk> who was brought along a photograph his father took at the end of the war
hitler had this obsession with the idea that there were the allies even though they were sure <unk> landings have gone ahead he still clung to this belief that would be an allied landing in norway as well
that's what i was
i was told they though i was picking up all the ah the ship traffic going towards russia
now if we look at the this picture here we've got this landmark which is it's very prominent
ah rocky island just behind us and you can see with that in the bottom right hand corner of the picture um this box structure that's on the back of the scaffolding if you like is actually the rear of of of the radar set so that would mean that the
that the thing is actually the <unk> man is pointing inland it's not pointing out to sea where you might expect it to be
yeah this is very interesting because it was possible for the <unk> man radar to actually pick up the the raid as in <unk> as it hold in on <unk> to bomb the <unk>
with the radar <unk> to track the flyers coming from inland all it needed was one phone call to the fighter squadron that <unk>
in just thirteen minutes the fighters would be swarming around the <unk> ready to shoot the <unk> out of the sky
one of those crack fighter pilots at <unk> now lives halfway around the world in southern california
curt schultz age ninety two meets with a group of veteran <unk> every week
seventy years ago he wouldn't have hesitated to shoot them down
it's a friendship that has developed and i'm so grateful for that because i was the enemy
kurt started the war as a navigator on bombing raids over england
but later he became a fighter pilot he was posted to a squadron of fighter <unk> based deep inside the arctic circle he wasn't prepared for their relaxed attitude to discipline
i arrived just a few days after they had tried to kill hitler and you know the the the salute was like that
all of a sudden they all walked in and instead of greeting like that they greeting like that and you know i thought so but it was a very loose punch
as far as real discipline was concerned but they were very very successful
kurt flew <unk> missions and had three confirmed kills some of his colleagues at <unk> were among the highest scoring <unk> of the war
he had one hundred <unk> victories and i think kept there was a group command i had maybe a hundred and sixty
these three together had six hundred victories almost
as the <unk> took off in the early hours of november the twelfth from the frozen coastline of northern scotland the fighters at <unk> were <unk> on their minds
this would be their last chance to sink the <unk> before the onset of the arctic winter
it was cold but when you're twenty <unk> june area you don't feel cold ascent but it was cold if we wanted to have a pee some kind <unk>
in the mess at law see it provided milk bottles and of course they were little joke about those
looking back they just pitched us into it as it were there's the target you've got the weapon gun go and do it um at the time we just got on until it them
and that was our job
it was a long long journey there was no ah radio contact of course any way we could navigate i couldn't ever get any how was take the odds shots of whichever star was previous
and just keep my fingers crossed
at seven a m the bombers turned east through what they still believed was a radar gap but german records show they had already been spotted
defenseless laden with fuel and with two and a half tons of high explosives inside their <unk> bombs they were extremely vulnerable
we had founder of flying into a a gym clear sky which which is perfect for our job absolutely but then one little thought came well it it pretty it'll suit the fighters pretty well too
at seven forty the <unk> began their run into the target from neutral sweden
the <unk> was already receiving information of confused <unk> some placing bombers on a course to russia others placing them a hundred kilometers to the north
no one alerted the <unk> air base
then at eight o nine the <unk> on its own radar spotted the bomber force just thirty minutes away and it was coming straight at them
the alarm finally sounded at the <unk> fighter base at eight eighteen this was more than an hour after the raiders had first been spotted
six minutes later the <unk> passed a few miles to the east of <unk> on their way north
mine thought was help to christ the fighters don't get nearest if i got a one not one o nine up my backside and there would be a very little left i mean finished through this with his cannon
at eight thirty curt schultz arrived at his <unk> one o nine fighter had he taken off then he could still have caught the <unk> but kurt and his colleagues lost vital minutes getting off the ground
for a start the planes were at the wrong end of the runway and then at the moment they were ready to take off air traffic control allowed a transport plane to land
so tell that this u <unk> that was coming fly in had led down the hill and so there was another five minutes lost
just before eight thirty a m the <unk> began their approach to the <unk> r a f cameras were again on hand to film it all so far there was still no sign of kurt and his fighters
it was sunday yes i was was standing on the deck then came the alarm
and we saw the machine in south
as the <unk> approached they were confronted by the first of <unk> as formidable weaponry the ship trained its massive fifteen inch guns onto the raiders each shell weighed more than a ton
the <unk> guns had a range of seventeen miles even the big heavy guns could be elevated to reach aircraft
it was a great unfolding orange cloud this fifteen inch shell went off would have probably taken two <unk> out of the sky together
you could actually see these shells coming up they seem to come up so slowly it was a fascinating sight you never seen anything like it again
within a minute the rest of <unk> as defenses opened up on the advancing bombers
my combat station was the <unk> gun
you have to take a hat off to the german <unk> they've got the altitude absolutely <unk> ah i mean we were fifteen thousand around the feet and the <unk> was are bursting exactly at that level
but we were fortunate that they were a little bit early the the <unk> was in front of us by a matter of a few yards
when the fuel in a two hundred gallon tank is used up and that's when it becomes dangerous because ah a bit of fly get through it's going to hit sort of a <unk> fuel
how do you feel i must admit you you you're a bit excited and think fast i hope they don't hit us
i had to get that airplane positioned so the bomb went down she hit this target which from fifteen thousand feet must have took to my bomb ever like a <unk> toy even though it was nine hundred feet long
the first tour boy was released at eight <unk> it's called a direct hit
the next five record in another direct hit three near misses and astray
yeah you could see it go down like a dart almost because it was painted bright green yeah you and death it looked quite nice actually diving down there
it went through the speed of sound so what these poor sailors fit ah felt when two one two of them landed when the machine come are coming against you you have
you cannot get air enough it's so as one pressed you you're you're air
after the first wave of six bombers tony <unk> was in the second wave of three he attacked at eight <unk>
i bombed at number seven on number eight and i think i had a near miss or an awesome day miss i'm not sure i've never i can't go further than that
this second wave scored two very near misses the bombs were beginning to overwhelm the ship
the first bomb had landed <unk> it led to one of the magazines blowing up bomb four had hit close to a turret and blew it into the air bombs five seven nine and fourteen
had landed close by these also had a devastating effect producing shock waves that <unk> the ship's frame and caused it to start to <unk>
the first nine aircraft bombed in one and a half minutes that's ninety seconds you can count ninety seconds just think of nine <unk> bonds coming down at you
nine squadron followed up dropping their tall boys into the smoke as they exploded few were certain of the outcome
there was smoke up at the one aimed hospital since the points you'd think
that the rear <unk> was quite convinced bloody things going all the skip
as the <unk> turned away from the target they knew the danger wasn't over yet
we realize we haven't seen any fighters which is
amazing amazing luck
they were <unk> than they could have imagined the first german fighters were less than three minutes away as the last bomb was dropped
it took me approximately ten minutes to get to tom's eve from <unk> and when i arrived there the <unk> was already turning over
so i turn on a true back oh nothing i could do
kurt had only just missed the defenseless <unk> all the crews returned home safely was it luck or were there other forces at work
the sinking of the battleship <unk> after <unk> failed attempts was a remarkable feat of navigation flying and precision bombing but it had a terrible human cost
seventeen hundred sailors were on board as the ship began to <unk>
i i saw not the explosion from the hit on the ship but i feel the <unk> you have you you are feeling that the ship make a jump from a half metre
and in the next moment the ship began to <unk> it was so and so was it and and at last we hanging in the raining here
and i go a moment later in terms of water yes and then i swim to the coastline and the water was oil and
many of the
they have have their face in the water they were tied and ah it it looked i see that it was crazy it it it looks as as when
<unk> was swimming in the water a crazy sight
villa belt wilson was below decks when the ship <unk>
<unk> karl <unk> <unk> was lucky enough to be on shore at the time of the attack
he rushed to the rescue of the hundreds of sailors trapped inside the hull
as the tide rose the compartments began to fill with water the rescuers could hear their <unk> comrades singing <unk> uber <unk> until the voices fell silent
nine hundred and <unk> sailors lost their lives but the beasts had been slain
and then looking back it's quite remarkable that the raiders managed to get away with it ah when you think about it it's the defendants who've actually got the odds
stacked in their favor you've got the squadron of a of crack fighters based nearby
apparently with the specific job of looking after at the <unk> you got the radar systems apparently pointing inwards yet there we are at the end of that morning the <unk> is sunk
and the attackers have got away with a virtually <unk> now maybe it was just sheer good luck but i've often thought that perhaps there's another explanation for what happened
on the island of <unk> patrick is following a new lead that might explain why the german fighters weren't scrambled in time
he's meeting local resident journalist <unk> <unk> as a seventeen year old boy schoolboy <unk> worked in the indoor radar base for a german officer lieutenant carl <unk> <unk>
<unk> was a key link in the radar communication network on the island patterson thinks <unk> could have delayed vital information to the fighter squadron at <unk>
we understand that <unk> had sympathy for england
how how did he let you know that that he was in sympathy with germany's enemies
you speak very good
that's like a cigarette case or
or inside then then
<unk> was in the right place at the right time but was he responsible for delaying vital information about the raid
i think <unk> has a finger to stop ah sending up germany ah ah plane to take the lancaster
you you you may be right that that that <unk> as you say had a hand in the affair
to help support sender <unk> story patrick has been looking for more evidence he's uncovered a letter in the norwegian archives written by <unk> just after the war
this will he confirms this man's <unk> credentials no according to him he actually was actively working against his own people as early as nineteen <unk>
it's not just him he's got at least three other colleagues who were in this conspiracy if you like with him the germans had a a sabotage plan which they've got to put in place if there was indeed an allied landing and they've got a quite an elaborate plan here for shooting their own offices
and running up the white flag he goes over to the underground in norwegian ah resistance and they smuggle him out now if he his credentials weren't parker
ah i can't imagine they would they would do that willingly so ah he does actually match up to the description that were given of him by <unk>
so this new information opens the prospect of an intriguing new theory that a good german did intervene in a major operation of war on the side of the allies and had a material effect on the outcome
on hearing the news that the beast had finally been slain churchill wrote to stalin r a f bombers have sunk the <unk> let us rejoice together
for the young airmen of nine and six one seven squadrons there was relief that they had finally finished the job
we really didn't know we'd suck it until we got back to near base and they <unk> they they sent out a signal to say he's had been destroyed
yeah we feel feel marvelous really yeah i think it was called um <unk> beast wasn't it and i know we we said to ourselves well we've sunk the beast at last
there's quite an interesting experience to to talk to you about something that happened very dearly seventy years ago and i'm just getting little flashes of memories
i get to go a little flash of memory about the miss beer flowing freely wing commander in the middle of it drunk as a new
and a great deal of laughter is shouting and chattering yes absolute celebration who've been three times for the damn thing we were beginning to think that it really was <unk>
frank <unk> and basil fish celebrated their weekend leave with a trip to the london <unk> to see comedian tommy <unk>
i remember tommy <unk> making a joke about the <unk> and so we sat there feeling quite pleased with their self a still alive
seventy years ago kurt schultz nearly shot down toni <unk> in the skies of northern norway today the former enemies are firm friends
hello
good morning tony
hello
i am so glad i can talk with you again just one week after your <unk> birthday i like to church we got to know each other quite well and we have seen each other on my trips through california
tony was not too <unk> about meeting a damn german the pilot we were bit wary of each other ah for for quite a while ah but then
when we had a drink and things loosen down
it was a cool reception but we started talking and we became friends we never talked about the war we talked about all kinds of other things that were interesting to us
talk with you again soon tony
right
goodbye
goodbye
he sounds not too strong
this situation where we as human beings finally come through after the politicians did with us whatever they wanted to do and we think yes sir
seventy years on the raid that finally sank the <unk> is still considered one of the outstanding achievements of aerial warfare
i think it was very well planned very well executed and ah to solve those big bombs in this closed circle around and on the ship
was an accomplishment
yeah
but so thousand germans died so that's something we have to consider too
crazy war
for nothing
eight years of my life
it was pretty tough once but no it's all gone
it's rather rather like the words at the ceremony of the <unk> isn't it you know they shall not grow old it's a stick seeing the photo bit yeah
after a cold war is dreadful i do really i mean if it came again we'd have to do the same again
he couldn't have the nazis in charge could he no way
no way
saint peter's basilica in the vatican city in rome the cathedral on saint peter's square is a magnificent edifice capped with larger than life statues of the apostles
it's the most impressive monuments of the renaissance with <unk> reminiscent of the temples of antiquity
saint peter's is the largest church in the world yet its construction would have been impossible just a few generations before
no one had the knowledge of mathematics physics and structural engineering needed to plan and organize such a vast project
then in the mid sixteenth century artists and scholars stepped onto the stage and managed to do things that seemed impossible for the previous thousand years
within just four generations they <unk> the knowledge necessary to carry out massive projects such as saint peter's
europe was transformed under the influence of individuals like michelangelo <unk> man of extraordinary accomplishment and <unk> who found ways to bring seemingly impossible ideas to life
their achievements still resonate today
but how did they do this what was the secret of an age when the world seemed to undergo a paradigm shift the age of the renaissance
rome fifteen <unk>
perhaps one man stood out above all michelangelo <unk> project manager architect and artist on the construction site for saint peter's
although he was in his early seventies by this time he was still driven by ambition
michelangelo was a painter sculptor and architect a scientist <unk> and a genius but we now refer to as a renaissance man
one of his works would become the icon of an entire era
michelangelo's david is perhaps the best known sculptor in art history
men like michelangelo with the managers of an era in which art and culture knowledge and technology developed at near lightning speed
florence fifteen o one michelangelo astonished his contemporaries with works that seem to border on the miraculous
he set out to carve david from a twelve ton block of marble a seat at which two sculptors before him had failed
michelangelo became obsessed with the undertaking and spent three years working non stop on the <unk> tall statue the first monumental sculpture of the high renaissance
from the cumbersome block of marble michelangelo's hammer and chisel revealed the human figure in the post of god
the image of mankind changed in the renaissance
pope innocent the third said at the end of the twelfth century that man was <unk> formed of slime and ashes a contemptible creature the medieval belief that the sinful nature of man was visible in his appearance
during the renaissance we can see how this pessimistic view had become tiresome the idea arose that man was almost like god man was god's creation endowed with reason and with strength and created in his image
man could almost become a god
some ten years after he completed david michelangelo finished his figure of moses for the tomb of pope julius the second
larger than life this moses is an angry prophet with bulging veins and a fearsome <unk> the way gods were depicted in the ancient world
michelangelo may have learned from the masters of antiquity but he didn't copy them
the renaissance was more than just the rebirth of antiquity
men like michelangelo created something new they took the techniques and arts of ancient greeks and romans and developed them further
you won't find a single art work of the renaissance that simply copies in ancient one the crucial thing is that the renaissance didn't just <unk> the critical spirit of the greeks for example they didn't just grapple with the science and scholarship of antiquity
it developed everything further the slight invented completely new things and toppled the ancient giants who had originally been his teachers
but <unk> <unk> one of the best known works of renaissance art
raphael's school of athens glorified ancient thought
and leonardo da <unk> mona lisa for more than a thousand years the skill of realistically capturing the three dimensional world on a flat canvas had been forgotten
the renaissance rediscovered perspective
it was a quantum leap for architecture which took its inspiration from the symmetry of the great buildings of the ancient world
the art of building huge dome structures had fallen into oblivion in the middle ages and was rediscovered in the renaissance but the renaissance didn't limit itself to art
the invention of <unk> <unk> also meant that men of business now knew what funds they had available the simplest fortunes of the newly wealthy flowed into the pockets of the <unk> artists
it was like an investment program for scholars and artists never before has so much been invented or devised in such a short period of time
new mechanical machines were created
and the human machine was researched in increasing detail the study of anatomy reached a peak
the first pocket sized <unk> were invented this also made it possible to track the orbits of planets and the movements of celestial bodies as the heavens guided <unk> adventurous discovered new trade routes
the known world tripled in size
there's probably no place anywhere in the world where so much was discussed in one big conversation involving such a large number of participants where things were invented in such quick succession
printing triggered a huge discourse that captivated large parts of the population
elites scholars
exchanged ideas and so invented groundbreaking new things
but what was the impetus for this exceptional period of history
what with the ingredients in this explosive development
how could men like michelangelo suddenly <unk> knowledge and techniques that had been lost for centuries
let's look back to rome in the first century
back then the romans were capable of constructing buildings like saint peter's as seen in the roman forum the palace center of an empire that ruled the western world
rome exported its way of life to its farthest provinces a dictated the arts culture and architecture of an entire era
at the time rome was home to a million people twenty times more than one of the largest cities of the renaissance london
but <unk> dominance was built on the oppression of millions of slaves entire peoples were <unk>
for centuries the roman military machine succeeded in holding the empire together
but at some point the barbarians gained the upper hand the <unk> tribes the <unk> and the <unk>
in the fifth century the western empire ceased to exist
<unk> kappa <unk> <unk> once the capital of the world and home to a million people fell into decay and the dark ages began
much of the knowledge of antiquity was lost in all areas but particularly in engineering architecture mathematics and physics
the ruins of the ancient world were plundered for building materials
just a few generations after rome fell no one was capable of creating anything remotely comparable
in the year three hundred and thirty the roman emperor constantine had moved his capital to the <unk> in what is now turkey naming at constantinople in his own honor
after that the empire splits into eastern and western half
the eastern roman empire also known as <unk> endured until the fifteenth century constantinople was the second rome home to more than half a million people who call themselves romeo romance
the byzantine emperors saw themselves as descendants of caesar and augustus while its patriarch was head of the orthodox christians
constantinople also became the repository of ancient wisdom
its scholars with leading figures in every field
the rome of the east was the <unk> of antiquity in the medieval world
no one had been able to conquer the city on the <unk>
but one seventh of its population with merchants from <unk> <unk> and the republic of venice known as <unk>
this affluent minority had a reputation for arrogance and <unk> and were unpopular with the eastern romans
in early eleven <unk> riots broke out in para the <unk> quarter
the emperor <unk> the first <unk> accused the <unk> of causing the trouble the venetian merchants were imprisoned and their possessions confiscated
venice tried to defend its people to no avail it was the stillness of the conflict that was to last for decades and ultimately end in disaster for constantinople
the conflict culminated in what history calls the fourth crusade
this wasn't a crusade against people of a different faith but a catholic war against orthodox christians
the crusaders laid siege to constantinople and on the night of the twelfth of april twelfth a full broke through its <unk>
for three days they plundered the city abusing raping and killing many of its residents
the collapse of <unk> its defeat by the west during the fourth crusade in its <unk> by the ottoman empire all played a major role in the development of the renaissance
many scholars fled to italy taking manuscripts with them and trying to instill new values and ideas into a culture they still saw as barbaric
it gave an unprecedented boost to innovation
the libraries of constantinople were <unk> with treasures of <unk> worth the collective knowledge of antiquity
as hundreds of scholars and artists fled the violence of the ottoman turks they took valuable books with them
the scholar <unk> <unk> was one of them when the chancellor of florence offered him a chair at the university there he also sent him a wish list of ancient works
this exodus of scholars from <unk> <unk> ancient techniques to the west marble sculptures took on a realism movement and vitality unknown in the middle ages ancient frescoes inspired painters
long forgotten engineering techniques triggered a wave of technical innovations
ancient ideas about the movement of the heavenly bodies were taught once more
science especially mathematics and physics experienced an unexpected revival after centuries of oblivion
the europeans learned from several civilizations they learned from the greeks and romans the arabs the <unk> and also from the indians the arabic <unk> system we use today actually came from india
but they didn't just copy they developed something new with what they had learned and disseminated these ideas through printing
there was an incredible flourishing of discussion and debate
florence in fourteen ten a city state with a population of fifty thousand the size of london and bursting with self-confidence
the italian city was like the silicon valley of the renaissance a <unk> of knowledge and a meeting place for artists and scholars
the ambitious plans for the cathedral of maria del <unk> were drawn up around thirteen hundred
it was to be the largest church in christendom bigger and more beautiful than the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and milan
a hundred and fifty three meters long florence cathedral remains the fourth largest church in the world but back then it was number one
by the time its forty-five meter diameter dome was completed it set a world record
<unk> <unk> an artist and architect began work on the four thousand square meter fresco in its interior which was to rival michelangelo's last judgment
but <unk> figures are lost in the heights of dome visitors below can barely see them
in fourteen eighteen more than a hundred years after its construction begun the cathedral dome had not been built
no one in the middle ages had the knowledge to solve the structural and technical problems <unk> <unk> took on the task
<unk> was an architect and sculptor as well as an engineer and an inventor
inspired by the ancient domes of the pantheon and the <unk> sophia he had clear ideas about how to realize the ambitious project
he developed special cranes for the <unk> construction new inventions that would <unk> building methods
<unk> machines were novelty of his era and were widely admired
the cable that lifted the blocks of stone was seven centimeters thick one hundred eighty meters long and weighed half a ton
years later the builders would receive the exclusive rights to build a ship with a crane on it the first patent in industrial history <unk> <unk> rediscovered perspective a technique largely forgotten since antiquity
it was a <unk> system that made it possible to depict three dimensional views realistically
using it he managed to put the building plans down on paper and rendered them visually <unk>
it was the dawn of modern architecture
perspective drawing also inspired painters and their works took on a new realism
artists took viewers on a journey to near worlds and renaissance paintings became more realistic than ever before
the <unk> of perspective drawing was a powerful engine of progress
the fashionable architects in <unk> competing city states particularly in venice milan florence and <unk> became some of the top earners of the renaissance
no longer nameless as they had been in the middle ages they were celebrated and <unk> elites
venetian nobleman spent fortunes on palaces in the new style
swiss architect antonio <unk> designed and built the bridge of sighs one of the most photographed motifs in the world
this new style of building became popular outside italy
the city hall in zurich is a masterpiece of the late renaissance a hundred years earlier the sculptor and builder <unk> <unk> had built one of the most picturesque examples of italian renaissance
the <unk> town hall in switzerland
the new style inspired by the buildings of the ancient world was characterized by symmetry and a clear system for the arrangement of columns arches and domes
architecture gardens and sculptures were designed as complete artistic <unk> the aim was to please the eye and please the people not praise god
medieval art was basically religious art
that's in part evidenced by the fact that we only know the names of a handful of the artists
although it was customary to sign individual works we often speak of the master of such and such in whose name we don't even know in the renaissance we see the creators of works being named
art became free from religious motifs and turned towards everyday life
and also described that everyday life more accurately think of perspective painting for example art tried to reflect everyday life in great detail extremely <unk> artist stepped up
and made their demands confronting the powerful who in turn then <unk> them
michelangelo for example who would even dictate certain things to the pope
in thirteen <unk> the black death spread out in europe
<unk> plague killed almost half the english population within just seven months and at least a third of the population of europe in the next four years
millions perished
it was the most terrific epidemic in european history and it changed everything ultimately even people themselves
it might sound cynical but the plague didn't just have a negative effect on the culture of the renaissance and the art
the wealth of the dead was concentrated in the hands of the survivors
and those who survived saw life with completely different eyes
some must have said let's enjoy our days and spend them in the best way possible
maybe they wanted to surround themselves with beautiful art
others would have wanted to square their accounts with god and do something for the well-being of their souls like <unk> de medici who built an entire church
the plague had a fundamental influence on people's attitudes to life
the imperative of the renaissance was live this life and enjoy it
renaissance art was a complete departure from the art of the middle ages nude bodies everywhere beautiful people in mesh tinted <unk> landscapes open <unk>
in michelangelo's last judgment the heavenly host to show nude and great anatomical detail it was a revolution
the plague ravaged florence only a fifth of the city's population survived the black death
it also changed how wealth was distributed and led to the rise of a new elite <unk> who became <unk> rich
families like the medici were merchants and bankers people who had been held in contempt by the feudal society of the middle ages now they were the ones in charge
let's go back to the year fourteen twenty-five and the sculptor <unk>
his patron <unk> medici was the first great sponsor of the arts
medici was a wealthy banker and a shrewd strategist who employed almost mafia like methods
he was one of the richest men of his day and his money fueled the development of art and architecture in florence
it provided the spark that ignited the italian renaissance
but his success would never have been possible without a seemingly minor invention that <unk> banking
<unk> <unk> was the simple financial instrument that involved keeping a credit account showing income and a debit account with outgoing payments
the first complete <unk> <unk> system can be traced back to thirteen forty in ledgers from <unk> showing government income and expenditure
<unk> <unk> showed account holders how much capital they had on hand allowing them greater overview and control of their finances
the <unk> were global players they issued loans and signed secure credit notes with travelers that could be <unk> in many countries the precursor to today's travelers checks
on taxes donations to the needy on buildings and on art
a host of writers scholars artists and architects were dependent on his money and they repaid him in beauty
the medici palace is a glorious stage of renaissance art it's hard to believe that <unk> instructed the architect not to make it too magnificent as he didn't want to rouse the envy of the other <unk> families
the <unk> also invested in this spiritual well-being they donated money for a new church the basilica di san lorenzo
<unk> de medici supported artists careers and sponsored something that had not existed before the celebrity
this celebrity arose in a sort of intellectual <unk> in a market full of competition where <unk> intellectuals creatives and artists of all kinds were supported by the adults and very well paid by patrons
these patrons in turn hoped these artists would bring their courts greater fame and status
for painters and sculptors hyperbole soon became just as important as skill
in this very competitive arena they acquired fame and status and we still know their names today
but that also means the <unk> artists the suffering genius was a particularly frequent phenomenon
<unk> was one of the first great celebrity artists of the renaissance
he was almost sixty when it came to <unk> de medici with designs for his statue of david the boy who defeated goliath
this his most significant work was also a brave one because <unk> david was naked
just a few generations earlier ancient statues were destroyed for showing nudity
both medici and <unk> were certainly aware of how revolutionary it was
<unk> david was the first life sized sculpture of a nude since antiquity
unlike other cultures and the renaissance didn't worry about depicting naked or semi naked bodies that was very significant for the development of medicine
you can't study anatomy if you can't depict a naked bodies
that was crucial to a different way of looking at people
a person wasn't just animated by the spirit and guided by the stars
he was mechanically functioning machine and organism
what was also unusual was its interpretation
<unk> david is not a muscular adult but a youth with a rather feminine appearance
and his <unk> <unk> but where <unk> get his knowledge of the human body
with the enthusiasm of the early renaissance for all things classical interest in anatomy was growing as well
almost all the artists sculptors and painters of the renaissance would have studied human anatomy if only from books and drawings
there was a flourishing trade in fresh corpses it was legal in many places and punishment for the crime was often draconian but curiosity often <unk> over fear
<unk> quite possibly <unk> corpses too as did <unk> durer michelangelo and leonardo da vinci one or two generations later
but even in <unk> time in the early renaissance artists were very familiar with the structure of the human body which allowed them to create new very <unk> depictions of people
men like <unk> will either <unk> talented scholars or scholarly artists
as fate with habits <unk> interpretation of the old testament hero didn't achieve the same popularity is another sculpture of the renaissance one that was also created in florence
at five meters tall michelangelo's david is a monumental statue
half a century after <unk> it <unk> the self-confidence of the new renaissance man
the explosive thing about the renaissance was that people became aware of their abilities and strengths in a new way
they unleashed an incredible energy in their thinking and actions in business and technology
there was an outpouring of self-confidence
in the middle ages nearly everyone was illiterate the few who could read and write were from wealthy families or men and women of the church
the people who made or owned books looked after them like treasures
a <unk> might only produce ten to fifteen volumes and an entire lifetime which made the books incredibly valuable
but that was about to change
to obtain a lovely codex such as the bible for example you would have to slaughter an entire flock of sheep and that was expensive
but suddenly books could be had for little money and reading became democratic
knowledge became accessible to larger numbers of people
more and more people were able to participate and scholarly discussions about new ideas
that's the only way we can explain how europe became the continent of innovation more so than any other
the scribes of the church hadn't just copy works they had also change them and <unk> sources claiming their interpretation as the word of god
that gave them great power
but the renaissance broke their monopoly on knowledge one of the most important <unk> of the church
an awareness of sources in the truth grew not least because the sources were now accessible people started analyzing them using classical techniques techniques used in antiquity
the traditional myths propagated by the church simply weren't accepted anymore
mainz fourteen fifty printer <unk> <unk> invention may have been the most significant one in a thousand years and yet we don't know what he looked like
his achievement was to combine existing methods of reproduction and printing into a single system
the handheld cast was the key to his printing press
it allowed latest to be cast individually more quickly and with greater precision
this marked the invention of modern printing
it was also the dawn of mass communication
information became more widely available opening the door to new opinions and perspectives
information also became valued in new ways as the printed word to precedence over oral traditions
printing was truly enormous significance and <unk> is the person who did the most important thing in a thousand years of world history reading became increasingly widespread
the great scientific innovations and the great religious revolution the reformation wouldn't have been possible without printing
the first sixty years after the invention of printing for the publication of four hundred different vernacular editions of the bible
at the same time the number of lay people who could read and write grew
more and more people now have direct and immediate access to biblical texts to the word of god
the people of the renaissance felt close to god they felt they were becoming godlike themselves they wouldn't have said that in the middle ages that would have been considered <unk> people referred to the bible and called themselves god's creations
god made us in his image were almost god's miniature god came closer to people in the renaissance than he ever was in the middle ages
but it wasn't books that made up the bulk of the printing <unk> business it was fly sheets and pamphlets
they were affordable and cost labour to or three hours pay
now even ordinary people could print a pamphlet and disseminate their opinions verses and drawings
three subjects dominated sensations and miracles religious instruction and political and military propaganda
illustrated fly sheets also carried the first <unk>
they could be an invitation an opinion or a warning
just like today's social media networks they served as a vehicle for the mass dissemination of opinions
the renaissance had fly sheets it had literature that was printed and spread very quickly it could be printed in <unk> <unk> and in two days time would be in zurich
information disseminated more quickly and was much harder to control too
the censorship of the church that dictated what was right didn't work anymore once the fly sheets began circulating
you can only understand the huge boom in <unk> in the renaissance if you look at the media and the fly sheets in particular
mass communication helped create that new type of individual the celebrity
<unk> <unk> who had painted the <unk> in the florence cathedral dome was also a biographer of the most dazzling personalities of his time the artists
<unk> also produced portraits of raphael and michelangelo but he was particularly taken with leonardo da vinci leonardo was unconventional and wasn't afraid to acknowledge his homosexuality
he was remarkably creative and talented but also rather vain
<unk> was the first to coin the term <unk> renaissance
he endowed his subjects with the aura that made them stars the shining lights of society
he created an image of the artist that hadn't existed before
most artists were <unk>
that's how they saw themselves and that tell other saw them but <unk> created the image of the genius the strange crazy man the artist <unk> to ideas
he painted a picture of an artist that seems strangely familiar today in fact he created the modern artist
the painter holbein was the first to paint a portrait of his family
star painters <unk> and <unk> even painted themselves the <unk> became the expression of a new self-confidence
and then finally raphael italian the first painter to sign their paintings a further step toward celebrity the great names in art suddenly became world famous a hundred years earlier it would have been unthinkable
the towering figures of renaissance art first and foremost leonardo da vinci and michelangelo with <unk> invited to court and paint handsomely
in thirteen hundred venetian glass <unk> invented the <unk> mirror its importance is widely underestimated but compared with what had come before its reflection was bright and almost free of distortion
most people in the middle ages had only seen their faces as blurry reflections in water
the glass mirror meant people could really see themselves clearly for the first time
maybe that's why they were more <unk> than their medieval ancestors
self-confidence and pride in personal achievements were no longer seen as sinful
humidity was out of step with the times
a person who held his head high and walk tall in the presence of god who saw reason as a special gift from god those with the new values
as a result of humility became less important as humans we're capable and god wants us to use our gifts in the world
what was the secret of the great renaissance artists this immense flourishing of creativity remains a mystery but their <unk> endures to this day
last year was the deadliest year on record for mexico
drug related violence has infiltrated all parts of society and all parts of the country affecting everyone and it is absolutely everywhere
<unk> was somewhere at the center of some of the worst violence in the country
our story was the influence of the crime gangs have their their tentacles have spread out across the country <unk> is a good example of it so we asked the police if we can go along on a police patrol
well the c i a's latest travel advisory for a number of areas in mexico but particularly here is don't even bother going if you are a tourist visa for that they say is that the murder rate danger levels so high that actually comparable to iraq
and syria indeed here in one month last year over two thousand people were murdered in the drag world
on this patrol we arrived at a village or small town and it was a
bizarre experience
we came across a crime scene where less than twenty four hours previously eight people had been killed
okay so this is ah
so this is where somebody has been killed right
so one person here
another one here
there was still a bullet holes everywhere with blood <unk> on the floor another has another that loser would easily to flowers and candles that had been left on the spots where people had died only just recently
the last of the crime scene is here and you can see ah the bullet holes from the shooting took place about eight in total so it's pretty big and organized hit
they actually went from person to person i mean these were actual shooting individuals to not just this but actually went so that they were hiding
you sure it was pretty shocking to see their families their wives their moms their sisters really traumatizing it was very very sad
there was a lot of grief and that people were upset by what they've seen and they wanted justice
they said this is not my first time this is my second this is my first kid they killed all my family in <unk> this had a conflicts on it's really bad you feel
i feel really really sad when we when we when we left
it's a level of brutality and tragedy that is very very difficult to get your head drowned when you come from a a society like i live in
something like that happened in surrey on <unk> or it's going to be in the newspapers all over the u k and here is just
something little next day i won't remember
you had decided to try and get to actually the people who make the stuff that fuels are all of the problems
we were taken up into the mountains to a modest house with a big front porch and now we are introduced to a guy who is clearly in charge he said farmers union or is open to interpretation
we aren't just arrive this has been worked on for long periods of time but contact have to be made
they don't know who you are they might think that your undercover american drug enforcement
oh just put in ourselves in are really stupid situation where they can kill us
these guys don't see themselves as <unk> they actually just seeing themselves as businessmen and farmers
the gun shot wouldn't admit to farming oakland but he did say he farmed what he farmed to survive
one of the first tales he told us when we start talking to him was about how he had been arrested but this wasn't an ordinary arrests three <unk> helicopters turned up this doesn't happen for just anybody
they may look very normal but they are involved in a very very dangerous business in many way they were a bit like the mexican <unk> if you like
he was very <unk> but there is no forgetting that this is a serious character and though this is essentially an interview but we were the ones being interviewed
i've been having lunch with many of these farmers and they are just really lovely and nice people if they had to kill you they kill you but ah you know they are good friends to each other
he made phone call to be allowed to go up into the jungle where we met by security guys carrying machine guns fully <unk> out with their faces with <unk>
they took us to the public field
after about half an hour of really rough terrain
we arrived into this opening it looked like the middle of the forest had just been completely opened up so that they could grow the poppies
so this is the poppy oil that becomes opium and eventually that becomes
yeah and all these field having these
<unk> perfect for it and it just keeps producing so it's brilliant crop and why wouldn't the demand is so high and as long as the demand is high and we know the biggest user is the united states than its going to keep being made
they know what happen when you ask him you know that with this they create
yes and you know that that create lots of problems
yes but
if they demand us avocado we grew avocado
it seem interesting that what happens here and what happens in <unk> they're linked but nobody thinks about right
this is what we have to do we have no other option
i remember one farmer tell me yeah i know that is poisoned but if i don't create these poison my family is going to die
speaking to them it was pretty clear that they considered there was a real threat from rival gangs coming into take their crops
if we don't have a gun to protect us they will kill us
nobody really knows how much money is made by the drug cocktails but this is billions and billions and billions and billions ah of dollars
and its nationwide it's absolutely every city every town every village in varying levels
a wider involvement in the drugs or involvement in crime it is actually perpetuated by this whole society where criminality is completely normal
we went to meet a guy who is a hit man
he explains to us in in detail the hits that he carrying now
you have business rivals now not cartels hiring this guy to take out rivals
if i need to fix something in my business and i think that my partner is stealing part of my money i just call this guy
the businessman he's working for a business women as he was keen to point out will actually ask for really horrible things <unk> co heads cut
it's a completely different level of the scale violence
he interested so absolutely no reason to feel any type of remorse and although he's quite pleasant he's pleasant to us he's very very dangerous individual
violence throughout their societies become the norm
it really is a mess and everybody we speak to doesn't see an end to in fact they see it getting worse
the problem is so big and so ingrained is it actually
possible to saw what after it's become part of of society
the crime levels and the sheer amount of money that's available from crime is guarantee that mexico's gonna suffer for a very very long time
i'm <unk> <unk> and the like to share with you some of my most memorable moments at the <unk>
it's game twenty-four against <unk> <unk> the world championship match nineteen <unk> in seville spain i was trailing
twelve to eleven before the last game and as a world champion i had my last chance to retain the title by beating <unk> in this game four who forgave twenty-four i was not rushing from the beginning i tried to play a very quiet <unk> game
waiting for carbs mistakes and the game was adjourned to be resumed next day
and the position that you could see now it's hard to assess i still don't know what it's winning for white or its draw i would say it's fifty fifty white has an extra pawn as you could see but they're all <unk> on the same side
a limited number of pieces so it's very difficult to actually find any winning plan for white
next day when i showed up at this stage i was a couple of minutes earlier i have to say that with my coaches we have been analyzing this but we couldn't find any decisive ideas and then i saw <unk> entering the stage
that was the crucial moment because i could look at his eyes i could look at his body and he looked doomed
i could immediately understand that he didn't believe he could defend this position and that's everything it's about your confidence that you can either win or defend and that will makes all the difference for the outcome of the game
so <unk> played g six and i was waiting just playing some unimportant moves queen c five queen f seven even if these moves are unimportant it adds chances that he will make a mistake and after h four <unk> made a decisive mistake
just amazing because after the <unk> he had time to analyze this position home and and this move it fixes the pawn structure but the problem is now white can exchange queens and because these <unk> are fixed is two weaknesses black position will be lost
and eventually i proved my position by threatening to change queens and pushed pushed and pushed and eventually won the game
so ah that's one of the clearest moments where he could see the translation of your psychological weakness into serious mistakes at the <unk>
it is another memorable moment very painful one i have to admit nineteen <unk> the final match for a grand <unk> rapid blitz chess that i played against <unk> <unk>
i think i have emphasized as a <unk> game so it's a five minutes chess it's not about making long-term calculations this moves played by instincts
we probably blitz games the first one i was almost losing but managed to escape and that's the last decisive game i played was black totally <unk> him as you could look at the position black has two <unk> with me and precise two extra <unk>
and total domination in the center so i don't know which move is not winning you know if you don't make a move you're still winning but i wanted just to exchange wins and of course you can take with a knight here and then after exchange of queens it's an <unk> with two extra <unk>
i think that most likely <unk> have resigned if i just take with a knight on this three but suddenly i thought you know white took the knight if i don't get me the same by exchanging queens by taking who's queen
the problem is that white does not have there is not forced to take a queen all of a sudden has a move queen takes d four and instead of having winning position black now is lost because my queen is attacked
my <unk> is attacked my bishop is attacked and there's nothing i can do about it
so that's one of the more blunders i mean i couldn't see my face i could imagine this one the hundreds of hundreds of images showing my color frustration
<unk> sam it cost me the victory the final but also it's kind of a a memory score so it's just it's something that is just it's it's ah sitting there so um
even about twenty years later i cannot look at this position without some sort of pain
another very memorable and very painful moment
it's a last game of my ah famous <unk> against deep blue in nineteen <unk> because i won the first one nineteen <unk> the match was a tie each side one one game with three draws played with black pieces
and i missed my chances game four and five and i i wasn't sure when i started the game and i picked up the line that i never played before
but that was my hope that since i never played it before and it was not part of my opening repair to our that computer would not be ready
and i play in this position very risky to be precise bad move h six attacking the knife and provoking white to sacrifice a piece which is very strong it's maybe not winning but gives white a very strong initiative
but machines don't sacrifice the piece for a pawn without having a concrete outcome inside
so i expected that computer would go back on e four because this move was not in the special database prepared by grand master team that worked with deep blue
and to my horror the blue immediately took one and six which meant that the move was already put in
i just couldn't play this game position was pretty dangerous and bad but you know i lost it in a few moves because i was shocked by the fact that i just made such <unk>
i found out later too many years later that i was right on both counts one is that machines didn't play such moves it was just against machines logic and that was admitted by the deep blue team
saying deep blue would have never made this move unless that very morning they decided to install this opening position in the opening book maybe it's the most famous game in the history of chess if you look at the sheer numbers who followed it
many people believed it was a watershed moment where machines ah established its dominance over human players now of course the features app on your mobile phone today is stronger than deep blue
this is arguably most important game in my life game twenty four against <unk> <unk> me now second match nineteen <unk>
i was leading twelve to eleven before the last game and <unk> had to win to ah retain his title
and as you could see he achieved very promising position it's a white concentration on the <unk> its menacing and white has quite a few options one is just it's i should always watch a five as the as a breakthrough
another one is a little more subtle to play a bishop d four just exchanging the bishop that is one of the key defenders of blacks king kind of like goes e five then he takes now because of the attack on f seven i have to take was a knight
but then queen actually changes its direction attacking h seven point
so there are many options for white and it seems that black had nothing to do to improve his position
here after long thought i found one of the most difficult moves in my life and at first sight is a paradox because you don't want to put your <unk> in such an ugly position as e seven
but that's something that you have to do instead of <unk> pushing on the <unk> the game shifted to the center and a <unk> and priority here is to defend the king <unk> here protects this pawn and <unk> boughs of white threads
and that's most important because if white initiative doesn't produce immediate results then eventually black can do something active
and i remember that's when i play <unk> e seven and carpet came back to the <unk> from his ring room instantly you could feel that he sends that something has changed he didn't like it so i actually began gaining even more confidence
your confidence is not only good for you but somehow it <unk> to your opponent and it undermines your <unk> confidence
and the <unk> made a quite move king g one i put another <unk> here which is totally odd because both <unk> are just standing behind pawn all these things but i'm just fighting his f five and then after the b one i even play f five
and <unk> took a pawn some i took on f six and then eventually i <unk> the pawn
game ended up with a complicated position that's <unk> had to force a draw but he decided to press forward because draw didn't make any good to him and eventually i won the game won the match and won my title november nine nineteen <unk>
you have to make tough decisions and you have to be able to resist pressure and survive after psychological blows and losses it's more visual character and with some good training it's not really hard to reach certain level
the difficulty starts when you are trying to fight for big titles and just to climb to the top
this parenting is hard mate you need patience that i have a lot of patience to deal with these kids i'm not gonna lie i don't have a lot of patients i'm learning i'm trying certain things that make me mad like i don't i don't like it when i tell my kids to do stuff and they do exactly what i say
like i want you to do what i say but i want you to do it how i pictured you doing don't do it the way you want to do it do it the way i saw you do it when i told you to do it might be confusing but it is serious to me other than my son he's super bowl of candy he runs all over the house

ryan's parents never beat him and they never even yelled at him he could anything he wanted and nothing was going to happen to him but he was an angry kid we walk into his house after school one day his mom goes ryan go clean your room fuck you bitch

in that time somebody gonna get a heart real bad
thank you very much good night
good evening everyone my name is joe <unk> but to most people i am known as who
who is actually my mother's maiden name
and the answer to my credit card security question
but joking at a side and i want to reassure everybody that i am invited here tonight
i grew up in china who didn't
and my childhood memories are totally ruined by my childhood
when i was in elementary school as part of the curriculum i had to work in a rice paddy right next to a quarry where they used explosives to break rocks
and that is where i learned that a light travels faster than sound
which is almost as slow as a flying rock
my dad was a grumpy guy but occasionally he would try to cheer me up with jokes but he doesn't do it right when i was seven one day he said to me hey son why is tofu
better than centralized socialist economy
so five minutes later i said why
he said because i said so
i came to the united states in when i was twenty-four ah to study at rice university in texas
that wasn't a joke
until now
and i was driving a used a car with a lot of bumper stickers that impossible to peel off and one of them said if you don't speak english go home
and i didn't notice for two years
and like many other immigrants ah we wanted our son to become the president of this country and we try tried to make him a <unk> now chinese at home and english in the public
which is really tough to do because ah many times as i have to say to him in public hey listen if you don't speak english go home
and he would say to me hey dad why do i have to learn two languages i said sun once you become the president of the united states you are going to have to sign legislative bills in english
and talk to debt collectors in chinese
when i graduated from rice i decided to stay in the united states because in china i can't do that thing the thing i do best here being ethnic
and in order for me to become a u s citizen i had to take ah american history lessons where they asked us questions like who is benjamin franklin we are like ah
the reason our convenience store gets robbed
what's the second amendment really like ah
the reason our convenience store gets robbed
what is roe versus wade we're like ah two ways of coming to the united states
later on
i read so much about american history that i started to harbor white goat
and in america they say all men are created equal but after birth it kind of depends on the parents income or education or health care
i read in men's health magazine that president obama every week has ah two <unk> days and four <unk> days
you see i don't have to exercise because i have health insurance
i live in massachusetts now where we have universal health care then we elected scott brown
talk about mixed messages
i think there was a movie about him it is called kill bill
i am honored to ah meet vice president joe biden here tonight ah i actually read your autobiography today i see you
i think the book is much better
they should have got passed brass pitt brad pitt you know or even angelina <unk>
so ah i to be honest i was honored to be here tonight and i have prepared for months ah for tonight show and i showed the white house by jokes about president obama and that is when he decided not to come
and he started to talk about immigration reforms
take that stephen colbert
and president obama has always been accused of being too soft but he was conducting two wars and they can still gave him the nobel peace prize
and he accepted it
you can't be more badass than that
well actually i am thinking the only way you can be more badass than that is if you take the nobel peace prize money and give it to the military
we have many distinguished journalist is here tonight journalist here tonight who i consider as matt <unk>
because i used to write for our campus newspaper
i think journalism is the last refuge for <unk>
only in the newspaper can you say things like i was born in the year of the horse
and that is why i am in this year
my point exactly
and ah tonight is my first time at <unk> which is a channel i obviously always watch
when i couldn't stand the ah <unk> and <unk> of p b s and q v c
if i can still fall asleep after watching <unk>
there is <unk> two and <unk> three
so i became a u s citizen in two thousand eight um which i am really happy about thank you very much ah
america is number one
that's true cause we won the world series every year
after becoming a u s citizen and ah i immediately registered to vote for obama and biden
you are welcome
you had me at yes we can
that was their slogan
so after getting obama and biden elected i felt this power trip
and i started to think maybe i should run for president myself well i have to take a step back and explain a little bit because ah
i had always been a <unk> pessimistic guy
i felt that ah life is kind of like peeing into the snow on a dark winter night
you probably made a difference but it is really hard to tell
but now we have a president who is half black half white it just gives me a lot of hope because i am half not black in half not white
two negatives make a positive
ah you may be saying hey what would be your campaign slogan you see i spent ten years in the past decade
oh you're two okay
so i understand that the american people are suffering so my campaign slogan will be who cares
if elected i will make same sex marriage not only legal but required
that will get me the
you see i am married now but i used to be really scared about marriage i was like wow fifty percent of all marriages end up lasting forever
and i will eliminate unemployment in this country by reducing the productivity of the american workforce
so two people will have to do the work of one
just like the president and the vice president
or the <unk> twins
and despite our disease of cancer most americans die of natural causes so if elected i will find a cure for natural causes
you seemed to like that one
but you won't be covered by health insurance though
because of ah preexisting conditions
and i have a quick solution for global warming i will switch from <unk> to celsius
it was one hundred degrees not forty
you are very welcome you are very welcome
and ah i agree with foreign policy because i am from china and i can see russia from my backyard
i believe that <unk> is too expensive and open dialogue is too slow so if elected i will go with text messaging
i will text our allies just to say hi
and text our enemies when they are driving
o m g you are building a nuclear weapon
but you were doing it wrong l o l
i just want to thank video t v correspondence david daniel for having me here tonight and this is the first time i wish my son knew what i was doing thank you so much and have a very good night
so this is exactly what we was we're talking about
like a room for us even inactive just yet and
no damage done by res but he is done enough here simple and flame out to find a way window surrounds but there could be cities anywhere
mister mark at this point is simple may just want to take some c <unk> out
we're not able to pick more weapons up oh my god that's ridiculous from simple how on earth has he done that
one versus three
playing it a ton of time it means though it's simple with a
so even though he's planted this down an a k i might give them a shout on this
he only has
got to get a gun nobody's got the gun and we guarded on six h p this could be brilliant
yeah absolutely could be the <unk> he's found that killed now he has armor and the bomb down
he does have some more advantages if the c <unk> not playing together even guardians h p this could all fall apart for face
guardian reveals that he's coming from i v low h p easy from
he's wanting out defense take a caught breezy with one
for the other he wants to do what he can't but he's in
this is incredible <unk> so far zeus with only one but this is simple left life
oh my god
what is that transfer on the third simple circuits well no way
mike sees he's lucky to get away fourteen h p
they've released a gun yell with the <unk> simple they have taken him down but they found him put in the stay so they are gonna see in the pictures just off the plane
fourteen seconds they've got to get out simply gets what we want to return jumps up
and he goes away from default because he didn't want to get naked he also knows what it's like
and he also knows he needs to actually get the first one he's got a chance
oh that's what we like from simple
the ground absolutely loved that one
whoa
it seems to be the superman purchased on a city science fast towards pop down this time edwards could be ready and wait in simple
this doesn't seem to care that he's throwing the <unk> on it right away and he is completely light them up this is unbelievable simple with the head <unk> from hell as he pushes inside it doesn't even take a single point of damage
something about this position of this a lose team and we'll see if this is any difference um it's <unk> try to get one just about now there's a shot there but their exchange comes in
oh simple is going to be stuck with a p to fifty my god what is that
two clips and he had another chance to finish it off but that's definitely done now as if he has not been good enough form to take this one down simple is just godlike sometimes
there's no way you can learn how to be that good you can't teach it you just born with that sort of talent
through the shadows into the fire very much
other drone is used and simple
i've got the bomb planted at the beginning overtime it simply doesn't matter when you've got sixteen k
now simple can he pull off a massive clutch
there's another one they're lining up for me trying to cut his way to victory there's another flag
he's actually all for a standard coach as well and can most spoil the party
simple goes astronomical clocks and we'll clutch the round out in quadruple overtime
that's not what we want
oh <unk> gonna exploit it with the two k
<unk> lying in the open oh the third come on simple what have you got
he answers the call to action next semester comes creeping up from the event but he sent packing straight downward
yeah it looks like they want to fight who's gonna be the first one looking down towards the fountain
he's falling back when they actually set a trap looking simple hiding in the corner how far are they going to pick oh my god
following it up <unk> one is good one of his own <unk> just one form he's in honor than what has killed him oh my god
the best play in the world ladies and gentlemen
sorry to say that we're melt well another grenade please for the love of god something they can stop
for that shot
i'm not even sure we saw the second plane
there's a quad kill and he's already to got one another one as well
oh my god
as well oh he's in loving it
he's laughing its way into the <unk>
bomb down and nobody dying yet for <unk>
so we'll see if they can find some luck in the pistol round now they're trying to get their way out <unk> gonna open it up love you with a good shot there aren't any electronic looking for a little frustrated with that clock perfect and he's gonna circle back around
great movement coming out as well just completely <unk> them
and now simple realizes it this is not gonna happen
looking for a little bit of a head shot but actually missing that one and now they're gonna try and hunt him down he just wants the x skills you can buy something in the next round
a couple of bullets before you have to <unk> the tank as switching out to another peaceful one <unk> gonna survive it
is the quote kill not bad at all for him but obviously not gonna help them win a round the ace in spite of <unk> do you celebrate or do you like crying in the corner there
like trying watches towards love be in this is sort of shots he connected on this time not so much case be done in fifteen no cuts as he is simple
in a <unk> great flash bang on both sides into the corner electronics not going to press the issue and conflict through long now they have access
however electronic is simple and doing what like electronic and simple do better
simple he's gonna send them home a s a p we doesn't even blow
top meet now we will try to squeeze out everything from big <unk> maybe a weapon
run boost simple trying to invite the shot trying to get information before and exposing too much of themselves
looking at two <unk> and connects up to now their weapons to collective gotta a man advantage as well forty seconds on the clock they could do with a little more
<unk> pushing through ramp again it seems to make sure he has that information that will helps to plant the bomb indeed simple it's got an a w p but there are thirty seconds on the clock
we gotta move fast boom indeed rotating through towards the wrong side next has to stop it
he is the only person that can stop this from getting really out of control a couple kills that's all he needs there's number one simple as the next guy
the boss with the a w p and now he's got so much to worry about and simple knows exactly what to do takes him out
and and what an unlikely rounds to pick up it's not over just yet however but they have a really good chance that simple on your defending already with three kills in this round you may have to get all five at this rate because
critically wounded four and that's number five of course it is simple with the ace as they started the round with fox ox and eagle
<unk> watching for any kind of a <unk> <unk> aggression i think he spotted some some of the bodies out earlier definitely saw that one but simple it's just going to limit everyone
he's just putting on a clinic right now three kills even dropped the bomb it just gets a quick one tap that is a very fast sequence to get four frogs
edward took him down doesn't want to stand in the fire this time at least so
slight improvement apex gonna get closed this time it's gonna challenge it and he misses this again
close range she gets a shot on apex
taking down n b k that's outrageous this is really not supposed to happen ladies and gentlemen
one hundred percent certain old great flash great bounce catches both of them somehow flame he gets away back off from the flash in the all these two this second at the <unk> but couldn't do much more scary and overwhelm as edward now
the man with the u s p toward jungle gets the first shot immediately followed up in the position by simple rotate
now unbelievable from simple
show the card oh a different car this time
on that side of the map and instead the rover toward b it's you still owe the weights at the half broken wall
don't jump up flashing everyone's blind they know they've touched they know this contact it you still owe
j c walking help was able to get the better of it not only that he's transferred to more good head shots where the killers from navy there aren't any
it's simple and one versus five he started at two he got a oh a head shot he's better show up
better late than never promised download a few spots another nearly gets a fee shot because they neighbor's thrown
but just barely j c walking steps back in behind the statue and they'll be screaming don't peak
play this together play the time a minute and five smokes off bomb but won't go for it he's hoping j c walking or perhaps think that he is
and make a move to his detriment as simple picks up always got <unk> seconds still to play it would be a one versus five <unk> j c checks long
doesn't fully commit to the shoulder simple knows he can get closer and closer but also toward the door is what the other player is currently debating exactly what was going to happen
fires and if it's a w p and j c walks directly into it it's down to a one on one
what a nightmare situation this could be one versus five simple of course it's him thirty seconds of play with it starts walking towards it
could be where it falls apart from that it's not gonna have that much time to get to the site itself has to start running
gets himself far enough on the site actually guarantee that he can make it running through long a oh nick he's still watching b
hate to be so far removed the disadvantage now as he does look towards a oh i love the gap matt sh just looks away as he crosses as well
simple considered it shoulder babe before crossing stables he's going to get the bomb down <unk> knew he couldn't leave be
because he knows that simple way every mind game available to him
and he's done exactly that on one versus five down to a one versus one bomb planted
and simple he's holding it close enough angle that the option via factor only way that as if it came up mid
if it followed simple all the way around the map it's not if he's going to get closer and closer simple sees it and simple capitalized
a one versus five defined map point to bail out navy
not even that much excitement over there i thought i'd be screaming there it is small in this place
tired of eating the same old food fancy a taste of some of the finest ingredients money can buy
a meal like this one would set you back more than just a few thousand dollars don't believe me
stay tuned to find out about some foods that are only available to the rich
coffee and baking oysters let's kick things off with one of the most prestigious <unk> around oysters unless you happen to be drowning in cash
these babies probably aren't part of your typical friday night dinner there are many varieties of this legendary delicacy but just one can be named the literal king of all oysters
the coffin bay king oyster grown exclusively on a farm located within a sheltered peninsula off the australian west coast
these wallet <unk> models come with a <unk> price tag of about seventy-five dollars a pop after being grown for six years rather than the usual eighteen months
each bad boy can weigh up to two pounds meaning they can have up to ten times more meat than the run of the mill cousins
their strong aroma and complex taste that earned them the title of the oyster steak of the ocean
but if you want to shell out and see for yourself you'll have to head down to australia is at peninsula
almost <unk> oysters are a great <unk> but if you want to get real <unk> why not throw in some <unk>
behold the almighty almost <unk> which will set you back a cool twenty-five thousand dollars for two point two pound ten
of course the ten is made of metal which has been bathed in twenty-four <unk> gold so it's worth every penny right
<unk> is usually made from the eggs of the <unk> of such and <unk> species of sturgeon fish
this white <unk> comes exclusively from the <unk> <unk> sturgeon which lives in the caspian sea
because the <unk> ism is caused by a genetic disorder <unk> <unk> are extremely rare nowadays
that doesn't stop the filthy rich from dashing their chances of survival even more by eating their eggs anyway
the pearl like eggs are extracted from the specimens over a hundred years old and are said to boast an intense nutty creamy taste best enjoyed on toast or over ice with vodka to finish
almost <unk> can only be purchased from one of the few select <unk> house and <unk> stores in london and did i mention it's commonly eaten with a pearl spoon
bird's nest soup have you ever felt compelled to climb a tree and chow down on an entire birds nest or better yet take it home and turn it into soup
believe it or not bird's nest soup is a major delicacy in china costing anywhere between two thousand five hundred and ten thousand dollars per kilogram
these aren't any old bird's nest but the nest of swallows and <unk> which are made from hundred percent saliva
that's right these birds make their babies homes out of their own <unk> spit and some culinary <unk> can't get enough of the stuff
when they're boiled in water the delicate nest dissolve into a <unk> <unk> which is supposedly perfect for <unk> yummy
the asking price of about hundred dollars per bowl can be attributed to how hard the necessary to get a hold of in the first place
<unk> must scale the dark and <unk> heights of the murder caves in malaysia to scout for nests that are ready for the picking
ideally after one batch of eggs has hatched but before a second after that each tiny feather must be individually removed by hand
i am somali black chicken chicken is the most unique menu item but have you ever seen one like this before
the somali chickens which <unk> from indonesia isn't just coated in jet black feathers it's totally black on the inside too
this <unk> poultry grows at a slower rate and supposedly taste slightly better than your everyday kind but some of these aren't actually eaten for their flavor
the reason for its <unk> and <unk> is that the bird can be traced back to japanese folklore of the twelfth century
where it was considered a mystical food of the elite its charcoal colored blood is also rumored to bring power and wealth upon those who consume it making it a sound after a good luck charm in certain cultures
<unk> are hard to come by in the u s so the asking price can be up to two thousand dollars for a full grown bird and two hundred dollars for a single newborn chick
kobe beef
steak makes some mean main course but if you want a truly premium experience there's one kind that will do the job
kobe beef these illustrious cuts of meat are procured from that to jim good breed of japanese <unk> cattle which are raised in the kobe region
the animals are so well esteemed that they live like kings their massage daily played classical music and even fed beer to induce their appetite
kobe beef is renowned for its superior flavor tenderness and high amount of inter muscular fat which contributes to its melt in the mouth qualities
all <unk> beef is rated on a marvelous scale of one to twelve based on this distribution of fat and kobe beef only qualifies if it scores between ten to twelve
the luxury beef market has even been tainted by controversy after numerous establishment tried to pass off a regular <unk> beef is kobe
with kobe fraud rampant in the u s all cuts must now be assigned a ten digit i d number so that it can be traced back to the cow it came from
restaurant tours must also carry a license of authenticity that can be shown on demand
so have a beef <unk> it's worth checking before shelling out up to three hundred dollars for a single pound of meat
blonde <unk>
and steak
for those rich enough to take up been there done that approach to kobe beef perhaps blonde <unk> steak is more your for today
this rare beef is considered the most expensive steak in the world and you can expect to pay about three thousand two hundred dollars for just one cut
the meat comes from priced free range blonde <unk> cattle and is produced by parisian butcher alexandra paul martin on his family farm in northeastern france
the <unk> price tag is thanks to the technique walmart developed in the nineteen <unk> to treat the meat
the cattle are hand reared and free to roam the forests and grasslands of the french countryside and only four killed weekly
each cow is then slaughtered due mainly to make the process as stress free as possible and keep the city levels at a minimum
the meat is then stored in a room and pump with a constant stream of air at speeds of almost seventy-five miles per hour
and temperatures of negative forty-five degrees <unk> where it remains in this state of forced <unk> for fifteen years
to see if it's really worth it you'll have to visit <unk> store in paris very few restaurants are entrusted with the beef and <unk> pays each establishment of a personal visit before they're even allowed to serve it
love but not potatoes
the potato is one of the most humble foods rap but not when it comes to the sought after labor not variety a k a the world's most expensive potato
these <unk> are so well regarded that they are even known as the <unk> of the potato world
why you ask firstly they are almost exclusively grown on the tiny island of none motor off the coast of western france and only about twenty tons are produced yearly
preparing them for sale is also an arduous process because they're too delicate to be machine harvested
so each potato must be carefully hand picked in step with all the added effort it takes to get a hold of them it might be wondering why allow but not potatoes are worth eating to begin with
fans of the <unk> up <unk> say the sea air and <unk> which acts as a fertilizer for the soil gives the potatoes a hint of <unk> and even a suggestion of limit
if you fancy love and nuts for tea you should probably know that they sell for about three hundred dollars per pound
white <unk>
if there's one thing capable of elevating a dish to new layers of prestige it's <unk> these fragrant fungi are some of the world's <unk> delicacies
and even the romans couldn't get enough attributing them with therapeutic and <unk> properties
white <unk> or the diamond of the kitchen are by far the best the anomaly white mushrooms can only be harvested between october through december
in the forest of piedmont and northern italy where they grow inches below the earth with the roots of <unk> trees which means finding them isn't easy
specially trained dogs or pigs known as tropical tours must scour the forest floor in search of hidden gems below the earth
scientists have tried and failed to <unk> wild <unk> meaning you also won't be stumbling upon any in your local supermarket anytime soon
these factors all contribute to the fervor surrounding <unk> and the value their complex flavor can bring to <unk> pasta and even for a <unk> just one pound of white <unk> cost around two thousand dollars
and in two thousand nine a record breaking single one point six pound specimen was even auction for an eye watering one hundred and fifteen thousand dollars
<unk> <unk> coffee
many people enjoy an after dinner beverage and if you're entertaining guests with particularly deep pockets perhaps only <unk> <unk> coffee will suffice
legend has it this highly valued coffee was first discovered in indonesia under dutch colonial rule
native farmers and plantation workers were forbidden from harvesting coffee for their own use and were left to <unk> around for it
as when they made an unusual discovery <unk> cats will eat coffee cherries and poop out the seeds are coffee beans without digesting them
after brewing coffee from the discarded beans they realized it tasted great too mostly because these <unk> picked only the ripe cherries
the tradition continued in nowadays vendors of authentic <unk> <unk> coffee can command anywhere between two hundred and fifty dollars to one thousand two hundred per kilogram
there are some controversies surrounding the unconventional beverage though primarily <unk> cats are nocturnal and don't have big appetites
which means more than eighty percent of cocoa or coffee sold in the u s has never actually passed through one
attempts to <unk> the process also means many <unk> cats are caged and force fed the berries round the clock which results in crappy coffee made by very crappy people
then <unk> black watermelon
after a meal as rich as the one i just laid out a fresh fruit salad is about as much dessert as you could manage
this won't be any old fruit though da first up the dan <unk> black watermelon
these rare melons are exclusively grown on the northern island of <unk> in japan an annual quantities of about ten thousand units
besides their <unk> dark outer appearance there said to have crisp flesh more juice and enhance sweetness compared to their overseas relatives
there is a lucrative market for decorative fruit in japan so it's not uncommon for dan <unk> to be purchased as expensive gifts
depending on the size they usually go for upwards of two hundred and fifty dollars but in two thousand and eight one fine specimen even sold for six thousand and one hundred dollars
<unk> king melon
even the dan <unk> is a bargain compared to japan's most highly priced melon the <unk> king
which is basically a cross between two <unk>
this esteemed fruit is also exclusively grown on <unk> island and is a major status symbol for anyone within else
spare no add one to their collection
in spring twenty sixteen supermarket owner took a more condition hit the headlines after he <unk> a pair of you barking for the eye popping price of twenty seven thousand two hundred and forty dollars
making them the most expensive melons ever sold but what is one of these premium fruits taste of a gold <unk> apparently they just have an ultra concentrated sweetness
<unk> said he offered such a fee for the melons to pay back the hard work of the <unk> farmers
and even less coveted buyer can still expect to pay thousands at auction japan's luxury fruit market isn't just exclusive to balance
and in twenty nineteen tag more <unk> raised eyebrows again after paying eleven thousand three hundred and eighteen dollars for a bunch of ruby roman grapes
which worked out at around three hundred and seventy dollars per grape
this rare variety is <unk> for its juice in as high sugar content and low <unk> oh and did i mention they're about the size of ping pong balls thanks to years of selective breeding
when they first hit the market in two thousand eight seven hundred gram ruby roman bunches sold for around nine hundred and ten dollars and their prices only skyrocketed since
donkey cheese
a cheese course is the perfect way to complete a meal for a banquet like this one plain old <unk> just won't cut it
believe it or not there is such a thing as donkey cheese otherwise known as pure and it'll cost you a pretty penny
this bizarre creation is only produced by farmers <unk> <unk> on his rural farm in serbia with the help of some three hundred donkeys from <unk> nature reserve
it's esteemed for its supposed health benefits with claims that its high in protein calcium and omega three fatty acids
getting milk from the donkey isn't easy because only about twenty animals produce it at one time
and it takes several gallons of milk to make one pound of cheese
this is because the milk doesn't contain enough casing the characteristic that <unk> it in occurred to make the cheese the traditional way
thankfully someone came a secret method to make the cheese but it comes at a price
each <unk> sells about one thousand and one hundred and ten dollars that's a lot to pay for literal ass cheese
don't you think which of these premium ingredients would you most like to try let me know in the comments and thanks for watching
hi vogue this is carla <unk> and today i will be looking through my life in looks
all right this must have been one of the first show i did for <unk> and i've been working with karl are basically until he left us last year and the funny thing about karl is that he was always so late
that somehow i'm actually wondering if his really passed away or maybe he's just late and he might arrived
fashion was always going back to sources that would be a few decades earlier the hair and the makeup and also the look of the outfit still from the eighties i would say
ah voila here is johnny <unk> naomi campbell and myself i am wearing a <unk> a very sort of splendid gorgeous a printed <unk> and <unk> wearing i guess
the same type of print that i'm wearing but she is wearing a dress <unk> style was ah extremely audacious you know
it was not about being classic it was about being strong sexy and even a little <unk>
this picture almost makes me sad thinking that johnny's gone is still a shock he was like a sort of you know lovely father to us
oh my god here i am as a bride at <unk>
it's pleasure always to be the bride in a show i don't know they still do that
but at the time it was a pleasure because it was like the clothes you know the sort of the cherry on the cake and then you know everyone wants to be dressed as a bride once in a while i would look like an easter egg if i was wearing this now you know
but now it's too late but at the time it was so fresh and romantic right uber de <unk> was such an incredible designer but also such a gentleman to such a pleasure to be one of the girls you know
next look <unk> so here is me with <unk> <unk> obviously out of fitting i always loved her brand i like what she does the like which creates
she's a very delicate <unk> person and when i was modeling we were doing hours of <unk> for each designer you get to see the clothes very early
and you see how much work there is to make something you know happened and to make something become a dress or suit or a coat
i like this picture and others there's a rays of sun both <unk> and me are very young nice
well this is <unk> again this <unk> <unk> just after the show at the hotel room i think there was a dinner after the show i remember the dress
but we used to do maybe twenty shows per season and per country so at the end of it four times a year there was no medium shows but there was <unk> shows also my god
a lot of walk fashion week was was crazy it was <unk> we would run all the time sleep very little eat very little i was running in a car from a show to another
you know there was so much fun <unk> that so much work this is nineteen <unk> promoting <unk> shooting in london and dress actually has something particular you know has pictures are over of myself
isn't this embarrassing would you wear a dress with pictures of your cell phone and this is so funny really i want to wear these dresses and maybe we can get it back
not ready to wear it but just to have it also makes me think that we used to work <unk> you couldn't <unk> it very easily so you had to do a very good light everything was about the hair and makeup and the light
and so we couldn't go back in a computer and fix it picture was what it was and that was the nice part about it because the creative process was always going towards as much perfection as we could
because then that was it we couldn't do much and are <unk> were very hard to do okay so this is not to look ha it's a t-shirt
this is the column of my first album i was actually wearing yes a t-shirt and jeans i would say but of course these pictures are from kate barry very talented french photographer
this picture is about simplicity there's almost no makeup no hair and laying down with my guitar there's something very pure and simple about the picture right
i made this picture for my album as far as i could from sophisticated world because i wanted to give another message which was this is all gonna be about the music
you know has such a strong image coming from modeling that i had to try to cut it off you know and to show something of myself that had nothing to do with makeup and with being glamorous
you know this is not a glamorous picture but i think he helped the album to make people understand that ah was a songwriter and not a model anymore
this is the winter olympic games two thousand six in <unk> you know which is the city i was born i was so honored when they asked me to hold the flag
and i'm wearing a dress designed by <unk> and i had to cross the whole stadium it was freezing cold and this is a dress entirely made of glass and metal you know
so it's like a sort of material that the knight would wear in the middle age you know what i mean the sort of them it's all made of metal into something very metal it was very heavy
and under this dress i was wearing like um pants and shirts huh because it was so cold it was the winter olympic games and it was outside but so cold
so i was actually happy to wear such a heavy dress and to be able to wear proper wool you know mountain underwear ha ha ha
all right so this is michelle obama and myself i think we're in <unk> she's one of the nicest person i've met you knowing in that time in that world which is a very warm person very kind
and a very bright she she did something adorable during that trip she came from america so you know the <unk> to give a present to the all the first lady
and so she offered me a guitar a gibson guitar said that was the best president because no one would actually think of me playing guitar when i was at the <unk> palace because you know everybody sees you only like a first lady as if you did nothing before right
so when i got a guitar has a presence i took it as a sign you know such a cool thing to do
when you became first lady how did your style have to change
well i i you know i i i throw all the <unk> away no i'm just kidding
on my heart pants you know off
when i married my husband of course it was about also honoring france
you know with the style i choose to wear only french designers not only to promote you know french fashion that doesn't really need it
but because it gave pride you know the french people to have asked such a high standard of beauty and of a <unk> faire ah ha what a look
so this is a video clip from <unk> <unk> and it's a song that i made the cover off and this album i made with david foster sits rolling stones songs i called miss you
and this was the video that i made with <unk> it looks very dark but it's actually a very <unk> video that has sort of slow motion in it the look was a <unk> a very simple black <unk>
the video was made by myself and a double of myself it's quite an interesting video it's a very interesting video very simple but sexy and sort of slow motion
okay this is september two thousand seventeen the <unk> <unk> tribute show some of the girls i get to see often you know i i never lost touch with naomi and helena <unk> sometimes i i send message to cindy
but i hadn't seen claudia for about five years or six years and just before the show we met on a beach on <unk> so i'm seeing this girl on the beach and i'm like this is claudia so i went to see her and she said to me
i mean we almost said in the same time are you doing the research
i'm so happy that <unk> had that idea it was so moving for us
and so emotional really and this dress was dressed very similar to the one i wore twenty-five or thirty years before it was that dress but short
two thousand nineteen the cannes film festival and is dressed by my friend <unk> <unk> for <unk> i like the color of the dress i like the suit of navy blue
red carpet are very special moment i don't do it often when i do it i'm thinking it's quite good fun this looks quite sober i would say
oh compared to some of the looks you get to seeing the canned film festival which is the traditional you know so it's great it's glamorous you know the only think i wouldn't do in a red carpet is wearing a red dress but no one ever does that
i know you disappear right
yeah i do like eighties work i must say since the beginning i liked that even when he was designing clothing for men i would wear a costume that he designed in a few years ago for christian <unk> man
they were very very narrow anyway a girl could wear them i like her the woman that the project the suit of the eternal young adolescent women very natural
so this is my house
no this is the cover of my last album that has no title the only has my name
and myself did the picture sitting outside my house wearing <unk> jeans
my guitar we just wanted to give a very timeless feeling with this ah album cover when i'm in my real life i'm basically always very <unk>
so you know when i think of my music i always think of <unk> image
i believe is not so easy to be simple you know and i believe it's complicated to make a simple image so thank you so much i hope you enjoy my life and looks
and see you soon
hi i'm emma chamberlain and i'm gonna be taking you through my every day skin care my every day makeup and my every day hair i just changed the color of it so this is a big deal and you know it deserves a little bit of light
and my dream is coming true right now cause i've always wanted to do one of these so let's do it okay so step one i'm going to take the nearest <unk> i have and put it on
<unk> face mask
i do this probably three times a week four times a week i'm honestly kind of somebody who just follows my instinct if i feel like my skin is dry i'll do a <unk> skin mask if i feel like my skin is gross
so i'll do some sort of <unk> skin mask i'm intuitive with the whole thing
i've had on and off acne my whole life well since like puberty
um but my skin really bad in high school and then it got bad again as like an older teen
and so i decided i'd go on <unk> which is a very intense acne medication i did that for seven months last year
and my acne went away
by i still have to maintain my skin it actually made me fall in love with skin care in a whole way anyway i will leave this on for ten minutes
this is a very crucial part of my morning routine i have a really love hate relationship with my acne journey um and there was good and bad moments
but y'all saw all of it you can go back and see any of it it's been ten minutes i'm washing this off
now i look like a newborn oh my god my eyebrows my eyebrows are very neglected guys please don't give me a hard time i
i really gonna do anything to them um
but moving on first we have this serum that has some sort of snail i mean according to this it's supposed to oh my god
this is gonna prevent wrinkles that is something i'm starting to worry about anyway i drop a little bit into my hand
i've always liked
putting it in my hands more than putting it directly on my face i feel like it always just falls off you know you always see people on like tiktok and stuff going like this
oh my mine just goes straight onto my shirt when i try to do that
i don't understand then i use a <unk> relief whenever i had a <unk> in middle school and i lived with my dad
he would tell me to put <unk> oil on it and that's what he did when he had acne
thank you dad for the acne tip but it's actually it was kind of nice growing up with parents that also had acne because they kind of felt my pain um
it runs in the family so i felt like i had this support system of parents that were like we get it next i'm using
it's so funny because with skin care i'm very interested in it especially recently and especially since i got off <unk> because i was like wait a minute
i don't wanna go through acne again so i need to really work on maintaining my skin and keeping it as healthy and happy as i possibly can
the crazy thing about skin care that i realized is it is so different for everybody i've tried hundreds of products
i'm constantly switching it up i'm constantly trying new things this is literally my favorite product this makes me look like a baby's butt on my face it's a hemp oil it's unreal
when i wake up i look like a vampire i don't know what it is i feel like while i'm sleeping i just lose all of my life in my face and i can't explain it
this product truly brings the life back to my skin i also try to avoid dairy not only for my extremely <unk> sensitive stomach
but also because i think that dairy does make me break out although sometimes it doesn't and then i'm like
okay so i can put unhealthy amounts of <unk> cheese on everything that i'm eating around the day last step of my skin care routine
sunscreen i just recently started wearing it daily wear sunscreen
please like don't be like me and start when you're nineteen and already have had too many <unk> to count on two hands you know what i mean it's just not good i feel like i'm probably <unk> from it
you know
whatever it adds personality lip balm this is huge
i'm like kind of addicted to lip balm and i have been for many years like i always have a lip balm on me and if i don't
i'm begging someone to let me borrow theirs which actually is not allowed anymore
and never will be again it's crazy that i ever did that now in retrospect um that really is some food for thought it's makeup time
i am a huge fan of a light makeup this is a tinted face oil life changing i i like it is basically acts as like a super light <unk> type of thing
so i put a little bit on my hands i rub it and i just literally like lightly
rub it in
but it's like so nice and light
i started wearing makeup probably eighth grade slash freshman year of high school because i became a <unk> <unk>
and we had to do crazy hair and makeup and i just ended up getting kind of decent at it then
when it came to day to day wear i never was huge into it up until recently
let's really make sure we're looking okay here see how nice and light it is though on your skin it makes you look <unk> and like it's an amazing product
<unk> i'm always trying out new <unk> because these under eye bags are not
going away any time soon they are in fact genetic
it's funny because i'm starting to see people on tiktok draw on under eye bags or under eye dark circles
with like dark eye shadow and i'm like wait a minute under eye bags are trendy now under eye circles are trendy now count me in
i like to put this in with my fingers i never i used to use a sponge but i find that it looks more dewy and natural if i use my finger
i also lip the excess product that are on my fingers on my eyelids it just creates like a nice light base for the things that go there next
i use powder early in my routine because i just feel like it just prevents from any <unk> in my face of whatever's going on here
let's not comment on my brush usage
because i literally just choose whatever brush i feel like would work best for what i'm doing i think setting under eyes forehead
and chin is the most important that i've found and under my nose actually too
so now we have a nice base
claiming you good makeup day sometimes saw it bad makeup days anyway whole face with makeup and i'm like this just looks wrong
but today's a good day so glad that you're here with me we're <unk> now
you know just a little light <unk> never hurt anybody
the thing that i've learned is less is more and that's because you watch a tutorial and you realize
you don't need to put the whole bottle of foundation on your hand to make your skin look good you know if anything it'll look works
okay
sometimes i'll add in like a little bit of a color like this
into my crease but i make sure that i don't overdo it because it's very easy to overdo it
my eyes can get over powered very easily so i don't ah i always try to avoid that at all costs
i am not a big <unk> person
so i like to take this kind of medium brown and maybe mix it with a little bit of this brown
this side is just a nightmare for me trying to get my hand
can you not
you wanna say hi to my cat what's up
okay you're gonna go back outside
that was fun all right okay if you keep scratching on the door though you're grounded back to work being a cat mom is not easy
take a little bit of this
rub it and between my fingers
just kind of lightly tap it on to the corner i feel like that really <unk> my eyes up
take a brow gel
keep um nice and fluffy and natural looking
then i take a little bit of tinted brow gel
the next few steps of this routine is is just out of order but that's the way i like to do it so bare with me
i like to wipe all the excess product off my lip
and then i take this <unk> lip cream
and i put this on and i let it sit while i do the remainder of my look so that my lips can kind of fluff up
i think that i could use some blush
this is the only blush i literally own
i hate the way you just smile when you put on blush
can you guys look away for a second while i do this
oh my god this <unk> <unk> is so gross
but i've had it for so long it's just the only one that i've found that i like
all right then we have my <unk> the literally is the coolest shape look at it
how fun is that
i love the like
<unk> look with like the crazy lower lash line
i really wanna play into that this year twenty twenty one is the <unk> lower lash line year
lip liner
i've always neglected my lips but i feel like they actually pull together a full makeup look and i've recently learned the importance so here we are
oh my god i'm done what do you think
now i need to do hair i did just go brunette
i was blonde for like eight months and i loved every minute of it but
ah my hair got extremely damaged and so just a few days ago i cut all of it off
and died it brown dry <unk> <unk> this ones really good this one has been amazing especially with brown hair it's hard to use dry <unk> because it really just shows up
dry <unk> also great because it adds volume like why not you know
okay i'm also somebody that's always loved to have my hair up in a <unk> or up in some way
and now that my hair is literally this short i can't do that so i have to adapt
the dry <unk> honestly like weirdly styles it enough to where i'm like satisfied with it but i do like to add a little bit of hair spray
i will just do anything for volume
see now looks good because i have to see my own face on the internet every single day it's made me a little bit more obsessive about how i look
but at the same time it's just about practicing resilience and realizing that you know
hopefully people aren't following me because they care about my hair color hopefully hopefully they're following me because they wanna hang out with me when i start to get too in my head the phones off
and i'm playing drums i'm hanging out with my one friend talk to my parents on the phone that fixes every thing i think
this is the final look i feel good about it um thank you for hanging out with me i had a lot of fun today and see you around bye
this is the new bentley continental g t now they all got a bit of a reputation for being driven by people who tend to play with these things for a living
anyway they still want it may end up being the same because if you got lots of money and he wants it it's really cool and stylish and fast you're gonna go for this now i love the design of this car so it's just so cool
these crises the chrome detailing the wide <unk> here at the back there are some people who have seen it say well i'm not so sure about the rear but i love it i like the way these lights match the exhaust and it's just all kind of sleek and squat and strong
and now on the front you got a beautiful grill this car is stunning the guy who designed this has created a masterpiece it's for me as beautiful as any constable so yeah
i'm not talking policeman obviously place i'm talking art guys talking art now this car is not cheap that it starts from just under one hundred and sixty thousand pounds now if you know anyone who is looking to buy a new car click on the pop up on the top right hand corner of the screen or the link below the video
cause you can refer them to <unk> and if they buy a car through us we'll give you a fifty pound amazon gift card
as you'd imagine the inside of this car is just gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous now the particular car i've got here has got almost fifty thousand pounds worth of options on it and <unk> thousand pounds of that
is the first edition specification and signified by this little number one with the union jack there up on the dash so increase stuff like the millennium park which includes diamond quilting the cars has been earning on the air events
and on various other bits and pieces such as the little organ stops its just feel quality i mean everything is just lovely there's a metal effect for all the switches and things like the door handles are actually solid metal i love it in here
i really do then there's attention to details such as the way the vets match up to this metal strip that goes all the way around the cabin i mean that is really pleasing my old c d recently the normally wouldn't for instance the stitching up on here
doesn't mean i'm the somewhat i can forgive it though i can't tell you why it's because this is hand stitched now this was done by a robot i want it dead straight but the fact that it is slightly <unk> it's kind of
let's you know that it's been done by a man obviously had been a japanese person would probably be dead straight but that's british that's what we like in england and it's a bit like john <unk> voice the fact that it's imperfect is what makes it so perfect
and the leather quality throughout ah just look it's so super soft it's not like a <unk> tailored feel to it there are a few things i'm not so sure about that so you've got digital dolls in this car and
they're really functional and i like what they've done with them they look almost real the way they got like a three d effect partly just want old fashioned analog dials
but there is a great functionality with this so you can do things like look at the the sat <unk> make it go <unk> connect your phone look through various functions and
yeah it's all good and there's a wide screen entertainment display which it it's okay to use it you can tell it's based on the system used by <unk> for some reason they try to personalize it make it a bit more bentley but it's
it's actually not as easy to use and if you click on the pop out on the top right hand corner of the screen on the link below the video you can actually see my full in depth review of the entertainment system now that brings you into something else because there are a few parts in here that's you will find in other v w products say such as
these switches on the steering wheel i bet a lot of those you get in the golf now journalists may complain about that but the fact is someone who buys this car has never been anywhere near a golf nor their friends there any <unk> you know is played at saint andrews or pebble beach
so it's functionally works it doesn't really matter and it doesn't feel cheap in fact all the switches with the metal effect like i say it's just gosh it's lovely some of these switches down here they're nice and laid out but it can be a bit confusing to use when you're driving but you can feel your way around them okay
and there is a decent amount of storage and here we've got huge door bins which is handy for your bottle of water down here there's a special storage area which i imagine it could be used for your cigars but i don't have any <unk> so i'm having to use
to illustrate that there is a bit of storage and hit the glove box is not the largest but it's okay you can put your expensive leather gloves and there is a bit more storage into their and this guy actually has a wireless charging point for your mobile phone
and then on the other hand there is some really deep cup holders i mean look at that look at the way that opens i mean the quality and here is just <unk> you know that would just feels great and even the speaker covers for this upgraded name audio system which
by the way it's so loud and the bass is thumping its almost like thunder it's so good that feels glorious everything you touch and feel is glorious however what's it like for people in the back this is supposed to be a <unk> <unk>
so come on yes that will slide out the way good shouldn't have to do anything manually in this bentley also the door
there you go soft close and it's got this little seat belt buckle up there so you don't reach for your own belt now i'm just gonna put the seat back i've never been in the rear of this car before let's see what it's like is he gonna crush my legs
no just about going off the room foot space is a little bit tight in the seat is rather deep so it's actually pressing against my car so it's not the most comfy back here in her dreams tight as well though my head is touching this beautiful leather roof lining
not only what product in my head it's gonna end up leaving the state and that these things are gorgeous you got your own rear windows as well which is nice it's a bit of fresh air in this in storage and cup holders and here you've got twelve <unk> socket you've got
charging point for your mobile phone you've even got some through loading if you want to carry <unk> in the back and look at this it's a bit unusual never had that before normally this would be hidden just but yes i can put it on ebay for about five hundred pounds now let's check out
the boot because yeah this is quite a big car but i don't reckon it's got the biggest <unk> i think you know it's a <unk> <unk>
but it's decent enough in size i mean look at that you can fit a large suitcase and there was a bit of a little left over but to stop your scratching your paint work there is a <unk> plate here i think it might be plastic but it looks like metal and i'll forgive it because quality in the booth here is really good
even the carpets here are thick and almost as thick as in the front and check this out for the twelve <unk> socket look at that it's <unk> now the thing with this boot is that they're designed to be wide enough to take
a set of golf clubs look golf clubs
it's quite easily now if you want more detail on this car is practical it's a click on the pop out on the top right hand corner of the screen we'll see just how much stuff you can fit in these cars boats and some other things as well
however this car isn't all perfect here is five annoying things about it
this steering wheel looks super lovely and i really like the large bentley logo since <unk> same then cause they have to ride air bag so big you gonna need it air bag
the surrounds of these parking sensors just took off there any properly there for some reason you can't get a bentley continental g t with android auto why is that because android phones are as good as iphones i think not because the new galaxy
s nine is definitely better than an iphone ten discuss in the comment box below i love the shiny grill it just looks expensive shame then that the rest of the events of cheap plastic mesh kind of thing that you find on the budget x back
when you're driving the light reflects in the shining street but it catch in the corner of eye and you wasting in a vehicle just in your blind spot don't worry there's still plenty to like about this car here's the <unk> five cool features the head up display is really big
and bright and very useful when you're driving you can show things like the direction from the satellite navigation your speed and the actual speed limit when you put the risk spoiler up manually it shows that you've done that on a little graphic on the cars display just kind of cool
i absolutely love the look of the lights they have been designed to look like diamonds maybe they're <unk> crystals that isn't bad isn't it definitely diamond digital display a little bit too modern for you
don't worry you can turn back time by rotating the screen around there's an analog dials and then when you turn the car off you can always just flip away
revealed just a nice clean simple wooden surface these are the biggest iron brake discs on any production car there four hundred twenty millimeters in diameter it's no wonder it stops as well
now it's time to hit the road to see what this car is like to drive
how fast can the car which weighs two point two tonnes actually be well we're gonna find out because i've got some special timing equipment up there on the launch this bentley
this is nuts
whoa wow wow wow wow wow wow
i've got to hand it to the brakes first of all i mean they slammed on the anchors that's good news the brakes are good but what about the performance
the stunning <unk> time is eleven point seven seconds and check out the north sixty as well it's supposed to be in three point seven seconds but what did i get three point six seconds
this is rapid so then why is his car so blooming quick well that's because underneath the bonnet is a six liter w twelve twin <unk> petrol engine with
six hundred thirty-five horsepower and nine hundred newton metres of <unk>
and i love this engine it is so powerful there's something almost geological to it in a way it's it's relentless and it makes the noise
ah what a routing volcano it is so good now there is a small matter of economy and emissions which yeah they're not great they're not great but i am actually <unk> twenty two miles per gallon
now that could be quite expensive but if you can afford this car you don't care about that what's more important is how far you can go between fuel stops and this guy is a big petrol tanks with that economy
i could go back four hundred fifty miles between having to pull up and rub shoulders with normal people at a petrol station i can't twist the dial down here and put everything in comfort mode and it <unk> off the air suspension
and then does a thorough response makes the steering a bit lighter and it's all free and relaxing and comfy the best mode there is a special bentley mode which is the best of both worlds between sporting us and converting yeah you took it into a corner
and it somehow grips and goes round for instance on a <unk> road now and
it's surprisingly good you see this new continental g t seems to just continue just holding its line where if the old one would have kind of just run out of talent and started to <unk> off the road it is genuinely good fun when you get the opportunity
that's right about a bit
that's being wrong thing in this it's a bit like driving the british museum and fast on the road
so you can do with total confidence i mean the four wheel drive system just grapes and grapes and grapes it's really really impressive
and you can send loads of power to the back of an israeli drive by so it feels <unk>
i mean yeah it's it's not quite as agile as something like a <unk> g t c four less so but i think it's nicer inside but i could live like this i could what a car actually i'm being very critical um
there is something i don't like about the driving experience and that's the real visibility which is kind of a letter box like that's the best way to describe it ah let me see if there's anything else i don't like
now if you click on the pop out on the top right hand corner of the screen or the link below the video you can get a <unk> dot com to see how much you can save on a new car so that was my final verdict on the bentley continental g t should you avoid it should you consider it should you short list it
or should you just go right ahead and buy it well you know what if i win the lottery or if i was a football player i buy it i love this car i really do

now did you spot the easter egg in this video it was the continental <unk> in the course glove box
the f r x and its sisters have got a lot of attention as the affordable enthusiast rear wheel drive car the de facto standard however the british pioneer this idea and the japanese were finding so we brought along
two thousand and a <unk> r x eight to find out if the f r s truly is the best example
and these are the two that you've asked for and we've had so many requests
i'm excited to do it but i am a little concerned i may have dug myself a hole
also what's wrong
well on the p c h <unk> i i may have said i may have said that the f r s is better than
i think you did say that
i think i need to so now i am prepared to be wrong we have them here i am prepared to drive them i prepared to be wrong
i think i'm gonna be wrong too i think
well actually you know what no matter how this goes the fan boys for these cars are so serious
oh that's true this is this is the wrong review these are wrong
whatever we say
this is about the only time you're gonna see all three of these cars unbiased by non owners together that's why we're here you've asked for it so let's go be wrong
so here is the same white f r s we had on our pacific coast highway shooter
it's one of the first <unk> f r s that were in the country and i just like this car
it's always nice to get back in a car that you remembered loving and it didn't let you down
the f r s is not disappointing me personally i feel like the v r z is the better set up however and i'm getting back to thinking i loved it but we were comparing against different cars
the two cars we brought along with it pretty steep competition
last time we drove the arctic for the show it was an old four this is a two thousand eleven and in fact the last three sold in southern california and i maintain everything about this car is just odd
kind of skill to unique the second generation r x eight is definitely more refined than the first generation
after having driven the first generation r x eight i feel like that car was more willing just slightly more willing than this car but what i don't feel like they've done is completely taken away that fun to drive that just
brilliant enthusiasm so this car represents the most sorted best example of the r x eight
of course there's two versions of the <unk> s two thousand and they are much debated the a p one and a p two this is the a p two if you want to go with the a p one version with a higher <unk> and a little bit more tail happy suspension
that you can get them cheaper put in is a key to the definitely refined the cocked hat of course you're buying one of the most reliable source supper made the guy that owns this guy almost eighty thousand miles on it is never done anything more than standard maintenance
what's great is you've got that nearly bulletproof nature of <unk> cars you don't have to worry about beating on this thing now the car we're driving today is the car we drove in our stand alone on s two thousand review so driving it later
it's got of course more miles and it still feels fresh i'm sad to say these guys are no longer the market and it's also a tragedy that <unk> is building things like the <unk> parameter i mean the hand across to her
getting right out of the other cars in the f r s is truly revealing i wasn't thinking that the f r s needed more power i thought it was fine
i'm wrong about them in spite of being the least powerful the f r s is actually be easier to launch little also runs out of breath the fastest running about about five thousand r p m to put your foot to the floor
you expect that extra little surge when he meant the gas and it just doesn't happen here i am stepping on the throttle and i feel like the f r s is holding something back
and that feeling isn't that it's holding something back it just doesn't have any more to give
now this s two thousand has the forty more horsepower that we wish we had them in f r s
but has almost the exact same tour
so because of a horse the much loved <unk> v tech engine you got a rather pretty high to find the power in this car
there's enough there i'm not wanting for power and as hard as you can read the it's just it constant surge
and you feel that b tag <unk> run about six thousand r p ms and it give you the actual kick in the ass when the f r s is just dying away in two thousand is a second faster zero to sixty than the f r s
i mean that's pretty much the only stat you need to know to remind you that the f r s is just under power
the r x eight also has the missing ingredients the f r s does not more power
and this engine in spite of the fact that it's a typical in spite of the fact that its reputation is not all that reliable it's so <unk> smooth it feels like somehow this engine is better <unk> and better built than anything you've ever driven
there's no vibration just sings up through the r p f headed toward its nine thousand r p m <unk> however even though the r x eight is more powerful in the f r s doesn't actually feel like it
it's not really any faster it like the f r s never gives me as much as i expect
the r x eight makes great power you're just gonna not think that it does anywhere below five thousand r p m
you've gotta grab this car by the <unk> of the neck smack it around and make your bitch otherwise you're not gonna be smiling once you do you will be happy
now i will acknowledge that for every person you hear about who's going a hundred fifty thousand miles on their first rotary engine there's the guy next to him with an r x eight done three engines in two hundred fifty thousand miles the big trick is these engines burn a lot of gas
and they burn a lot of oil just during the hard driving of the shoot we've burned almost a half quarter of oil
now what's interesting about all three of these cars is they've got electric power steering
for all the complaints that are happening right now for poor electric steering <unk> in cars each of these three cars have electric power steering and all of them get it right
so famous associated electric power steering with something that doesn't feel right when you're driving a field goal or have good steering feedback you're completely wrong
now the steering on the r x eight doesn't feel quite a sure what's nice is the hardest to push this car the better you get
to compare the r x eight <unk> to most cars it's probably going to win it is a very informative steering rack but it feels larger and more disconnected than the other two cars
if you think the handling on the r x eight is not you ought to have your head examined i would say the steering feels slightly muted but it doesn't feel now
this is so strange i can feel the longer <unk> but a plants itself so well
now this r three makes a far more aggressive it's got a <unk> suspension and in fact this car has the longest <unk> but the worst cried on the highway it just kind of <unk> in puffs as you go along north normal highway speeds
even in this company the f r s is incredibly easy car to drive very fast now force they can't get up to speed is found but what's your their biscuit hang on to speak in corners almost better than the other two
for the better side tires on a <unk> gripped them both but the great thing is this just tells you so much about what's going on better give you a lot of confidence partly because the limits in the forest alone on that you could approach them safely and you can feel them coming
some ways the effort as like having a really good navigator they're telling you information all the time and the fast you drive the more the information just increases
i really do love the flexibility of this car it really does seem like it's on the edge
the chassis dynamics are good because of the low center of gravity because a player that engine is bad but determined f r s from really really good into rate it needs more power
i was wrong
it's good
but it isn't the <unk> s two thousand
there's c row body rover in this car i mean short of like the <unk> zero one we drove this is got the least body roll i've ever felt and of course the s two thousand francs a fifty fifty weight distribution and it weights as far as the f r s weights
this car's handling is unbelievably sharp and what i love is you can just roll on the floor and push harder harder
through the corner just like you do a motorcycle the heart you roll on the throttle the more settled the car
the f r s has a little bit better initial turn because the steering rack is tighter but the s two thousand seems to link the coroner or more consistently than f r s it get a little bit sly little bit of <unk> going on the s two thousand just clings hangs on
getting back in the f r s is like looking up your high school sweetheart on facebook
finding out that she is
almost as good as you remember her but here's the thing about the f r s this is version one point
designed this car is made specifically with the thinking mind that
people would be adding to it however i want this car to be just that much better it's so good why can't it be right
i really do love is car i step away for a while i think it really probably wasn't that good but come back and i realize you know what the f r s is <unk> but the <unk> it's gotten are completely deserted
this is a really impressive car it is a rewarding and fun to drive car but how rarely is that available in twenty five brand new
this has all the refinement and fine tuning the the f r s just hasn't got yet i expect that it will but the r x eight is about as great as this car going again and it feels very refined
i remember liking the first generation r x eight it was very willing and i love this car even more
now think about the arctic for me is that i'm very impressed i respect him i just can't fall in love with it
it's like meeting a friend of yours girlfriend and you recognize that she's hot but for whatever reason she doesn't do anything for you
i've got to listen to my heart i've got to listen to the car that made me cringe as soon as i got into the again you're looking for the most pure the clearest driving experience
for enthusiasts it's the <unk> s two thousand
now the <unk> to the s two thousand can put me in a dilemma on its cramped in here it's loud you got us in the engine running to the <unk> to give me power out of it these are all the same issues i have with the lotus elise
added twenty five to thirty grams of fiscal by the lotus by the fifteen to twenty <unk> this car makes all kinds of sense
what a day
and what an amazing three cars
i said it each of these <unk> them and thinking we're splitting hairs here
we are this is <unk> differences and i i'm honest when i say i came into the day with hope in mind truly i kind of thought i'd come and pick in the f r s and i didn't i love the f r s
it's a great car
it's fantastic but the car i jumped into and just started smiling i knew was the winner for me and that was the s two thousand
i wanted the f r s to live up to the hype would be the best out here and i have to say i love it it's a great car is still a four star it's little my top five all those things but the s two thousand is better
i can't believe a car that's ten years old is still so fantastic this is <unk> at the top of their game
yeah where has that car gone in <unk> lineup i not the car you know me i'm not a big fan <unk> that's the cars would make him buy a <unk> i like it's that it's an incredible car
well these two cars also answered the burning question does the f r s need more power
now i realize that should and these cars have forty more horsepower
and they have better weight distribution so they're a bit more predictable not that they are as bad though
i really like this car i should put another way i respected this car
okay
i can't fall in love with i don't know what it is about the other two just sparked me i fall in love with those two cars i've got to put the r x eight third but not because the bad car it's a great car just not caught for me i actually don't feel like that is as powerful as i wanted to be
with the f r s for the s two thousand just proves out <unk> hundred pounds with two hundred forty horse power the recipe starts to be exact and this one gets the closed but it just falls short if you drove them by themselves
fantastic car you'd have no awareness that it could be different or better
and of course our decisions could be wrong again
with these cars they will be wrong someone will hate yourself a someone will love us tell us in the comments we want to hear it from you
don't get me wrong it's great
but it isn't first place great not compared to these other two cars the f r s ties the s two thousand for best steering feel they're both good at different things
it's got my second favorite <unk> is not nearly as good as the one in the s two thousand
when i drive it i find that the most endearing it talks to me the most it <unk> up to me the best the car that i just want to get into in any condition and that's pretty remarkable
if you can find a r three you can find one for sale
buy this car the faster you go the more fun you have and it just it turns into a race car
i've genuinely impressed but i don't lust after the car i don't want one and i do the other two
frankly i didn't think this car would win for me but you realize this represents <unk> at the peak of their powers i don't understand why <unk> has gone completely off the rails
and gotten away from making brilliant driving machines likely the s two thousand
i will admit that i'm not really a <unk> guy went on a day like this on a road like this this car just make a lot of sense
so
how many bathrooms in the house
<unk> how many bathrooms
twelve
twelve
yeah
thirty-eight thousand square feet one helicopter helicopter comes with it
yep
got it
yes
so mark cuban has a three hundred and fifty million dollar boat
okay
he's gonna use it eight times all right and he lives in a thirty million dollar house
sure
so um getting four hour four hundred million on the boat lives in twenty-five million dollar house
sure
does it make sense right
right
you have a boat let's say is worth three fifty the first time you go into the mediterranean that boat is worth three hundred million
sure
after five years worth one fifteen and after ten years that both were fifty million dollars you buy a house in the platinum triangle anywhere right <unk> air beverly hills
and you look at any <unk> period of time and in the end of the day residential real estate
has <unk> to dow jones in the s p five hundred
sure
so like you get to limit your asset enjoy your asset like what's better than this right it comes with seven to the snap so we you know the <unk> i you know maybe international and you don't know your area you got a driver
right or
you have a chef you have a a <unk> you have a physical trainer you have everything the best of the best there's <unk> armed guard security here there's a booth that you can't see
crazy
this is black <unk> crystal losing the engine examination family for four generations
this the probably the most expensive valleys and ever see in your life it was two hundred and fifty thousand euros
crazy
and then we carved it out and put it on the diamond
so you're looking only got three hundred thousand
nice
um so bruce had an amazing quarry in greece and of hunting <unk> and then what he did was
he may have louis <unk> furniture out of it
basically yeah <unk> <unk> and bruce are the only two that own this
insane
take the most beautiful hunting <unk> on the planet and make it into louis <unk> <unk> <unk> the louis <unk> logo into the chest
yeah it's crazy
i mean there's
insane
a hundred and thirty-five art installations in this house
fifteen percent of are designed by bruce so you're gonna see stuff that you won't see anywhere in the world
right
um that bruce designed and created and this is one of those pieces
that's completely crazy
you're not allowed to come in here alright you stay there go look at other things
wow
i swim around <unk>
swim around <unk>
that's awesome there
yeah probably the
it says has a lot of things that i've never seen before in my entire life
and that's the idea behind it it says you know
yeah it worked
no one's ever seen that because it doesn't exist in any other house in the world
sure
broken back so of course
carved one out of um of honey <unk>
that's insane
yeah i get one of one something you won't see anywhere else in the world
that's insane
so this is a trip
i'm i'm like kind of speechless walking through this house
right for you to be speechless said wow
yeah
so you could be laying in bed right you could take your ipad your iphone you can order <unk> and <unk>
right
hey a <unk> it just has sixteen different chambers
wow
so it makes mixes most amazing <unk>
as in the bedroom in between their two closets and <unk> and then figure out what you are gonna wear
this your closet
ah this looks better
there are drawers in this house each one is aligned in
nuts
that gorgeous
yeah crazy
so the staircase alone took two years to build
and probably somewhere around two billion dollars
got twenty guys who again this isn't this isn't throne this is polished steel and to get polished feel to this level of finish is extremely difficult to do
what just happened
i mean this isn't this isn't a staircase this is art
yeah
take a look up here again the level of finish this thing is anchored at the bottom it's anchored at the top there's zero deflection again you're looking at a two million dollar staircase but i believe it's the center in this room
that's insane
oh i see something cool
yeah
we've got three hundred and fifty speakers in this house we've got three hundred inside we've got one hundred and fifty tickets outside but again we're sort of surrounded in this total privacy
insane
that's awesome
hey probably it will be looking like this eighty thousand dollar anchor
pick it that's jade right <unk> it's probably the most expensive <unk> in the world
that piece that you're looking at there's probably quarter million dollars and again like i said
inside their homes
outside
yep
crazy
dom <unk> <unk> into fire <unk> so we haven't fired this house we take whatever
you break the glass and put the house out with champagne
that's crazy
and again your client and to buying this house ryan will put whatever wines or spirits in he wants in there
sure
we want screaming eagle will follow places we've been do whatever it is
insane
trying to buy store pulled over when it to the store and said to the manager you know i'm gonna buy this camera and the guy said you know every camera in the sewers yourself but not this one and bruce would say everything's to sale
so after like a half hour of negotiation not only with the manager but the c e o of like a bruce had a <unk> waiting outside like in beverly hills
they had to take the <unk> off liked it because this was put in before they put this
wow
on the store right in here my <unk> and then took it by crane and run it through the <unk> and it landed right here on the main level
that's crazy
we didn't have a
it's a one on one it's probably worth somewhere around a million dollars
bonkers
you can actually see through it
right
behind this bar television we have a forty seat <unk> <unk> theater so you're watching the super bowl with forty of your closest friends or a premier when you're thirsty you come out here make a <unk>
hang out at the you know <unk> screen and then go back in this is what bruce calls it dignity luxury
so predicted to louis <unk>
<unk> mess right in the main vein
right yeah yes so predicted to earth voices
one more cool piece of art one of the fifty cars that doesn't hear
crazy
the <unk> on our body this is the world's fastest electric motorcycle in the world it's called
there's on five episode of sinful life by the face start
billionaire nine twenty-four <unk> air road
no
from zero to a hundred and twenty in less than three seconds
this is a <unk> <unk> theatre the absolute best residential and commercial application in the movie theater in the world
okay
ah we've got a crispy d cinema projector which today is the absolute best projector you could buy ah we've got <unk> speakers in here in sixteen <unk> each one of them is on its own channel that adhere the same night it came out of hollywood
just because you live in the area
no just because we're part of that this is <unk> air circuit it's like a club yeah
oh crazy
it's like joining an expensive country club at the end of day
but you get the movies the night they hit the theater
right so if you're having forty of your closest friends to watch a movie that's coming out that night sweat easier than million downtown
that's crazy
yeah so we put together a <unk> demo for you sit back relax enjoy it
oh
right now you're listening towards cinematic audio has been
that was insane
it looks something like this it does the pinnacle of the house that just it has everything
that's it nine twenty-four
truly the eighth wonder of the world shawn elliott thank you so much
you are welcome barry
on the market for a hundred and <unk> million dollars
thank you
craziest thing okay i i actually i feel sad leaving right now
yeah cuz this is unlike anything i've ever seen in my entire life
it's like getting off
that's exactly what you said that feeling when you get off the boat you're like oh i have to go back to my regular life that's how i feel right now leaving this house for regular life it's sad
yeah i feel bad for you but you know what you don't want come back any time
all right thanks man
thank you i appreciate it thank you brother
all right we're out thank you
some times i really feel that the world around us continues to be more hectic and more complicated and so many of us are truly craving to find simplicity
and here in queensland australia that is exactly what a young couple discovered when they made the decision to build a tiny house on wheels
hey amy how are you
hi how are you
good lovely to meet you get it greg how's it going
and nice to meet you bros
it's nice to <unk> you and super cool to see this beautiful home
thank you we're really glad to have you here
so how did you come to be living in a tiny house
ah well we actually found out about moving through on your videos so um i was binge watching the videos and i send one altar to greg and then said hey why don't we build a tiny house and to my surprise he agreed and
took that and ran with him before he could change his mind so you know in a few month so ah we had a tiny house of our own
and you really have found a fantastic parking spot for the home as well
yeah we're really lucky because ah one our friend has been kind enough to just let us park up here on our property and one other guy products essentially so yes it's really nice we get a nice view it's very quiet get away from a lot of street noise and just
peaceful
yeah it gives us a bit of land as well to have a <unk> patch and everything like that so and we have that nice community spirit with her can have on a family dinner before night and yeah i couldn't want more i guess
and what was that made you really fall in love with the idea of living in a tiny house
i think for us it's probably the simplicity of the lifestyle i think also the financial freedom so that's probably the biggest pot for us we'd ought to be tied down to a job and then he now we can live a lifestyle we truly love
yeah definitely yeah
and tell me a little bit about the aesthetic of this home it's beautifully crafted
well honestly mercer was may we did mainly from everything from the outside is mainly based from around the joint window we decided that any room that we were going to have inside we will make sure we could
really spend a lot of time outside enjoying it so
yeah i think i want something i can sink into the background so nothing that stand out so much and i like to think the state of the natural look at that and i think whilst they can still sink into the background and doesn't stand out too much it's really quite striking and modern
and we really did spend a little time we wherein in a bigger house we spend a lot more time in outdoor areas was so on we kept the same outdoor area and just made made a bit more space essentially when we had there
that's it so all of the <unk> as much a last greg spent hours <unk> away with hollywood and everything so i could keep the the costs down and ah minimize the footprint on on everything is well so
john that said if we have to move we can't put all upon it would be a difficult task when a simple but it can be done and we can take it to our next parking spot
really good sized water tank here is well
yes so i think what it was okay we managed to make it through the drought period that we will here only just before he got all that <unk> which was great but having the two kids in the house we really need a large tank so we have gone with a ten thousand <unk> tank there
<unk> so it wasn't plastic which is important for the quality of water for us and it ties in really nicely with the design of the house so that was a bonus
i know most of the time you live here by yourselves but greg sometimes you have your kids over as well don't you
yes every second week for five days we have them um my son who is turning thirteen this year and my daughter who is ten we thought they'd have a bit of trouble adapting to it but it was honestly very smooth when we introduced them to the house they get excited and then
it was like yeah we have somewhere to sleep now let's go play outside
and so what size is the tiny house
ah so this one is seven point two meters long that's two point four wide and about four point two high so we try to keep it all up with the legal aspects to be able to happen on the road
well the house is just beautiful from the outside i really love this wonderful entertaining dig that you've built onto it and i cannot wait to see what you've got going on inside shall we check it out
yes let's do
all right thank you
oh this is gorgeous
thank you we all very proud of it
it's especially beautiful just walking in and immediately being greeted by this very comfortable looking lounge
yeah aim comfort was the main goal with this so we found that in a regular sized house we spent a lot of time in the lounge room on the couch watching movies playing games with the kids so we need an account that could accommodate all four of us
and be comfortable so we designed the layout actually of the lounge room based off the size of this account so other <unk> does double as storage which is always important in your tiny house
the bed obviously pulled out from under there as well which is great to have that extra sleeping space if you need it
we actually find that we'd spread that out more often than not to have more family time really we spend more time with it i'll just hanging out like that rather than just in this l shaped couch
formal seating so well actually lays out what is the movie playing games
yeah so
sounds good to me and lots of windows here giving you really nice views into the outdoors
yeah we really want to capitalize on the view and bring in as much natural light as possible for a tiny house i think it's a bit small i can feel even smaller if it doesn't have that natural light and that just makes a few area brightened does it make you feel so <unk> i think
and then we also get a beautiful cross phase which is essential in the hot weather here is so that helps as well keeps the place cool
yeah it certainly is essential because the weather here you really do get some extremes don't you
so i think in the last few months had floods and <unk> so you know this is been a great way to be able to still keep cool and keep that electricity bill down so
and then you've got a really good sized kitchen here
yeah so we do a lot of meal prepping so we thought we would like a big bench i think that was key for us because we do the meal prepping together so we need to be able to work together in the space at one time and them also doubles as a great space to be able to work and have our food as well
study space so originally we made sure this bench space that is at the end here was mainly just so that we could do work or study there as well so we've got space to do it
yeah and we also want to have a lot of overhead cupboard space there as well for storage and to keep it nice and tidy rather than an open <unk> just because it's quite dusty out here in the bush area
and it's so lovely how this window here can just completely open the kitchen up to the outdoors
yeah so we actually designed a lot of the house around the <unk> window there and when it opens up it really does brings the outside in we use it a lot with
if we have friends over we meal prep here and just hand the meals over there and we can all still talk and and communicate together and this sort of starts to feel more like an island bench in the kitchen rather than a wall separating you guys and it's really cool
and then really good size appliances here in the kitchen full size fridge and lots of storage that's been built into the stairs there too
yes so um this was a little bit to get it to work the um fridge was from our previous um state house and we want to keep that just because we like the design of the fringe space being over the top we've popped our microwave in here which is
keeping it nice and well hidden also has extra stories we're talking boards and bread which is really great to keep the cat and it's nice and clear up here the rest of the story shower is actually for our clothing and then behind these baskets we've got quite a deep space here
so we can hide extra items like ah ah <unk> in there as well as the clothing on the spot up there all the dog stuff as well keep it all neat and tidy and keeps up benches clear which is really good
yeah and because we like to food prep so much not <unk> in the oven was essential for us as well so we need to make sure that we kept that up on the right size we <unk> to the two burner stove but that wasn't an issue really because
yeah we do things out of a slow cooker or the oven the rest of the time so it wasn't really a problem
and the other stories that we really love it here is actually a pull out pantry so um a lot of work went into that and we actually measured out how think we need it to be to fit jobs and everything so make most of that space as well
then we've got the <unk> above us here
yes so that was actually in addition that we added to the standard design with this one we need to have a space for the children as well so that's really great because um they can have their own space and be apart from us but they are still part of the family unit
um we chose not to <unk> it just so i could have that open field and also to limit it getting to hot up there with the cross braces as well
and then through there we have your bathroom and it's really nice how you created this full length of a window
yes ah the window we wanted to create a space i guess where from one end of the house to the other it was really open ended so when you're sitting in the lounge room and looking through
um you just see straight out into nature and it doesn't just cut the household and feel like it suddenly ends
great size shall we have gotten here
yeah so it's um not quite the same as the nine hundred i think eight twenty by eight twenty so a little bit smaller than normal but we have a beautiful waterfall shower head which makes it really look serious to have a shower in there
um we also have the addition of another labor window there just to try to bring the inside out again and also to extract some of that steam which can cause a bit of trouble in a tiny space as well so feels very lovely having a shower and they're actually probably better than our own house
it's one of the best shows we've ever had in that thing so yeah it's amazing
and then it's great to see you've got the <unk> toilet here
yes so that was probably our favorite thing about the house moving into it yeah where's the toilet when we ask that question um i think it's just that so unique in design and being in a drought area i guess it's so great with the water usage
yeah we think that was one of the things that helped us get through a part of that drought period before we started to get all the floods was the fact that we did not have a flushing toilet be like we were getting very close at the end of our tank and we thankfully got the rain but yeah the the <unk> toilet like it doesn't use
water to get rid of it it's so much easier
and great to see you've got the washing machine there as well
that's it from my old house as well which worked out really well and have to buy new appliances no need for a dryer in in this climate so we just hang up on the outside on the deck or in the sun so
we do make sure that we use um a lot of the eco friendly <unk> liquid and laundry <unk> is the same as well so that when it runs off to wear grey water because we use that out and now crosses and gardens and things like that we will help
yeah we're not putting anything toxic out into the environment as well
of course
like recycled water we can here
yeah and then really nice size menacing in here as well
yes so um i think every girl wants a nice big fantasy so this was kind of my brain child i wanted the pendant lights and the <unk> for my beauty products um a big nice thing to be able to wash my face and do my makeup
and i think it just it works really well as well with the kids um generally getting the kids ready for school there's two of them in the bathroom it's nice and big they can both still brush their teeth through their hair do it then at the same time when i was fighting and yeah well that's good
obviously we've got you sleeping well
yes our little sanctuary
this is just so cozy up here and having that <unk> is just lovely isn't it
yeah this this <unk> is it's it's our sanctuary and this <unk> really just makes it what it is it brings in all that light
yeah i think even compared to um ah bedrooms at the previous homes this is probably the most comfortable and luxurious that we've had we invested in a good mattress that was a little bit thinner so i could gain a little bit of extra room
and yeah it's been a lovely experience being out here
i think that a lot of people see sleeping <unk> and they immediately kind of freak out and say i could never do that but there really is something which is just so cozy and comfortable about climbing into a <unk> and you feel so protected in a space like this don't you
so it's like an astronaut and safe i think if we had been closed maybe the front portion of it might feel a little bit more <unk> but it's so airy and bright and i think you know we don't feel confined or anything like that it's very open
the view that we have is quite nice as well and we get the views out to the sides and at night we get the the night sky it's it's amazing up here it's not anything to really be worried about it's one of those things that we look forward to
yeah and i think ah a lot of people are nervous about the transition to a <unk> style and it's probably not ideal for people with mobility issues but the stairs are easy to navigate we haven't had any issues got <unk> there and everything to help so
yeah it's been an easy transition
and so how long have you been living in this tiny house now
i think we're going on just on six months now all full time living in a tiny house so it's gone really fast actually
we didn't weak actually believe we went like four months without a t v
yeah i mean time goes so fast again and i think in another sense it also doesn't feel like it's only been six months and you know it wasn't easy change of lifestyle change of pace and and it's just been such an easy transition into it that i think it feels like
it's something we've been doing for years and i think we spent such a long time in the design phase and the builders worked so closely with us i don't think there's anything that's gone into this that isn't a well thought out process
yeah a lot of people ask us you know are you over the tiny house yet and and it's
in love with the design everyday so and and the lifestyle offers
absolutely
and can we talk a little bit about price what did this cost to build
so all up we spent about a hundred thousand so that included the build finishing the water tank delivery so significantly less than a mortgage
everything we pay for daily or through monthly now as well has significantly dropped like electricity prices like we're not off grid yet but we do plan on this being a solar powered house eventually as well
with water like we said we've got a ten thousand <unk> tank and that gets us by fine it's just been a very comfortable transition with money wise as well like expenditures going out is another thing that made it very comfortable
yeah absolutely
and so what does the future hold for you both now
honestly hopefully a lot more travel and exploring and living life and enjoying it so hopefully the freedom that comes with this tiny will allow us to um become financially free as well
and um have a five year plan hopefully buy a big block of our own and yeah just see where it takes us i guess
yeah we're excited to be able to um hopefully take this over to a bigger block in yeah i don't think we could ever do a a normal sized house ever again though we have tiny is something we will stick with ah yeah we'll definitely be doing a lot more living again now cause
we can yes it's really opened up a lot of freedom in our lives and it seems weird to say that i moved into a smaller house so now i'm more free but like once you do it you really get it you know it's
when it comes about the lifestyle opposed to doing that daily grind to pay for a house that you don't get to enjoy
which we thoroughly do enjoy
yes absolutely i think living in this home it's taught us something that we maybe didn't expect i guess i'll transition to a tiny living was
born from a more tragic time in our life you know the passing of of my father and everything that caused us to to question how we were living life and what direction we were going you know we didn't want to
sit back in a fifty years time and realize that we had a waste of time with our family and loved ones and you know gone through the daily grind and had enjoyed life so it's really it's been an opening experience
it generally comes down to time like the experience of being in this house it comes down to how much time we have now we have time together we have time to just be in
a sense where we're not worried about the the hustle and bustle of daily life where where we relax together we're able to problem solved together where we just be together and i think
make the most of every day
yeah
not promised tomorrow so you gotta look for the now
you really have just built such a beautiful home for yourself and it's wonderful to see that whether you've also built some wonderful options for your future thank you so much for sharing your home with me
thank you for coming out for us
it's my pleasure amy and greg truly have built themselves such a beautiful home here but more than just a home they've built an entire lifestyle around it
one that offers them more financial freedom more connection with nature greater connection with one another and things that are truly <unk> important to them in life and really that is such a beautiful thing
let's go
today we are going to do something new we are at western avenue in <unk> and we are going to talk about philips new project from colossal properties
so what i thought this thing is going to touch this three sixty character and then effectively that means that i'm not holding it and walking through the property you can basically just control it as it of some one looking at the v r or looking at them in facebook
this is it there walking through the house we're gonna see as it a test
okay philips these look pretty incredible
yeah it's also about two weeks out
two weeks out i can bet you all of that cause it is looking like them a lot further on
yeah this one is in the <unk> phase
i mean someone's gonna walk in here and effectively kind of get taking it all by
work looks like you got something hiding up there which will lost your back yeah but let's go to
this is a two year project
so broke around two years ago
yeah
that's very different in this
yeah <unk> would be much much quicker
six months are the fast generally i turn them around two or three maybe four month if you are on it every single day it goes quick but these things because of the scale they just take time
so let's go explore it let's have a look and ah and so it was in such really in depth impression about
definitely i'm gonna tell you to see this they look and tell me and how much they stole away
this is a six hundred pound door
in order to get
that's not the way of a
it's not a couple screws holding it in place people it takes a lot of work to get it to play
floating stair case cable rails
knew that's really awesome because if you are like that area onto the stairs is always such under utilize like area it's actually kind of creative
yeah we will show piece
like frame these staircase is coming up
so here will have the glass and will be able to
and it looks like temperature control
temperature control of course
and the <unk> lighting is gonna be the only lighting in there
l e d straight plate
that's what i thought
figured it out
figured it out
so that's come through here i mean one thing i have to say which i think you are incredibly good at this
i'm not allowed to use this thing
very clean load
same thing with the fridge the panel
are you finding that it's a general thing that people need to move one fridge
i think you need it yeah i think you need it you gotta store all your you know fresh coconut juices
and you have beautiful <unk> throughout view even it went all the way into the window <unk>
yeah we took it inside window <unk> here just finished it off nicely
perfect
yeah exactly
so can we declared you <unk> have three things
they better like eating food
but
yeah we're gonna put in the action because all glass on this side we put in the ceiling so
since we didn't have a real t v wall
and so we'll have the <unk> inch t v there mounted
sitting there enjoying nature in the creek and you get a little bit like oh you know what is game on
yeah
you got so sick in the same scene put your button and the t v appears in front of you
alright let's go and see this ah balcony looking down to the creek right here
so fire pit we know that you are a big fan of fire pits and they are every single of your properties i remember
this was an ethanol fire pit yes this is ethanol
fire pit we do have a gas one on the lower level but this one is ethanol
so is that becoming a bigger trend you think
couple different of varieties of fire features in the house
okay cool and then looking at these i'm in love with these railings right here i feel like when we're going see luxury development properties right now it's glass glass glass
yes
and like you've told me
yeah and they don't look the greatest once house start aging right versus these i feel like have much longer life spend looking good while they are serving a purpose
yeah
so what was the reason you ended up going for this direction
well actually this was the architects ah selection
okay
the architect david hertz he's ah based at venice
which we we know his name but if you guys out there do not know david hertz go and look up <unk> what is it technically called the house
i think the airplane
airplane house
yeah this seven forty seven <unk> jet wings used as a roof
that yeah and so yeah look that up guys because it's the same guy that designed that that has brought his design field
and he likes to in integrate some industrial elements into modern designs that's why you see like the steel railing on the cable rail likes to bring in some of the industrial
and since we're up here can we talk about this beautiful <unk> you have on
oh yeah absolutely
which you can actually see you guys like half way through
putting on a <unk> ah oil based <unk> so this is cedar wood and it's been ah tongue and groove <unk> again that's a selection from david hertz
yeah
ah who likes to use no only some industrial elements like <unk> but natural elements that you know <unk> and organic
but these these
this is an area i'll always
who got some look corridor leading who will spend time here why got to matter about light
right
it makes so much
up on these floor top of the property what we got up there
so up here we have four bedrooms and then plus an office
so you are not saying office is a bedroom like a lock in
extra extra
i like that
three guest bedrooms
good guest bedrooms so this is better we know
hey this is the worth
this is the <unk>
it's spend i mean it's weird than my grand bedroom
or my own bedroom in my apartment
yes
i'm this not normal i'm actually again architecture you go one two three four different aspects
different eye windows there store is
and so is this help playing again with what
so this staff core you see all the cook roof designs start feeling that in this phase
okay
okay so here we are in the master
we are in the master
and again your thing with stone is gone to another level with this architect where actually you put ah increasingly piece of stone work
but it was a matching the light and the scene in there
absolutely this is white marble and we ah set it up here in the fire place matching the ceiling design
and double pocket doors on the exterior which is really difficult to do because the exterior doors have be <unk> and get them to sit right inside the door
and also did blackout shades
for all these windows in this room which again was a challenge because look at these the design of the windows and then up here clear story and there actually a pockets
they were verse roll up in order block out the light coming in
and philip tell us about this book magic i mean the stone looks beautiful here but i know it wasn't easy
this labs individual the book matching with this main coming here and white marble are extreme heavy
so and yeah it kind of get this sort of organic feel it's pretty cool
and then all the windows basically leads to this beautiful balcony you have the same style of railing and you have this it makes all i see is green tree
i know
that's insane
yeah
so so nice it feels like you are not in the city
you really get a good respected of the ah lamp if you come up here as well
this you always hide the architect to create light streams took these plant
so yeah this is like an exterior <unk> out here
it is so cool and this is the architect style that light
architect yeah so this way you get a balcony over handing but you also get some additional sunlight coming in
and just such a beautiful details that ties everything together
so i just walked in the natures bathroom and i'll be i've just seen details everywhere and i've seen this cut them beautiful
so bill tell us what it takes in get a piece like this in here
right so we call this a integrated sink which means we take stone in this case a sea stone of course and we build the sink out of the actually stone
works for scenes and you also have the sinks build with the same material right
here that's building with the same thing a carbon tree underneath the drawers
it's look so simple of here but getting all these details right get in all corners edges everything level it's tremendous in hour
and there were a big mirror next to wall after we solve that
yeah let's talk about this shower let's talk about this
we put the body's <unk> in
very nice
yes exactly and then there rain shower it
ah
i mean the draining is down there
back if the colors of grey
exactly just look theme less you're eyes are not going to fit to the drain you just want you just wanna it look really natural that's the goal of it
and i mean i don't know if that shower get it bring enough to it
so we just walked into the first floor space and i mean i've see this countered tub i've got to ask what is that for
almost looks likes an
we have a
e panels there built into you can up light it change the colors more of less the
so you have any optional color
oh yeah this small the entertaining space you come down here where you have the bar you have the smoke mirror l e d led shells for the link to the wine fridge fridge sink dish <unk>
see through the counter tub it opening up to the family room and open to the back yard and then i want to show you guys this cool two person movie theater
i mean you can already tell the sound difference in here
yeah
yeah
hey thomas so you better talk about the <unk> that you use for the walls
so this is acoustic penalty and then we put a wall covering on it we also did this speakers so those speakers down
you actually get close to it you can see these <unk> but eventually blends into the look
yeah and we did some walls guns is surround sound <unk> like a <unk> for there again
where you know the <unk> and then a curved projector screen
we just step outside and now let's talk about this back yard
yeah
seriously
the entertainers dream forty foot long pool hot tub twelve foot long fire pit out door kitchen with a beer tab
real try us
so these towels are awesome
oh yes these <unk> very expensive it's like
they highlight at night
yeah and i get a little shimmer to them
if you don't mind me asking how much you paying for a score philip do you remember
that was like thirty five dollar a foot
two people two people out there you can get it tiles like your pool for likes three bucks a foot that's ten times more
since we're in the pool let's talk about the finish that you gonna do cause i see tile but i see the remaining of the pool
still unfinished what do you have in mind
exactly yes so we have the tile and then we will put it and do it finish with plaster
table tag which kind of have some tables it will a dark plaster so it's kind of like the ocean
beautiful i mean it's gonna look so great
and the architect just design the pool to have
so we see he has a stair case
pool and
this ways this stays all clear there're swim lake you will couple laps
yeah
did a pretty good job taking these
then infinity edge with a water over
yeah water i'm assuming all up flowing from this into the pool
yeah so then there's a water fall out in that side too you'll see of the back side
okay
so now we're at the point we gonna check the back yard but i want my boy <unk> to come with me so what you say
well my leg is not working so i know what you want me to do
well i got you back
you want to carry me down this
okay you sure about this
oh my god
we're ready just keep your thought in place i got you
this is where the law suit stops the house
and we have the owner here that's perfect
okay that was pretty sweet
at least we know the stairs are built the way you could carry some
because you keep carrying someone
and i think i'm gonna charge him for his gym member
give him a good workout um okay so we're just going down here to the backyard literally when we see these luxury properties it's almost like oh yeah i've got twenty thousand square foot lot but ninety percent of all things like that
right
which the problem is that you can't be use it this you actually come down here thinking there's nothing down
basically you got you got your own area put your foot out here
and it's natural
this is natural
it was like this when you have it
it was like this so we just ah a little more grown in but we kind of clear up getting ready to put some grass in
we are restored the creek bed because when it rains this actually is a natural flood channel that goes all the way down to sand and we send in then the ocean
we restore the creek bed and put a little bridge
and we're gonna put some lighting in the trees and make this little like magical garden area or the meadow as we call it

real estate investing rules of thumb the two percent rule the fifty percent rule and the seventy percent rule
there are some rules of thumb that can help investors quickly scream through deals to make a good educated guess on whether not to pursue them
now this is important notice that i didn't say there are some rules of thumb that help investors make purchase decisions
because rules of thumb are not meant to be hard and fast rules they simply help an investor get a quick and dirty opinion on some valuable metrics
always do a proper analysis but regardless these rules of thumb can come in really handy in saving you from analyzing every single deal that you've come across
my name is <unk> turner and in this video i've outlined several of the most common real estate map rules of thumb
so you can begin practicing them in your own analysis of properties
first the two percent rule also known as the one percent rule or the two percent test
perhaps one of the most common rules of thumb used by rental property investors is known as the two percent rule
but not because it's a rule so i say two percent test i like that better
essentially this rule of thumb looks at the monthly rent divided by the value of the property in a percentage form
for those who just got confused let's make this super simple if a property rents for two thousand dollars a month
and the value is two hundred thousand dollars and in two thousand divided by two hundred thousand equals one percent
in this example the property does not pass the two percent test but it doesn't meet the one percent test exactly
or what if the property it rents for fifteen hundred hundred a month and it costs a hundred and eighty thousand to buy well fifteen hundred divided by a hundred eight thousand is point eight percent
that's definitely short of the one percent rule or one percent test now what if that property rents for fifteen hundred a month but it's worth a hundred and twenty thousand
well fifteen hundred divided by a hundred twenty thousand equals one point two five percent all right so you get how that works now right but what does it mean
well essentially the one percent or two percent test gives us a quick and dirty view on whether or not the property will produce positive cash flow
and of course just a rule of thumb it isn't always precise but generally speaking the higher the percentage the better the cash flow
this is also greatly depends on location price and how much the expenses truly are on the property
but the rule of thumb can help an investor make some decisions on whether or not to pursue a certain property
for example i know that most properties that fall short of one percent will likely never produce a positive cash flow for me
if it's one and two percent it probably will and if it's above two percent which is really hard to find today then i'm almost positive that it will
so if my real estate agent tells me that they have a perfect rental house for me to buy and i see that the purchase price is a hundred and twenty-five thousand
and i find that old rent for a thousand dollars a month i can make a very quick decision and i know that most likely ideal ain't gonna ever provide cash flow
because it falls short of the one percent rule because a thousand divided by a hundred twenty-five equals point eight percent
in a case like this i probably wouldn't spend any more time looking at the deal if i was only interested in the cash flow
so that's the value of the two percent rule test thing while the two percent rule and the one percent rule or test we just mentioned
they can help you get with a like go no go decision on looking further into a rental property
it doesn't really tell us how much cash flow we might expect for that investors often rely on the fifty percent rule of thumb
the fifty percent rule states that on average and over time half of the income in a property is spent on operating expenses
now what our operating expenses well good question operating expenses are all of the expenses involved with running a rental property
except the loan payment so it includes taxes insurance utilities repairs vacancy and other metrics
that leave the <unk> checking account every single month or every year depends on how you want to look at it
the fifty percent rule can help an investor quickly estimate the cash flow of a rental property because it combines all of those expenses except for the loan into one easy number
so let's work through this imagine a property rents for two thousand dollars a month the fifty percent says half of this a thousand will be spent on expenses
this means we're left with a thousand bucks but now we need to make the mortgage payment on this right unless you paid cash for the property but let's say you didn't
so with that thousand dollars we have left let's say the mortgage is six hundred dollars so how much do you have left four hundred bucks
because two thousand times fifty percent equals a thousand a thousand minus six hundred for operating expenses is four hundred dollars in cash flow
that remaining number is what you can estimate over time on average you might get in monthly cash flow
of course that fifty percent estimate on operating expenses can really vary wildly depending on the property
in some areas taxes and insurance might be incredibly high but in other areas that might be much lower some properties require that the landlord pay all the utilities
where other properties allow the tenant to pay their own and while inherent weaknesses do exist
the fifty percent rule does have value i mean when you are looking at a property that rents for twelve hundred bucks a month
and you know the mortgage payment would be around a thousand you can pretty much guarantee that property will not produce a positive cash flow
because two hundred bucks a month is not a lot of room for all those expenses because twelve hundred times fifty percent equals six hundred
six hundred minus a thousand is negative four hundred right now the fifty percent rule helps keep real estate investors in check
and to remind us that there are a lot of expenses that over time add up yeah i mean a new roof is only needed every twenty years
but if you divide a ten thousand dollars roof into two hundred forty months that roof is actually costing you <unk> bucks a month every single month
these operating expenses add up over time and as most investors have seen they tend to settle around fifty percent giving a long enough time frame
okay on to the final rule of thumb today the seventy percent rule
the last couple of rules of thumb that we talked about we're designed to help rental property owners but what about the house <unk> the <unk> i don't want to leave you guys out
so for those who are flipping houses the seventy percent rule can be helpful in determining just how much to pay for a property
the seventy percent rule states that the most you should pay for a potential flip is seventy percent of the after repair value like what it would sell for when it was all fixed up
minus the repair cost so example if a hole would sell for three hundred grand all fixed up and the property needed fifty grand worth of work to get there
then three hundred thousand times seventy percent is two hundred ten thousand subtract out that fifty thousand dollar and you're left with one hundred sixty k
according to the seventy percent rule the most someone should pay for that property would be a hundred sixty k but of course there are problems with the seventy percent rule
this rule of thumb assumes that thirty percent of the a r v the after repair value is going to be spent on holding costs on closing costs on the buying side the selling side
commissions taxes attorney fees title company fees and more and the <unk> profit and any other charges that come up during the deal now this works well in some markets
but it has some severe limitations
for example the seventy percent rule doesn't really work that well for a property with a really low a r v after a pair of values
such as fifty thousand dollars as mentioned earlier the thirty percent <unk> from the a r v includes the holding cost and the closing cost as well as a profit
the investor or the <unk> wants to make however like thirty percent of fifty grand is like fifteen thousand dollar so following the seventy percent rule
all of the fees cost and profit would only be fifteen grand
if the fees and holding costs were to total like ten grand that would leave just five thousand dollar in profit for the house <unk>
and i don't know any house <unk> who's gonna take on the risk of flipping a house for just five grand
so following the seventy percent rule a <unk> or <unk> would pay far too much for the property in this example
an investor flipping houses at this level might require far less than seventy percent maybe a fifty percent or even lower
now a similar problem exists with the seventy percent rule for more expensive properties
the seventy percent rule would dictate that a home with an a r v of seven hundred grand that needs fifty grand at work
should produce a maximum offer of four hundred and forty thousand
but in most markets finding a seven hundred dollar property for four hundred and forty thousand is simply not feasible
a person who sticks exclusively to that seventy percent rule are likely never gonna find a good enough deal to ever flip in a single property in that market
in this case eight percent or even <unk> percent might be good enough
furthermore some investors may spend more or less on fees and costs because of their particular life situation or location
for example in some states purchasing a home may require three grand in closing costs while in other states it might be six thousand dollars
some investors may have a real estate license which saves them tens of thousands of dollars in commissions
whereas other investors well they may need to pay commissions when they actually sell the property so how should the seventy percent rule be valued
well carefully it's a quick and dirty way to <unk> the approximate amount you should pay for a property
but as with all rules of thumb no concrete decisions should be made unless you've run a real estate analysis on the property
and of course if you want to do that check out the bigger pockets a suite of <unk> you can get them at <unk> dot com forward slash <unk> c a l c

well you have been known as the greatest generation

second world war brought about a sense of patriotism in this country that we have not seen since

terry crawford
good morning sir i'm so happy you're concerned about how i'm doing
hey
i could just see it all now depending on how much money you have in your pocket
nothing
nothing you came to court today knowing you have a fine and you didn't take any money with you
no sir
oh you didn't go to the bank and take money out of your bank account
no bank account
you don't oh
i put all my money up under up under the bed
who do you live with
my girl
oh did she give you some money this morning
nah she wants money she takes money from me
does she work
i pay her
oh you're supporting her oh i see well coming from your residence
there was loud music
yes sir i've been there fifteen years
hold on for a minute police could hear the music from outside and they issued ah issued you a two hundred dollar fine
so what do you want to tell me about this
well i've been there fifteen years no problem we got new neighbors that moved in and they called the cops on me they could've knocked on the door i would've turned the music down
was it a radio or what was it
oh it was a radio
radio
you have the <unk>
yeah yes sir
you have <unk>
yeah
what time of day was it
ah i think it was about eleven o'clock
at night
yes sir
yeah
mister crawford i have a summons before me
that indicates that on april <unk> that
there was hard music coming from your residence
it does not state
the time
so the summons is incomplete
ah my philosophy is that everyone should be entitled
to the full benefit of the law whether or not they're an experience attorney or not so if you came here with an attorney today an attorney would make a motion to dismiss
because the summons is incomplete now you don't know that because you're not a lawyer but there's no reason why you shouldn't have the benefit of having to law enforced on your behalf
but i know that and it will be immoral if i fine you when a summons is incomplete so i'm gonna dismiss it
thank you your honor
with the promise from you that keep the music down right
okay
what were you doing were you dancing with your girlfriend what was going on
yeah i had a little disco ball in my house and you know
i just turned the music up i mean i didn't realize
let me see your best move let me see your best move
give him the great street slide
there you go
thank you your honor
good morning
um caroline you've been here so long it's afternoon
excuse me i got up at five a m and drove through three hours of boston traffic because i believe in my innocence and i plead in um not guilty
by pleading not guilty what you're saying is you want to come back and have a trial
no okay then i don't plead not guilty can you look at my summons
yeah look at her summons
basically what i believe i explained ah is faulty
caroline i don't hear a word you're saying unless you speak
based on what i believe i heard you say earlier it's a faulty summons
really
well maybe i didn't understand
explain that to me
because the because
um
um
the speed i was supposed to be driving at is not posted
oh you want that
that's what i thought i heard
you were listening
i was listening
so every single word i said and you said i wonder if any of this applies to me
um no i still believe in my innocence before that
well tell me about it
um well i came back and went to the school and recreated the scene and took film at night
and i used to be a school teacher and ah it's very very hard to see the speed limit um at that location ah there's there's no speed limit in front of the school so
that's why i'm here because i believe that there should be more signs
well the first thing you don't want to do is start lecturing the judge
i'm sorry
and what should be done because some judges get very upset
no it's not your job to do that anyway
oh good okay it's not my job
no
be careful he's a tough guy
okay
he's on the <unk> team
first guys out there with the big guns
no just concerned about the kids
oh i see
let me explain to you what's going on to everybody else
they they just began this system and the first wave of some of this that went out there were a whole bunch of them
that did not indicate the speed limit in the small blocks where the print is big
and they indicated the speed limit up at the top of the summons you can't see it you need you literally need a magnifying glass to see it
so i have taken the position that the summons was inadequate for the city to prevail there's such a disparity between the power of the individual and the power of the sovereign that they should get it right the first time
i think that
thank you
unless it's a crime of moral <unk> then i think there are other factors involved but these these are speeding tickets
i'm not <unk> speeding but i think everybody should be afforded all their be afforded all their constitutional rights
thank you
even though
even though you come from massachusetts
no but i grew up in rhode island
where
i grew up in johnston i went to saint mary's academy of the visitation in providence and my father is here in a nursing home and that's why i was here
oh okay
i'm a rhode islander
okay
i don't know if that matters
could the it doesn't matter it's not gonna help you with
i know
but based on the summons the summons was incomplete
okay
so the <unk> gonna be dismissed
thank you so much
good luck
i won't do it again
everybody says that
no i won't
then they come back the following week

she's in school right now
you only have one child
yeah
okay
and
and the other one from the other plate i had registered a car
well wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute i'm try still trying to determine
why you would go through
the seven <unk> one by the hospital
one
i'm trying to why would you go through nine red lights okay
i mean were you being pursued by somebody or were you just
yeah
judge danny checked on that he said there was a couple of reports of something that there was some damage to her vehicle and stuff like that but he goes he doesn't think all of them
and as far as the other plate i have no idea there's another plate from some stuff in two thousand eleven
all right <unk> i am
we are very sensitive to matters involving personal safety particularly people who are being stalked for like whatever reason and that's very personal with you
and so we're not gonna get into that at all but we understand that inspector quinn just had a conversation with me relative to that
okay
many of these were not related to anything else except that you went through you violated the traffic violation the traffic
okay
right
and some maybe because of a state of mind that you had could have had some affect on your driving but certainly not all of these okay and there are several of them
so i'm gonna now inquire into your ability to pay these fines okay
so are you working
yes
what do you do
i'm a <unk> for a staffing agency
okay and you have one child
um <unk> i'm a single parent
i can understand you're going through some difficulty and that's why we're gonna try to help you out okay
there are in this country and this world some very generous people and some very compassionate and understanding people
and i receive correspondence from all over the world every week and many of the correspondents <unk> checks from people who wanna help other people because they have become familiar with the court proceedings here
so
i have a correspondence from a
individual by the name of <unk> <unk> from <unk> pennsylvania and he sent me a check for a hundred dollars
asking that i use this
exercising my discretion
but that i do it by exercising some compassion and empathy okay
so i'm gonna use that a hundred dollars to help pay your fine your fine is gonna to be a total
of three hundred fifty dollars additionally
i'm going to employ the
generosity of a second
and that is the <unk> family of phoenix arizona they sent me a check for seventy-five dollars
these people are both immigrants and they wanna help someone else who is in need
so we're gonna use that seventy-five dollars check for you as well so that's a hundred seventy-five
i have a check from
casa mesa california from a <unk> muller coaching
asked me to use my discretion to help someone who is in need and sent in a check for fifty dollars so i'm gonna use those three checks and that comes to two hundred and twenty-five dollars
so you're gonna owe one hundred twenty-five dollars okay
can i give you a hug

twenty twenty has been a year but thankfully it was a pretty great year for video games i g n scored more games as masterpieces than any other year for more than two decades
though of course it wasn't all tens and gold stars we also rated more games in one year at a three or lower that's awful or worse than we have in a while
so without further ado here are i g <unk> best and worst reviewed games of twenty twenty
crusader kings three is a superb strategy game a great r p g and a master class on how to take the best parts of an existing system and make them deeper and better
i have thousands of hours in the previous game and i expect to spend at least that many in this third installment
all of the <unk> flawed characters and stories of love war triumph and loss that have already dynamically emerged from my <unk> feel like just the beginning of something legendary
in fact if i had to pick only one game to play for the rest of my life the decision wouldn't be that difficult
a new king of historical strategy has been crowned long live the king
back when v r first became a real thing and we all start <unk> about which game worlds we'd most like to be fully immersed in half-life topped my list tied with <unk>
it took a few years but half-life <unk> has realized that potential and it's the best v r shooter i've ever play
with it valve has set a new bar for v r <unk> detail and level design showing what can happen when a world class developer goes all in on the new frontier of technology
in a lot of ways it feels like a game from the future and one that the rest of v r gaming will likely take a good long while to match much less surpass
the last of us part two is a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor taking strides forward in nearly every way
ellie steps into the spotlight and carries the sequel in a manner that feels like the culmination of everything that's made naughty dog's blockbuster storytelling so memory
it delivers a layered emotionally <unk> story on top of stealth in action gameplay that improved the first game's mechanics while integrating a bit more of <unk> greater mobility in action
but while part two is a thrilling adventure it still makes time for a stunning nuanced exploration of the strength and fragility of the human spirit
the playstation four has one of its finest exclusive in one of the generations best games
microsoft flight <unk> is legitimately incredible it's difficult to fully describe how amazing it feels to jump into a plane and just fly to and from literally any place in the entire world
the base games twenty included aircraft feel like more than enough for even hardcore aviation enthusiasts
and the ability to tailor the experience to whatever skill level you desire makes it suitable for anyone looking to fly the friendly skies from the comfort of their homes
the real world mapping data however takes flight <unk> for being just an impressive game to the most
and limitless simulation i've ever experienced in spite of its
seeing famous landmarks landing at the world's most recognizable airports or just touching down in a remote landing strip in south america is mind-boggling cool
and absolutely unparalleled way to virtually explore our world
<unk> is a one of a kind hero shooter that is far and away the best of its genre it offers a variety depth and style that very few come close to matching
its four-year-old foundation has been lovingly crafted into the unparalleled multiplayer experience that offers today from its now cherished characters expertly crafted maps
an outstanding sound design is a masterpiece of competitive gameplay most importantly of all though it's never stopped being ridiculously fun after all these years
all of these factors combine to make <unk> a singularly special shooter and one that i would recommend to anyone without hesitation
persona five was already a strong <unk> for being the best j r p g ever made and royal really gets me wondering what else could even compete
the excellent story and it's lovable <unk> characters along with the challenging tactical combat are all refined and back for another round with new surprises and new friends until
there are new areas to explore and new twists to leave your jaw on the floor very little has been left untouched and just about everything that has been touched is better off for it
the phantom thieves have stolen my heart all over again and i don't really want it back
i wasn't sure what i wanted to have a sequel of <unk> given how high the pedestal i keep the original game on how do you improve upon a game like that
but most mouth took its time and managed to deliver a masterpiece that improves upon its predecessor in ways i never would have even imagined
<unk> two takes everything that made the original great and expands upon each of those individual aspects without ever over <unk> the elegant retro simplicity of its two d platform
the possibilities for interactions between yourself your enemies and the environment are virtually limitless
which is a part of what makes every new run in <unk> two so unpredictable and exciting it doesn't do much to win over the people who already weren't fans of the originals unforgiving difficulty but as someone who is more than two hundred runs in
and feels like he's only scratched the surface <unk> two is a game that i see myself playing for a long long time
man those were great of course there is no alpha without the omega so
cooking mama <unk> is <unk> down by monotony poor motion controls and <unk> voice acting also having practically nothing new to offer
whether it's the lack of consequences for failure incessantly obnoxious mama the bland cooking mini games the <unk> multiplayer modes or the complete absence of meaningful progression
cooking mama <unk> is a tedious game that does almost nothing well
going into final fantasy crystal chronicles <unk> edition we expected a fair amount of old school design and were surprised to find that the story had been altered
but we never anticipated it would be in such a <unk> poor technical state on playstation four
unacceptable load times lack of local co-op and an arcane <unk> system makes playing final fantasy crystal chronicles a chore
a few simple quality of life improvements even if it was just the removal or shortening of load times would have gone a long way to gloss over at least some of crystal chronicles shortcomings when compared to many other dungeon <unk> you can play in twenty twenty
unfortunately the old school frustrations that weren't addressed only serves to date everything else about it almost completely <unk> it of any sort of fun
we'll be installing it as soon as possible and never looking back
aside from up to date squads this season's kiss and a new start screen fifa <unk> on switches virtually unchanged from fifa twenty
which was virtually unchanged from fifa nineteen before it and <unk> priced of <unk> <unk> dollars or <unk> <unk> pounds if last year's release was borderline insulting
this year's is just plain disgraceful <unk> please do better
but no circumstances should you play waking if you want guided meditation there's plenty of free apps for phones and videos on youtube
if you want to play a souls like this plenty out there including actual souls games if you need a game with psychic powers control is a lot of fun
avoid this at all costs and do almost literally anything else with your time
yeah we're gonna try our best to forget about those for more good games though be should check out all our picks for the best games of twenty twenty or if you want to look ahead have a look at all the big games slated for release in twenty <unk>
for more on gaming is good bad and everything in between you're already in the right place here at i g n
the console wars are entering a whole new era in <unk> as we move on to the next generation of gaming at a massive tech giant enters the picture
but as a gamer what new console do you choose or do you pick them all
well we made the choice even easier for you today as we picked the p s five up against the x box two and the google <unk> in the ultimate battle of console domination
this isn't just about brand loyalty as we break down gaming choices features graphics and online interaction to determine the ultimate winner
graphics comparisons four k graphics are the new standard in gaming and this is the bare minimum that will be supplied by all three consoles
the one <unk> internet speed playing a detail rich game like a <unk> creed origins could look very different at one home using <unk> compare to another
the google <unk> uses variable graphic performance based solely on internet speed
so if your parents are binge watching netflix while your little sister jams out to spotify you could easily find yourself playing a game at <unk> p with stereo sounding instead of being <unk> out at <unk> graphics with h d r video and five point one surround sound
the p s five and x box two were rely on disks and downloads to provide a consistent quality for a lot of the games
besides the <unk> quality each of the three consoles also aim to provide sixty frames per second as a standard for the majority of the games
in simple terms character movements are going to look incredibly smooth things like car races are going to be fluid and all those first person shooters will be even better than you could imagine
another way these console are all improving on the graphical presentation with ray tracing
the lighting technique includes extremely vivid graphics and will make everything from reflection to shadows look even more realistic than they already are
all and all each console is pretty much on power with each other in the graphics department with the p s five and x box two taking a slight edge because of <unk> reliance on proper internet speed
the controllers what are good graphics without a good controller to enjoy those games with the p s five and x box two both have a history of controllers their gamers are used to
while you can't expect more of the same from the x box with their pro controllers somebody is making vast improvements for their next entry in the dual shot controller
one of the biggest feature is a major upgrade in the rumble technology in the adaptive nature of the analog sticks
no longer will the controller just play out of the random <unk> buzz while you play
everything reacts to the surroundings you are in if you are an under cover agent who must climb their way through a snowy mountain side you'll feel the struggle of each <unk> as you move the analog stick around
driving a vehicle on a beach instead of the road you'll feel the difference as you travel through sand as opposed to the paved road
on top of that the trigger buttons on top of the newest dual shot controller are more sensitive than ever
blasting your way through levels of the laser gun will feel very different than playing as batman and throwing a better hand and the pressure you place on the trigger will indicate the speed in force rather than just a button matching
google <unk> isn't trying to reinvent the wheel with their controller either knowing what works the <unk> controller features dual analog sticks the typical input buttons and multiple triggers on top
if the dual shot controller works without any major problems or <unk> than the p s five edges out the competition for the innovative nature of their design
cloud game surfaces and speaking of cloud based gaming google <unk> is not the only one provide the streaming service
besides their typical game releases and digital downloads both sony and microsoft have their own subscription based streaming game services
the x box game pass is priced at ten dollars a month the end features over one hundred games with their rotating title of options including console classics
the ex cloud service microsoft runs on looks to expand the game pass to all types of i o s and android devices in the near future
the playstation now service has an affordable option of players are willing to pay for a whole year upfront
well the base price starts at <unk> per month a whole year costs around sixty dollar which equals out to five dollar a month
the p s five will be one of the best ways to enjoy the service with a huge library of past games from the p s two p s three and p s four all rolled in to one
the cloud based service also includes p c gaming through the p s now app the pricing discounts give the playstation cloud streaming a huge plus
but the x box game pass does have some exclusive rights to <unk> so there is that it is a little hard to compare <unk> options until the service fully rolls out but there will be a free plan
allowing gamers to hop on any google device and play the pro plan will include a number of free monthly gaming options as well solid state hard drives
the insides of both the x box two and p s five will show a major improvement with solid state hard drives
the massive improvement was years in the making and the more affordable hard drives will be a game changer in many ways
load times would be virtually not existed and the struggles of saving hard drive space will be gone as well with the solid state drive gamers don't need to download the whole game to play
not interested in the single player campaign just download the multiplayer element of the game and be on your merry way
not only will you be able to save hard drive space but the anticipation of playing a game will not take hours and hours
on the google side of things even though the <unk> platform will be available through the <unk> ultra and chrome books there are no downloads needed everything will be cloud based
saving some hard drive space and reducing loading time as google's high speed service provide all the loading and space you need for a whole library of games
game streams in today's gaming world does it even count that you have played a game if your epic skills or epic fails were not captured in some sort of game stream
well that's pretty much the case and the live game streams focus has been an emphasis for all the next gen consoles
microsoft is getting pretty serious about their online streaming platform mixer
the newest competitor to twitch will be integrated directly in to the x box two making it easy for players to hop online and broadcast their live streams
a picture in picture format also allows players to watch <unk> streams while they play their own games plus ninja has joined the mixer party giving the whole surface a lot of legitimacy and fan fair
i will be streaming exclusively on mixer
sony does not have their own streaming service but twitch is readily available for the console and will likely make the same transition with the p s five
meanwhile the power house of google has one of the most popular video streaming websites at its fingertips in the form of youtube
but the capture button featured on the <unk> controller players will easily be able to sort out content
upload footage and create all types of <unk> youtube content the youtube integration is huge for <unk> but the x box mixer service may edge them all out
ninja has garnered a ton of impress for his switch and by the time the x box two gets released the platform could've an even larger viewing audience
online play with the cloud based games huge downloads and an emphasis on surfaces like x box live and playstation plus online gaming will be bigger than ever in the next generation of consoles
and google has announced some pretty innovative changes that will helps at the <unk> apart the first is the buddy pass sick of having a friend who doesn't have the online subscription you want to play with
well just gift them one with the buddy pass anyone who signs up for <unk> founders package will be allowed to gift someone a buddy pass for three months
and that player can reap all the benefits another feature that helps the <unk> stand out above the rest the crowd play feature
enjoying your favorite <unk> in popular multiplayer game well the crowd play feature allows you to hop in on their actual game giving gamers a chance to play with some of their favorites
for p s five and x box two expect more of the same not that it's a bad thing but google major changes could lead to some new innovations for both microsoft and sony
give one to the new guy because google's online play definitely peaks a lot of interest enjoying the battle so far
well be sure to check out our video ten worst gaming injuries when you're done
free games who doesn't love free games well we are here to give you a break down of all the best free options for each of the next gen consoles
google is on the short end of a stick here as they rely on players making full game purchases rather than offering a whole lot of free titles
so far the only free game package with the <unk> premium edition is destiny to the collection
meanwhile you can expect both playstation plus and x box gold to continue rolling out their free game options
the free games have been a huge highlight to paying the monthly subscriptions on both systems and removing the feature with likely resulting a lot less subscribers
the free game feature is an ideal way for third party and independent publishers to showcase a variety of their games and gives players an easy way to build up their library
google definitely has a lot of catching up to do in the free game department but the company is also working on publishing their own games
so there could be some major changes and more access to games down the line
backwards compatibility google is the little baby among the bunch unless they decide to connect the services like epic games or stream do not expect a huge back library of game download and backwards compatibility
meanwhile microsoft and sony will continue to honor they're faithful making you want to dust off some disks in the long run
sony will allow any p s four disk to work on the console giving players a lot of time to stack up on games over the next year
meanwhile the x box two might as well be called the x box legacy because the console really blows all the others out of the park with its physical disk compatibility
the console will be able to read every single x box game from the original console all the way up to the x box one
this is a huge feature and will likely have us on <unk> snatching up old games we used to love
needless to say but the x box two has the major advantage in this category other forms of media
but we all love our hours and hours of gaming marathon consoles have become a lot more than just gaming machines so lets take a look at some of the extras
anyone who purchases the <unk> premium will get a <unk> ultra the h d m i device which offers streaming access to hundreds of different channels along with some live t v options like sling
naturally both the x box and playstation will continue their wide range of streaming channels like netflix hulu and newer options like disney plus
on the xbox side of things the exclusive <unk> content will help drive in sports fans meanwhile sony continues to promote their live t v service playstation view
the view is available on multiple devices making it an option for when the p s five is not in use
expect the expansion of the view service on the p s five with the some possible added features and extra content
not matter what type of video streams you enjoy all the consoles are pretty much equal in this category release dates
okay now that we all know about the newest consoles it's pretty much raised to the finished line to see which one will get released first
well google has a head start as the premium edition of <unk> will roll out in november although there has been some major delays due to the <unk> selling out across the globe
the <unk> is launching this year <unk> and nineteen
no matter when the various forms google <unk> <unk> do arrive it will be months in advance for the p s five and x box two
the sony and microsoft consoles are set for a holiday <unk> launch date giving google plenty of time to work out the <unk> build up on the hype and allow <unk> to become a household main
the latest rumor points to the sony p s five getting released on december fourth <unk> just in time to place a big old box under the christmas tree
let's just say that christmas break <unk> will be filled with a whole lot of games wow what a battle between some <unk>
the cloud service streaming definitely limits <unk> presence in the console wars but the ability to play on a pixel four also changes gaming forever
microsoft and sony are sure making some major improvements but time will only tell when people finally get some hands on action with the consoles
ether way we're all excited for the next generation of gaming
and now it's your turn which console has impressed you the most so far what features are you looking forward to anything great we missed
well let us know in the comments and stick around the gamer for more great video game content
we're releasing new videos that every couple of days thanks for watching and don't forget to subscribe to stand to date with our channel
this is a lot of boxes it's eighteen boxes right maybe nineteen

this thing we're holding right here is fourteen years old it's like a museum in here right now
tell the <unk> heads these are laces i don't like seeing them as michael jordan <unk> on the back
on the lower laces here we have the extra three <unk>
are those available for use or are those just for looks
i think you can use this it's gonna take a long time to get i'll do it if you
no no i'm just i was just curious if that's
i'll do it
okay
i didn't
should i have not done this
you know how much that shoe cost
no
get out of here no i'm just
oh
sorry not to
number four this box is great
i've noticed you reacted really strongly to it i knew what was coming so i
i'm stirred up right now
look at that
i love this pair
it's like a little bit of everything they're working on and yet it looks like a complete package
it does look like a shoe
it looks
and look at this
cardboard stick i'm enjoying this
number five
oh i like the shoe though this silver tongue though hey
i do not like this detail
it sounds like you're not a fan of the <unk>
it's hard to look at these
look at this
the <unk> opportunities
lot of options i feel like it was in ah <unk> era where everyone wanted to customize
i think burger king led the way then have it your way they were telling everyone that they could have it their way
and this piggy backed on it
that's really not true do you think the pace of it is going okay
i just feel like we're taking should we speed it up
three minutes per shoe times eighteen that's <unk> minutes we're looking at an <unk> video
i feel like i didn't do that well
things have obviously changed at this point i think the world is transitioning they want things to look more high-tech
this is the varsity red <unk> leather feels nice though
what is this is this a dryer sheet
this is a good one
yeah maybe the greatest year in michael jordan's career
<unk> look at that i prefer looking at the monitor than seeing them in real life actually look at that
i feel like they've kind of <unk> a little bit from the last one with the unusual color here but that's because
olympics
the olympics michael wins his third m v p award his sixth n b a scoring title of finals m v p award his second n b a championship and his second olympic gold medal
that's in one year nineteen <unk> m v p of the league scoring title finals m v p n b a championship an olympic gold one year
that's a special shoe should i wear these
i think you should put these on
right now
alright now push push
i feel like i'm the <unk> twelve year old right now
i'll take em number eight that is a very white shoe
i think we are back to a lot going on
yeah yeah maybe too much
i'll like them if i'm in the mood for something chunky
right that's a commitment that's a commitment right
this is a lot to liked in
look at the sparkling in there
it doesn't come together
yeah okay
it's like you like peanut butter you like jelly but you also like lettuce and those don't go together
i couldn't have said it any better number nine
number nine let's get it centered in the shot could you back
sorry i just noticed you were in the shot should we start over he was in see the shoe
stay back so we have an extra light but it's just dark are we rolling in this
not a fan
he's not a fan we're gonna we're just gonna keep moving
things are getting better now we're back in the realm now <unk>
you can't talk about the ten without talking about this sole talk about history you're wearing that on your feet
<unk> m v p championship <unk> m v p championship <unk> beyond
we're now back in the realm of that number four
i totally disagree i like that it's just ah a little ah bit of color kind of <unk>
yeah
little blue teasing you on the rim and you just wanna get in there and see what's down there
nothing else they're not too flashy
no
i think i know what's coming next because they're numbered and we just did ten
this is a different <unk> experience look at this you could start to tell right away you get the little pause going on these are number eleven but they're not just any eleven
check that out <unk> tunes we're talking about the space jam shoe look at the reflection there on that
i love that
if something's gonna get you fired up this has got to be it
i'm so fired up right now
something happened here
this is the first carbon fiber
i think this is the first <unk> in the group that i pulled out of the box and i feel like something happened
i feel like i wanna just give you a moment with these
let me have a moment
you want any water while i'm up
see when you talk about telling a story you talk about a shoe that's got ah something attached to it we said history earlier
of course this one the year jordan went off to make space jam the whole baseball thing the number forty-five temporarily
when you see this <unk> there's so much more that comes to mind
no
i didn't necessarily think i would have this type of emotional reaction to this particular shoe but it's happening right now
the magic trick
i had these shoes as a kid man that's something
i love this pair
wow
that's a distinctive look without being overwhelming
this comes together nicely
you notice details but from a distance it's a package you see the complexities
great contrast just like there
low tops
not my favorite
<unk> looking at it on its own you can see the inside of the shoe on the other side
that's what it looks like if your foot were in it
that's actually that works
rolls over easy this way but this way
can't roll over
i think if the jordan just tied to his career we still have one highlight left
same model he wore for his last shot just a different <unk> i love reliving that seeing him sync that shot unusual tongue
maybe the weirdest tongue we've seen it certainly looks kind of like what they thought was futuristic at the time
a <unk> of shoes
that's right
like i robot
<unk> they're not my favorite yeah they're not my favorite
i do like this pair
what happened it's like i just said it's what happened
this one i think it's now coming into its own
for real sixteen this thing is <unk> right
this is not that bad there's something happening with the this is not that bad
i like these without the shroud
yeah
i worry that i'd trip over this or lose a
seventeen
<unk> i don't know how to feel about these this to me feels more like a nike shoe that a jordan
this one feels like a some kind of a dress shoe to me
this stuff on the back yeah
he like going from the court to the <unk>
well said
thank you
i don't like this shoe actually this was the hardest one to find by the way this came from somebody's personal collection
hardest to get open too
no that's it that is the far it goes
no
yeah
i can get it out further
i'll do it later
i don't even this is i don't even it's unfortunate
this is the end though
maybe we wish he retired earlier to be honest
this is the moment right now where we each select our favorite out of the bunch i mean we just <unk> eighteen different <unk> here
who better than us to tell you which is the best you go first
okay michael jordan one it's the beginning i just love this shoe in an adult size
it's a great shoe it's a classic look i see where you're coming from the funny thing about this entire experience has been the less desirable shoes have been the hardest to find
the collecting part of it is only half the thing like some people want to wear this history
for me there's something about this package right here which just screams of a very particular era
this gives me positive <unk> there's a confidence here this is iconic to me
they all are in a way
they all are in a way that's up there too out of the destruction of that time period this emerged
i don't know about that
so there you have it every game worn jordan <unk> here thanks to my friend brad hall
thank you this is fun
so i made that video recently about the apple air pods they came back into my life i've been using the air pods and kind of enjoying it
they are widely successful you can see them out in the world other <unk> you know they're entering the space
this isn't the latest incarnation of the fully wireless samsung <unk> product
it has couple of features that haven't been seen before why is my favorite one is the frankly is this in entire setup
i can charge from any phone that supports wireless charge sharing because this is a samsung product and this is a samsung phone
there's also some interplay that's bit smoother than it might otherwise be with a third party pair of <unk> <unk>
but once you into the app this is where i think they have bit of an advantage over air pods they're super <unk>
here we can see the battery life of each individual unit you can use one independently of the other
you can keep of these guys charging in a case while listening to the other one
there are some <unk> settings here for base booze soft dynamic clear and so on
you can manage how these things deal with the notifications and they do have touch pads on side unlike the air pods
these have interchangeable ear tips and ear hooks as well look at all those options
the air pods that you've seen it before doesn't fit that far into the ear canal for some people this fits really well others they won't stay in their ears
these are on the other hand are gonna be a bit more predictable because they sit farther in ear canal and they have secondary rubber plastic component
they should just be a bit more secure in there considering the way that they are designed
air pod is a bit taller but also slightly less chunky than the galaxy bud
so people wanna know hey which one should i get considering that you can use either on multiple platforms
to work it's bluetooth <unk> you can use the air pods on android you can use galaxy buds on ios
within in the app there's also find my <unk> button so that will track these down these could be pretty easy to lose i mean they are tiny
also there is a pretty cool ambient sound option i can actually elevate the volume of the ambient sound and sound around me
so it will be amplified into my ear so i can hear my surroundings while i am listening to music podcasts <unk> and so on
now you can chuckle that all the way down so that it's muted you know what's going around me its muted
you are gonna have ambient if you are on the bike you're cycling you could hear if if a car <unk> its horn or something this could really amplify your surroundings
of course its not on the air pod has also the voice focus feature in there so this looks for voices specifically
and allows them to cut through that particular frequency range i find this to be useful from time to time
the other way that the touch pad works you can tap to play or pause a track double tap to play the next track answer or end a phone call
triple tap to play the previous track and touch and hold to use a user <unk> user's choice
you can that launch specifically do something specifically and that user <unk> and that's nice
now that i have a quick ambient sound i am gonna touch and hold it to see if i can lighten up the surroundings here we go
wow that's cool it <unk> the ambient mode while you're holding your finger on the touch pad i mean ambient right now i can totally hear my conversation and hear my own voice do i look a little strange doing this quite possibly
but the question you all have how did they stack up against the air pods now as you guys know i am an s ten user this is the device is currently in my pocket
so effectiveness of these <unk> it has to be have to in correlation to this particular device
we talked about some advantages with in the app who knows i might be willing to give up those extra features in exchange for potentially better sound i am not really sure
start with the galaxy buds i wanna make sure i've got maximum volume okay so i know i've got a max volume for a sample
one
okay
i were in soft right now dynamic clear base
um
okay i am wondering right now is it people who have been tested already had this in volume or not
because i read some of things you read and that was the experience i was having until i make sure the buds himself were max volume and the phone was max volume
now there's a lot more thump way more base are people doing it wrong
its a <unk> i'm hearing instrument i was gone for a minute it did trick sort of i've heard better kinda feel like i've to do this exact same track right now on the air pod it's like
right now without further due hurry up hurry up hurry up way less isolation i hear the fan on the camera here we go beginning
you know neither are are blown my brains out you know obviously i have tried some very expensive headphones in this spot in this seat right here
we have done it together you and i jack her whoever else happens to be behind here and give a day these are dental <unk> situations look at them
in terms of sounds i think i can say based on a real quick test right there the buds
it's there's a bit more thump to it maybe my expectations were too high
you're probably closer to this performance than they are to like a full on para <unk> performance
that said the most striking difference for me between the two is the fit the and the feel right
and the sound seal when you put these on you feel isolated but there's a drawback to that i noticed they are in my ears a little bit more
this i don't even feel it this is a a kind of a tighter feel if i had to choose this is a bit more comfortable for my particular ear canal
and that part of the reason i think i keep reaching for the air pods in the first place not because they sound the best but because you just not even notice you're wearing them that could be a good thing or a bad thing
neither are going to be an amazing audio experience but really these products are about convenience
so evaluating on them on convenience you have to give certain points to the new samsung product because of the fact that it can charge <unk> and off of the phone itself
also the app gives you more <unk> also another thing worth noting the galaxy buds are a bit cheaper than the air pods
so that's not much of a surprise that is hard pick i really don't know i mean it might be so simple as if you are on um on samsung or on android you can might go for easily
if you're on the i o s you'll probably go for these just for the easier <unk> across devices
oh it's a hard decision i had say if i am about to do some physical activity if i'm going for a jog or something i don't jog but like let's say i did
i will probably reach for these ones this is a bit more confident and in the fit but if it's just if it's in an environment like around the house
i actually really like the idea of not feeling the thing in your ear as stupid as that looks you'll forget that it's there
i already have so many great sounding headphones if i wanna get down to business with music i think i'll probably still reach for these more because of that factor
and then also keep my sony headphones the dedicated over ear headphones with the noise <unk> and everything else
keep those for that discerning listening but if i didn't have those other headphones and i needed something that could isolate better than the air pods
and i can only have one pair i only had a hundred and thirty bucks for one pair i probably go for these
so i only have one pair of headphones i'll probably would choose these over these but in conjunction with a really nice pair that you use sometimes
this is the i don't even notice i am wearing them head set that's the bottom line
okay so back in december twenty eighteen we made a video on one of the best options in terms of smart watches for android users and that was this watch the <unk> <unk> pro
and what was really unique about this <unk> was that it actually came with not one but two displays
yes one of them being an f s t n panel and thanks to its dual display panel the battery life was absolutely insane
so up to thirty days on a <unk> which was something that has never be done before
it came with the best specs you can get on a <unk> today
after an incredible price of just over two hundred pounds
if you wanna check out the full video on the <unk> pro you can find it here
but now <unk> has released a brand new <unk> for twenty nineteen it's called the <unk> <unk>
it not only comes with some extra features even offered to pro but it's also even less expensive than the pros
starting at just one hundred and forty-five pounds
and <unk> has sent one over as well as sponsored this video for me to take a look at
so let's see how good this watch really is for just one hundred and sixty dollars
or one hundred and forty-five pounds is it actually worth it's you know for this price um i'm quite curious i'm guessing some of you might me quite curious as well
so grab some snacks and let's have a look
okay so inside the box we get the watch itself the quick start guide as well as the charger
now with most android <unk> the charger has those charging panes and you have to line up manually the watch with the panes which i really don't like
now with the <unk> while the charger does have those panes the charger itself is actually magnetic so it automatically lines itself up
with the watch okay so who is the <unk> <unk> for and what does it do and in the end is it is it really worth it
well starting off with the who this is for while the <unk> pro was <unk> highest and <unk> made out of stainless steel and with a thirty day battery life the <unk> was actually made with fitness and swimming in mind
okay so it has weaker specs than the pro but it's better for swimming and fitness right
well to my surprise the <unk> actually has the exact in specs as the more expensive <unk> pro and in some cases it even offers more than the pro does
for example even though the <unk> does not offer the same dual display technology as the pro does it does have the exact in display the main display as the pro
so this is a one point four inch <unk> display at four hundred by four hundred pixels of resolution which at the moment is actually the highest resolution display on any android <unk> so text is razor sharp on this
colors just pop so everything is very vibrant on this display and since this is an <unk> panel you don't just get those perfect black levels but you also get
yes it's always on display which if you're coming from something like an apple watch this is a very very welcome addition
you know being able to see the time all the time on your display
and the brightness is really good as well and i haven't had any issues reading this in bright sunlight outdoors so yeah overall this is this is a great display
in fact ah this is the best panel that you can get at the moment on any android <unk> today
ah and the <unk> <unk> actually has it at just one hundred and sixty dollars
and interesting enough it's not just the display that's great ah the specs are really good as well
we get a <unk> <unk> i gonna wear <unk> hundred processor which yes it is unfortunately not the newly released <unk> hundred processor
but considering its price points and the fact that there are almost no <unk> using the <unk> hundred processors yet
aside from just three watches the <unk> summit two the fossil gen four sport and the louis <unk> ah <unk> horizon second gen
so yeah the <unk> hundred is the best you could ask for at this price the <unk> also comes with five hundred and twelve <unk> of ram
as well as forty <unk> of internal storage so ah add this to the <unk> hundred processor and the four hundred by four hundred pixel one point four inch <unk> display and there you go you have flagship level specs
ah on an android smart watch and and something that's actually priced extremely extremely competitive
and performance wise i personally haven't had any issues at all with <unk> ah so menus were fluid risk action happened pretty much in an instant
apps open very quickly and activating the google assistant was very fast
as well so yeah performance wise the <unk> gets my seal of approval
and since <unk> comes with google's operating system so wear o s two out of the box ah you get the exact same features as you would with all the other premium android <unk> so
ah you get access to google's full wear o s play store you get access to thousands of third party watch faces and you can even make your own
if you haven't found one that you really like so yeah you can create your own custom watch faces if you could choose to do so so i really really like this feature which is missing from you know something like the apple watch
and speaking of watch faces there are three of them that were made by <unk> and come <unk> ah on the <unk> <unk> and i really really love the way they look so they have this <unk> look
with red black and white so yeah they're really nice nicely designed and i i do love all of them
and now the getting through the menus is also very easy by the way and intuitive so you swipe up to access your notifications you swipe down to access your control <unk> or things such as brightness
low battery mode airplane mode and so on do not disturb um so yeah pretty much just like on your smartphone then you swipe right to access the google assistant cards
so things such as the current weather your plane ticket your latest news um all that will be there so yeah very similar experience to you know google now
then you swipe left you open up the fitness panel that shows you your steps and calories that you burned
throughout the day and tapping on this actually opens up a dedicated <unk> workouts app
and finally pressing on the crown opens up the app menu so this is where you can access your third party apps and system settings
and then holding on the crown activates the google assistant which you can also activate by using your voice by you know saying just ah the command okay google
i'm not gonna hopefully i haven't activated your devices but yeah you can start asking questions or ask for directions
ah weather all that so it's just like using google assistant on your smartphone
okay so great display great performance but what does the <unk> do more over other android <unk> aside from the very low price
well maybe other android <unk> today are water resistant for example the <unk> pro ah was <unk> <unk> certified so up to one point five meter <unk> up to thirty minutes
but the <unk> is a bit of a special one because this is one of the very very few <unk> that are actually <unk> not water resistant but <unk>
so the <unk> is <unk> up to five atmospheres of pressure which is about fifty meters of depth
so same as with an apple watch series two or newer you can take this ah with you when you're swimming or even <unk> yes up to fifty meters
so um that's ah pretty impressive especially at this price point and <unk> even comes ah with its own built it exercise app the workouts app that i mentioned before
which does include a swimming mode so ah now you can track your pace the duration the laps and even the number of strokes that you have taken
and <unk> also features a built in gps which not a lot of <unk> do by the way ah especially especially not at this price point
ah so if you just wanna go out for a run and take the <unk> with you this one is perfectly capable of doing that so you'd be able to track ah your path exactly where you run your run time
ah your heart rate and speaking of heart rate tracking the <unk> now comes with <unk> heart rate monitor two point though
which actually measures your heart rate continuously so twenty-four seven until obviously the battery dies
so most <unk> only measure every hour or every ten minutes ah or when you're doing a workout but the <unk> constantly measures your heart rate and then shows you graphs on how your heart rate was at different times
throughout the day and speaking of the battery um how is it well <unk> says that the <unk> would last you ah for up to forty-eight hours which is pretty good now personally
ah it last me for about a day a day and a half but it does depend on how you use it and you know what exactly you do with your with your <unk>
because for example if you go out on a run and have the gps on and you are also tracking your workout then the battery life would only last you for a few hours and this applies to any <unk> including the apple watch
okay so so far so good the <unk> <unk> seems like it cannot exist at this price point
so what's the catch well it does not have nfc so if you're into google pay then you won't be able to use google pay with the <unk> <unk>
and then the design is indeed quite chunky so it's quite it's quite a thick <unk>
u but aside from these two things you get a large <unk> display with no notch or <unk> you get the highest resolution display on any android <unk> you get a <unk> <unk> wear <unk> hundred processor
five hundred and twelve <unk> of ram and four <unk> of internal storage so all of these are flagship specs and the fact that it comes with a twenty-four hour heart rate monitor
a fifty meter water resistance and it only costs one hundred and sixty dollars at the moment so it might get cheaper as the time goes on
i honestly think that this is the best bang for the buck in terms of any <unk>
and if you use the coupon code zone of tech you actually get a ten percent discount on both amazon and the <unk> official website both of them linked in the description below
and probably ah the best part about the <unk> is that well it actually works on ios as well so if you have an iphone you can give this a try you can use it because it works
there you go if you ever wanted an alternative to the apple watch well the <unk> is half the cost offering features such as an always on display which the apple watch even lacks
but no matter if you're team ios or team android if you need an affordable <unk> that can literally do anything ah this is honestly the best option at the moment
so yeah this was a this was a really interesting video to do and it's honestly a really interesting product so yeah thanks to <unk> for sponsoring this video as always all opinions are my own
as in any of our sponsored videos but yeah feel free to check it out i highly recommend it
go give it a try if you use the links below we also get a small commission so you're also supporting the channel by doing so
ah yeah feel free to give it a try for a few days and see how it is both <unk> and amazon have a great returns policy
and i honestly think that you'll really really like it
yeah give it a try and then come back to this video and leave a comment letting me know what you thought of it
was it good was it worth it because honestly i really do think so yep
it offers so many features which at the at this price point no other <unk> does
but yeah thank you for watching ah do subscribe notifications for more in-depth tech videos like this one
i'm daniel and i'll see you guys in the next cool tech video which should be ah coming out in the next few days so yeah
keep it on the channel i'm daniel and i'll see you guys in the next one than a fact signing out

the great wall zhang <unk> sprawling historical fantasy epic the great wall has an intriguing albeit a little bit ridiculous idea
the great wall of china was built to keep out more than just unwanted human neighbors

who is imprisoned in his castle after her father offers her up in a deal to spare his own life
like a lot of stories from the era it's pretty dark

plus a cast that includes <unk> <unk> and sir ian <unk>
power rangers
the forthcoming power rangers isn't the first movie to capitalize on the mighty <unk> nineties craze of course
however director dean <unk> take on the story offers a much more serious and emotionally charged account
of how these <unk> teens manage to become a band of unlikely world <unk> battling back the forces of evil
if the film does manage to renew even a little bit of the power rangers frenzy that the series enjoyed in the nineties it's going to be massive
ghost in the shell
rupert <unk> adaptation of the popular ghost in the shell manga series of the same name

whose ranks included a raccoon like creature and an alien resembling a sentient tree into a two hundred million dollar movie
nearly seven hundred and seventy-five million in box office receipts later
the guardians of the galaxy could be the start of an avengers style franchise for the studio
while we don't have many details regarding what they will be up to this time around it's pretty much given that it'll be tons of fun
nobody has any tape

pirates of the caribbean dead men tell no tales
<unk> on the fifth installment in the pirates of the caribbean saga
started back when the previous sequel twenty <unk> on stranger tides was on its way to theatres
and its path to development has been strewn with script difficulties and budget introduce delays
still any new chapter in a franchise that's <unk> nearly four billion dollars counts as a promising development for the studio
and disney has stood by while producer jerry <unk> steered pirates of the caribbean dead men tell no tales to its destination
wonder woman

plus plenty of action and lots of <unk> to the assortment of spin off films the studio is planning
despicable me three
despicable me has grown into an impressively adaptable franchise for universal

the nineteen <unk> t v mini series adaptation of stephen king's it amassed a cult following
and tim <unk> original performance as town <unk> clown <unk> has set a high bar for anyone to follow in the role
so when director andres <unk> revealed his new version of the character now played by bill <unk>
in a costume that could have easily been borrowed from a school girl's dress up chest it's only natural but he faced a little blow back
there's still reason to believe this thing will be a hit though
there's tons of talent on board including <unk> and <unk> <unk> from stranger things

blade runner twenty <unk> director denis <unk> has a few big things going for him

although by the end of the decade the franchise had started to <unk> between stale and ridiculous
this latest overhaul arrives nearly a decade after the last reboot
which <unk> nearly a hundred million chances seem good it has to do with a guy in a hockey mask chopping kids to bits
what am i thinking
saw legacy
composer <unk> <unk> told the hollywood reporter that the eighth installment of the saw franchise would be a <unk> of the series
it's offering a fresh take on the material that will establish a new storyline and new characters that can carry the saga into the future
expect lots of blood gore and puppets involved in absolutely disgusting and terrifying acts
um my turn now ah
hey dan
thor <unk>
in norse mythology <unk> is basically the end of the world and the death of the gods
so it goes without saying that based on the title thor <unk> won't be a jolly good time for our hammer wielding hero
although we can guess from his imminent participation in the upcoming avengers infinity war movie that he'll emerge relatively <unk> after the final act
justice league
director <unk> snyder is hard at work on his third film in the dc extended universe the superhero team of film justice league

star wars episode eight
this is star wars we're talking about
so the list of things we truly know about episode eight is awfully short
pretty much all we can tell you is that this installment follows the events of episode seven
and advances the new trilogy <unk> the resistance against the first order led by supreme leader <unk> and his apprentice <unk> ren
oh an another thing it'll probably sell a couple of tickets
thanks for watching click the bell icon to subscribe to our youtube channel plus check out all this other cool stuff we know you'll love
buckle up you're about to be hit with a whole lot of talent welcome to watch <unk> and today we're counting down our picks for the top twenty actors of the last decade
for this list we're looking at the most talented high profile actors based on the performances they delivered between two thousand ten and two thousand nineteen
taking into account both television and film
we're not necessarily looking at the actors who generated the biggest numbers at the box office
but rather those who've distinguished themselves as being the most consistently <unk> earning the respect of fans critics and their peers
number twenty robert <unk> junior there are few greater stories of redemption in show business than that of this iconic actor
following a roughly five year stretch in the late nineties and early two thousands that saw robert <unk> junior lost to addiction he got clean and began rebuilding his career
in two thousand eight after proving himself in a number of critically acclaimed roles he made his first real blockbuster film ironman over the course of the following decade
this role would serve as the very heart of <unk> groundbreaking cinematic universe
and for anybody whoever doesn't like it there is the door
as tony stark robert <unk> junior gave us one of the longest running character <unk> in cinematic history and those sometimes overlooked because of the genre in which it plays out
it was a powerful and emotionally driven performance one that defined the decade
and i
am
iron man
number nineteen regina king this talented actor first came to the public's attention in the early nineties breaking out with performances in friday and jerry mcguire
baby this is us you and me we determine our world
baby you are a strong proud surviving splendid black man
but it's between two thousand ten and two thousand nineteen that she truly cemented herself as one of the most formidable talents of her generation king's best work has primarily been on t v
where she is held critically acclaimed roles in various series spanning the decade including detective lydia adams on <unk>
various characters on american crime erika murphy in the <unk>
<unk> butler in seven seconds and among her greatest roles to date angela <unk> in h b <unk> <unk> in two thousand nineteen
she won the best supporting actress oscar for her powerful performance in the film if beale street could talk
a child is coming
it's your grand child
i don't understand you
it's your grandchild
what difference does it make how he gets here
number eighteen adam driver though his characters actions often made him hard to watch adam driver distinguished himself as a talented performer
and one to watch over the course of the six seasons of girls after rising to prominence on the series he promptly began picking up increasingly significant roles
from his supporting part in two thousand <unk> lincoln to a <unk> role in martin <unk> silence
few actors have managed to simultaneously cultivate a reputation as a serious dramatic actor
and a star in blockbuster films but driver can apparently do it all
anything else
the two are accompanied by a girl
what girl
as <unk> ren he stepped into one of the biggest franchises of all time
while his performances in films like silence black <unk> and marriage story have earned him numerous accolades
and i loved you i didn't want to lose you but i'm in my twenties and i didn't want to lose that too and i kind of did
number seventeen jennifer lawrence speaking of actors who can score big both at the box office and in terms of award nominations
jennifer lawrence has made an impact like few others
the hunger games franchise in which she starred as heroine <unk> pulled in nearly three billion dollars at the box office
i volunteer i volunteer
i volunteer as a tribute
this decade also saw her playing a very prominent role in the <unk> franchise as <unk> over the last ten years she's simultaneously starred in a number of critically acclaimed dramas
which have <unk> seen her nominated for four academy awards including a best actress win for her starring role in two thousand <unk> silver <unk> playbook
that's great for all of them but all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help
i'm tiffany by the way
across the various organizations that recognize acting she's earned a massive amount of award nominations most of them over the two thousand <unk> before the age of thirty
number sixteen <unk> <unk>
nothing <unk> your status as one of the acting <unk> quite like ending off the decade with a best actress and best supporting actress nomination in the same year
alongside robert <unk> junior scar jo is a member of the team that <unk> the superhero genre over the last decade as the infinity saga played out
when filming one <unk> m c u film after another she's kept her resume balanced with more grounded roles not to mention daring and experimental ones
her willingness to sign up for sci-fi and action films has limited her award potential over the last ten years
but every time she does step into a challenging role <unk> reminds us she's an a <unk> in every way
i was embarrassed about it in front of him but it was also like
yeah this is who i am and this is what i'm worth
number fifteen margot robbie
it might be hard to believe considering her current <unk> <unk> but like jennifer lawrence this talented actor ended the decade while still in her twenties
margot robbie was <unk> into the spotlight with the wolf of wall street
you know daddy doesn't even get to touch mommy for a very very very long time
and despite it being a supporting role she proved herself to be an absolute scene <unk> since then she's further distinguished herself as an extremely versatile actor
regardless of how a film performs be it at the box office or with critics she shines bright her performance as harley quinn in suicide squad
as well as in films like mary queen of scots <unk> and i <unk> have been especially powerful
with the latter rightfully earning her an academy award nomination for best actress
number fourteen <unk> ali not every actor has their talents recognized in their twenties an established t v performer <unk> ali
first really caught the eye of cinema <unk> in two thousand eight the curious case of benjamin button as the new decade began however his name recognition and clout quickly <unk>
his supporting role in the place beyond the pines garnered praise and he soon found himself landing roles like boggs in the hunger games franchise and <unk> <unk> in house of cards
the more they give the more you can do the more you can do the better they look
two thousand and sixteen was a real turning point though moonlight enabled him to showcase the depth of his acting ability
what you doing in here little man
huh
do you talk to strangers
it's cool <unk> very cool
he won the oscar for best supporting actor and again two years later for two thousand <unk> green book
and also starred in the third season of the critically acclaimed true detective
number thirteen <unk> <unk>
i wanna go where culture is like new york or at least connecticut or new hampshire where writers live in the woods
those schools anyway
just look at that acting resume
between the performances that she's delivered in films like lady bird brooklyn and mary queen of scots <unk> <unk> has established herself as an incredibly versatile yet consistent actor
she can play an immature character without making them seem two-dimensional and yet she's equally confident when playing a royal with the weight of the world on her shoulders
in two thousand eight she was nominated for best supporting actress for her role in atonement over the last decade she's added three more oscar nominations
including the best actress and little women and three golden globe <unk> including a win for her role as lady bird the <unk> the limit for <unk>
number twelve daniel day lewis
i can't accomplish a goddamn thing of any human meaning or worth until we cure ourselves of slavery
and end this <unk> war
this icon only appeared in two films over the course of the last decade but daniel <unk> is not a performer who's worth is measured in quantity but rather quality
heck since nineteen <unk> he's only acted in thirteen films and nine of those have resulted in major award nominations
he's been nominated for best actor by the academy a staggering six times
and has a fifty percent rate of winning daniel <unk> is considered by many to be among the greatest living actors
and so despite only turning in two roles this decade he nonetheless made a significant mark on it
two thousand <unk> lincoln was one of his greatest performances to date and while phantom thread has less wide appeal day lewis still received universal acclaim for his performance
what game am i playing what game what precisely is the nature of my game you tell me
number eleven bradley cooper this guy has certainly come a long way
he went from a guest role on sex and the city to playing the bad guy in wedding <unk> to breaking through with the hangover
before ultimately establishing himself as an <unk> and highly sought after dramatic leading man
he first really showed us his worth in two thousand twelve when he hit us with the double <unk> of silver <unk> playbook and the place beyond the pines
i just can't believe <unk> teaching that book to the kids i mean it's it the whole time let me just break it down for you the whole time you're rooting for this hemingway guy to survive the war and to be with the woman that he loves catherine <unk>
since then he's delivered one critically acclaimed performance after another earning four acting oscar nominations
among his most notable roles was that of chris kyle in the two thousand fifteen <unk> american sniper
he also directed starred and sang alongside lady gaga in the smash a star is born
that's the thing about when you get famous people start saying your full name
number ten <unk> <unk>
and you know why i got this from mistress shaw
mistress <unk> won't even grant me no soap to clean with i stink so much i make myself <unk>
how many actors can you name who won an academy award for their very first feature film
not many but such has been the <unk> rise of this incredibly talented performer <unk> <unk> was born in mexico city but raised in her father's native kenya
after studying in the united states she returned there and got her first break in the worldwide m t v series sugar
after being suddenly thrust into the spotlight with her breakthrough performance in twelve years of slave however
she is proven many times over that her place amongst the hollywood elite is well deserved her performance in queen of <unk> garnered universal praise
her role as <unk> in black panther established her as an action star while her dual performance in us is nothing short of <unk>
it's our time now
i'll die up up there
number nine tom hardy
my name is charles <unk>
and all my life i wanted to be famous
in two thousand eight this english actor caught the attention of <unk> and critics with his powerful performance in the indie <unk> <unk>
he then proceeded to kick off the new decade with a breakout role in inception
at which point there was seemingly no stopping him warrior the dark knight rises the <unk> mad max fury road <unk> and that's not even including his television work
an incredibly physical actor who is able to convey complex and intense emotion even when saying few words tom hardy shines in <unk> and smaller films alike
one need only look at his polar contrasting roles in warrior and locke the latter set entirely in a car to appreciate his <unk> if only the academy would pay attention more often
i just got your message
is it it's a joke is it
look i know it's a shock but it will be okay
number eight matthew <unk> the early two thousand <unk> were truly a <unk> sauce it was matthew <unk> world everyone else was just living in it
after too often being dismissed as a rom-com <unk> for some of the previous two decades <unk> started demanding respect anew with two thousand <unk> the lincoln lawyer
you think you're the first one that ever threatened me and my family yeah
all i said was she's pretty
and he's scared of us
this is where you are right now
in a very dangerous place
it was a great performance but few could have predicted just how much stellar acting lay on the horizon killer joe mud and dallas buyers club followed soon after
with the latter earning him the academy award for best actor add to that his performance in true detective among many others and his immense talent becomes undeniable
had we been making this list in two thousand fifteen he likely would have been in the top five but some of his more recent films have admittedly been less well received
number seven emma stone
after her roles in <unk> and <unk> emma stone was fairly recognizable though not necessarily destined for the <unk> just yet
then in two thousand ten she starred in a little teen comedy called easy a and everything changed
let me just begin by saying that there are two sides to every story and this is my side the right one
stone was absolutely magnetic as olive <unk> and like that a star was born one that would rapidly rise over the course of the decade
the help followed in two thousand eleven for which she earned critical praise before really hitting her stride with <unk> <unk> and the favorite
which were all released between two thousand fourteen and two thousand eighteen
you had a career dad before the third comic book movie before people started to forget who was inside that bird costume
you were doing a play based on a book that was written sixty years ago for a thousand rich old white people whose only real concern is gonna be where they got to have their cake and coffee when it's over
the afore mentioned films earned stone three academy award nominations and five golden globe nods
with a best actress oscar and a golden globe to her name she is a force to be reckoned with
number six ryan <unk> speaking of <unk> that's just one of the many great performances this talented <unk> and former child star turned in over the two thousand tens
i want you to invite a new man man that's happy to be here very easy to work with
after distinguishing himself with his performance in the two thousand six film half nelson <unk> really hit a stride in two thousand ten with blue valentine
i'm being laden come here hold on this is what man i'm tired of talking i'm fucking tired of talking
from that point on the great roles just kept on coming two thousand eleven saw him starring in drive and the <unk> of march followed by the place beyond the pines in two thousand twelve
and while there have been some <unk> the big short la la land blade runner twenty <unk> and first man round out a decade of <unk> performances from this star
his two thousand sixteen golden globe was <unk> but an oscar is overdue
number five christian bale many an actor has committed life and limb to a role
but there's arguably no actor who <unk> more of themselves in a character than christian bale
and i'm a kip brother
is all us pity fighting around you know and we can't get to losing it's a manly thing no but we gonna we gonna break that one man be right
want him to be deathly thin no problem overweight you can do that in peak physical shape with enough notice consider it done while he's famous for radically changing his body to suit a role
that shouldn't be allowed to over shadow his incredible acting ability
as it so often does his supporting role in the fighter was absolutely <unk> the golden globe and oscar simply could not have gone to anyone else
and throughout the decade he is continued to deliver in a very consistent manner
including <unk> performances in american hustle the big short vice and ford v <unk>
number four amy adams this american actress often flies under the radar
even while turning in some of the best performances of the decade because based on her <unk> she should be at the center of attention pretty much always
adams kicked off the decade with a best supporting actress nomination for the fighter and got the same nod in two thousand thirteen for her role in the master
the next year she was nominated best actress for her role in american hustle
before landing yet another best supporting actress oscar nod for vice
so can you change
can you change or am i wasting my goddamn time
though she is yet to win the academy award she deserves she does have two golden globes for best actress and quite frankly the lack of recognition for her role in a rival is criminal
number three jake <unk>
not unlike amy <unk> this acclaimed actor tends to keep a relatively lower profile for someone of his status but his <unk> reveals just how talented an actor he really is
especially over the last decade he kicked off the two thousand <unk> with the critically <unk> but <unk> source code
before blowing critics away in a wide variety of films including end of watch prisoners wildlife and more
the academy hasn't shown him much love since <unk> mountain which is quite frankly shocking considering his performance in <unk> was among the year's best
i'm looking for a job
in fact i made up my mind to find a career that i can learn and grow into who am i i'm a hard worker i set high goals and i've been told that i'm persistent
he's just about the last actor we expected to see battling <unk> but wouldn't you know it he's just as good in a massive blockbuster as in a gritty drama or a psychological thriller
to peter parker to peter parker
poor kid
let's get to work
number two leonardo <unk> many have called him the greatest actor of his generation
no one needs to be reminded of the many award-winning films he starred in over the years but since we're talking about the last decade
let's review his astonishing feature <unk> inception jay edgar <unk> <unk> the great gatsby the wolf of wall street the <unk> once upon a time in hollywood
seven films mostly of the highest quality and even when any of his films <unk> this master of his craft never fails to turn in a solid performance
as the <unk> and the wolf of wall street remind us he is also very versatile when he steps into a character he truly brings them to life
he sure knows that
this is my home
so i guess what we're saying is if some of these people don't already have oscars they will soon has your favorite actor appeared on this list so far if not he or she might soon
let's look at the honorable mentions and then we'll see who clocks in at number one actor of the last decade
what
that was perfect
i'm in right here with detroit i got a life too i gave eighteen years of my life to stand in the same spot as you
don't you think i ever wanted other things don't you think i had dreams and hope
i ain't never intended to be no housewife nor slave in taking this job and it ain't right
these <unk> is more <unk> than any <unk> boys camp i ever seen
those are pictures of real things and all the other stuff you see on there that's real too
that's real oceans real trees real cats
no way what they all fit
they just do they just fit they just fit out in the world
i lived my entire life waiting for this moment
i train a lot i kill

number one <unk> phoenix
in two thousand eight phoenix announced he was retiring from acting thankfully it was an elaborate ruse for the two thousand ten <unk> i'm still here
though the divisive film was a <unk> that could have permanently <unk> a career
phoenix promptly recovered beginning with paul thomas <unk> the master in two thousand twelve which earned him a best actor oscar nomination
there have been precious few roles since for which he hasn't been heaped with praise be it in a smaller indie film or a <unk> smash like joker
whole life i didn't know if i even really existed
but i do
and people are starting to notice
like leo whatever role phoenix takes on he fully <unk>
whether a muddled <unk> a paralyzed alcoholic cartoonist or a <unk> <unk> he makes them all feel fully realized
commanding audiences with his <unk> and intensity do you agree with our picks

force choking i always hated that song
hello internet welcome to film theory the show that takes the <unk> most adorable meme obsession
and then turns it into cold hard <unk> learning as much as well bad mouth the empire heading up an <unk> government
it's got to be a hard job set the retirement age to <unk> and you only gets to retire before he can barely string a sentence together backwards
do or do not there is no try
but if you set the retirement age to like i don't know five hundred fifty han <unk> never gonna see his pension
wonder there was a rebellion against these guys now in case you aren't hip with the kids lately or didn't trample your loved ones in your rush to sign up for disney plus
i'm talking about baby <unk> the tiny <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the new disney plus show the <unk>
the baby version of a member of <unk> species who is in one episode already the most endearing character in this franchise
move aside <unk> get the boot <unk> baby <unk> filled the void that you never could
baby <unk> is like cute section but the kicker is that by our standards he's not even a baby the <unk> depicts him as a fifty year old toddler
their age that's all you can give me
yes they're fifty years old
by star wars standards that would make baby <unk> part of the silent generation by that i mean the one that came before the baby boomers which of course in star wars where all the babies that were born right after <unk> went
boom okay boomers there's one less planet in the galaxy
and listen this topic hits really close to home for me because i currently own a toddler
you'll hear parents saying stuff like i wish they could stay little forever but half a century of <unk> changes is something no one is signing up for
but all those diapers and memes got me thinking fifty years is a really long time to be a baby a relatively helpless baby
and i'm saying that as a human the species with the longest adolescence on the planet so how does this insanely long childhood happen
and is there any way that fifty years of tummy time could be remotely plausible scientifically well i started researching as i do
when it turns out that it's not just scientific precedent but an explanation here for almost everything that we know about the entire <unk> species
that's right understanding the biology of baby <unk> isn't just a fun fact from the <unk> or me <unk> a sci-fi franchise
but it's the single key to understanding the most beloved character in star wars history
and why he <unk> by the time we get to the main series of movies is pretty much the only one of his species left
to gotta say between this theory and the last one i did over on game theory about star wars this force being pretty much scientifically accurate which if you haven't watched
you absolutely should after this episode i'm starting to think that george lucas might secretly be a scientific genius almost let's not give him too much credit
so join me as i take a look into the evolutionary biology of baby <unk> and finally figure out why they're so cool and also why they're practically extinct
before we open your biology textbooks to chapter five we need to clear the air on one thing no i don't know the actual name of the species <unk> come from
but you know what i'm in good company because george lucas didn't either george lucas specifically didn't want <unk> species to have a name
and rarely sanctioned work that revealed information about their lore so even though the <unk> species existed in places like knights of the old republic the video game information about them doesn't appear in anything
that's officially canon anymore so instead of spending this entire episode saying the word <unk> and having to clarify between whether i'm talking about <unk> the species or <unk> the individual member of that species
i'll instead be referring to the <unk> species as the <unk>
because their <unk> have three digits right but bear in mind that's really just a <unk> designation for all the members of the <unk> species that we're currently aware of which are just three
honestly you got original <unk> you got <unk> from the phantom menace who just appears for a couple seconds and baby <unk> whatever his name ends up being from the <unk>
so with that bit of housekeeping out of the way and with the very short list of actual known members of the <unk> species what do we know about <unk>
we know that <unk> lived to the ripe old age of nine hundred in return of the jedi which everyone else is surprised about but he isn't seeming to indicate that it's not really that big of a deal for him
baby <unk> who's just stuck with that name for this episode i guess is fifty but functionally he's about a ten months old
if my kid is any indication he's <unk> but he is capable of walking and getting into trouble so we know
as a <unk> you get nine hundred years in the galaxy on the high end but at least the
first fifty of them are spent as a baby which i guess leaves like a hundred to make it through high school
another two hundred years of living in your parents basement before finally getting your own apartment at the tender age of three hundred
now because we're working in outer space and in a fictional franchise it's worth <unk> when they say that baby <unk> is fifty years old in the <unk>
does that translate to years as we understand them here on earth and it appears like it does according to wikipedia the <unk> standardized it's time based on <unk>
which conveniently <unk> its sun exactly once every three hundred and sixty five <unk> days which are broken down themselves into twenty-four hour increments
and then minutes that are incredibly close to our own minutes so when <unk> says that he's nine hundred years old it's pretty close to what we think nine hundred years is
and the <unk> has every reason to be surprised that his fifty year old mark was still a baby
so knowing that it's time to talk about the biology having such a long development period is more than just an interesting evolutionary <unk>
it actually tells us a lot about how <unk> may have evolved over time mostly because it parallels a lot of our own human evolution
you see most animals evolved to shorten the amount of time between birth and reproductive maturity so that they can go on and grow their population as fast as possible
but that's not the only successful evolutionary strategy you may have noticed that us humans have incredibly long and particularly vulnerable <unk>
when a baby giraffe is born it can stand almost almost almost right away so cute humans on the other hand not so much
it is taking months if not a year for a baby human to actually get up on its feet so why do humans the smartest animals on the planet
come out so useless
well it turns out that the whole issue comes down to our brains you see our <unk> heads and the fact that they're so fat have changed our entire course of human evolution
our ancestors who many believe emerged from sub-saharan africa were among the first species of animals to stop walking around on four legs
and start walking upon two our brains were big enough that we were able to logic out the idea that it took less energy to walk on two legs
and it <unk> our bald skins exposure to the extremely hot ground temperatures in those african deserts
as newly <unk> people our evolution started favoring other members of our species who could also walk upright good for us natural selection at its finest
but there's always a price to pay for innovation you see as we evolved to be more and more capable of walking
and running around on two legs our bodies evolved to facilitate that and compensate for our changed center of gravity primarily doing this by narrowing our hips
this in turn helped us to walk upright like <unk> and all of a sudden we had a problem that big fat head of ours was literally too big to be born
sure we had ourselves a big brain but now there was nowhere for it to go because our hips were too narrow to accommodate <unk> a head that huge
so human evolution had to change again as the theory goes we started having babies earlier in their <unk> period
earlier at a time when the baby was still tiny and <unk> and helpless which would be pretty darn bad for our survival except for one thing
the heads were still small enough to squeeze up on out of there still a very painful process but now at least it was doable
and then once the baby was on the other end there would be what's known as the fourth trimester
an extra trimester of development that happens outside in the real world where we as parents would have to take care of that helpless newborn
because technically it still should have been developing in the womb it just needed to be you know evicted from its home before it was too big to leave its door
now let's take a look at her friendly <unk> what features do we see well he's <unk> he's small with a disproportionately huge head for his highly evolved brain
he's got a short highly efficient body with <unk> narrow features including his hips even looking at the basic character model
you can see how in order to <unk> the <unk> would have to have themselves radically different proportions
you could also see how having a big brain is a huge evolutionary advantage humans are so far at the top of the food chain that we protect other members of the food chain
<unk> in the star wars universe are the wisest and most powerful force users in the galaxy
but the downside is that they like us are essentially born too early helpless for months if not years or until at least their dad makes them pay rent
and their mom stops doing their laundry this theory continues to hold water if we look at infancy for humans versus infancy for <unk> in their first two years
human baby brains grow to seventy-five percent of their full adult size we don't know if this is the same for <unk>
but we do know that the proportions of human babies <unk> the proportions of baby <unk> enormous head <unk> tiny body
besides making babies <unk> <unk> these proportions also serve a function in an infancy
human brains command up to <unk> percent of the total energy that the body uses at rest
meaning that even while sleeping the body is diverting a massive amount of energy to growing the brain
because of this the rest of the baby's growth legs behind the head where the brain is this according to the expensive tissue hypothesis
we can see that baby <unk> is an extreme version of this principle with a wildly huge and <unk> head
and a teeny tiny body making me think that baby <unk> is an extremely evolved version of what the human race could look like someday the
process of <unk> <unk> the development period is called <unk>
and after humans benefited from it surviving when our relatives didn't well evolution didn't stop its roll
humans are actually still experiencing longer development periods now than we even did ten thousand years ago
the shape of our faces and heads are continually becoming less like our neanderthal cousins by becoming flatter less hairy less oblong
again we share a lot of these same features with <unk> who's small flat faced with an enormous head but if human evolution continues to make our <unk> longer and longer
the question of course becomes where does it stop well it stops at <unk>
the problem with a long childhood is that a lot can happen when you're tiny and helpless
eventually there's an evolutionary tipping point where childhood becomes so long that it actually leaves the species too vulnerable to survive into adulthood
<unk> could very well be the extreme end point of a species like ours
as the <unk> clearly shows baby <unk> even fifty year old baby try <unk> aren't capable of taking care of themselves
sure they have impressive force powers but very little control over on them
human children similarly are pretty darn helpless and it means that we have to do things like <unk> the house and make up all kinds of safety rules for kids
so imagine having to worry about that sort of stuff for fifty or even a hundred years it becomes extremely hard for the species to get their offspring to a place of <unk>
and that's just the tip of the iceberg natural disasters plagues drone attacks from the empire
all of those things are gonna be pretty darn hard to avoid but they become a lot easier to bounce back from if suddenly your species can <unk> quickly
but if all of a sudden you're spending a hundred years or more to reproduce a single generation
i mean you're just begging for the next death star to give you a little <unk> which brings us to <unk>
we know so little about his history but what we're able to <unk> is pretty darn incredible he's practically the last of his species
because of the evolutionary double-edged sword that he's dealing with on one hand he's one of the most highly evolved beings in the galaxy
he's so evolved that his species can no longer survive they're completely obscure
it's incredibly tragic and no we don't have any of the details about how the <unk> were wiped out but that elongated childhood
that extended <unk> to the extremes of fifty plus years of childhood that is certainly a massive contributor
as to why so incredibly star wars the series often <unk> as being space fantasy
and not science fiction turns out to be scientifically plausible yet again so got to hand it to you lucas i'm pretty stunned
now i've tried to help you out with this and the whole <unk> powering the force thing but i got to admit still have some <unk> to level at you about the <unk> recruitment practices
now it'll be coming up ah pretty soon we have some bones to pick on that front okay friend in the meantime if you didn't see the real life equivalent of <unk>
and how they're actually powering the real life force in your day to day life click the video that you see on screen right now
that'll take you that'll take you to my other science of star wars episode over on game theory looking at <unk> mitochondria
and how we're all just a little bit jedi in the meantime remember that's just a theory a film theory and cuts
<unk> the <unk> and the royal birthday inspired by a a <unk> and e h shepherd with the declarations by mark <unk>
read by jim <unk>
you could tell christopher robin had something important to say from the way he clasped his knees tightly and <unk> his toes
everybody gathered round and looked at him <unk>
i've heard that her majesty christopher robin began ah squeaked <unk> in a state of great excitement
a royal highness he went on quite so quite so agreed rabbit the queen of england he said quickly before anyone else could interrupt him
who the queen said <unk> bear much relieved the other people you mentioned sounded much too tall and fearsome but the queen is quite different
<unk> had once sent a letter and was told to stick on a small picture of the queen it stuck more to his nose than to the letter
but it told the postman that it was most urgent and that the queen says it must be sent and so he was sure it had been
as i was saying said crystal robin passing <unk> a honey sandwich so that he might continue speaking
her majesty the queen is celebrating an important birthday her <unk> birthday and we should too celebrate it
that is by giving her a present
i had a present once sighed <unk> wistfully
two in fact if i may boast a little
one was rather small and damp and the other somewhat larger and sticky
but i don't like to complain
a present is something and to have two is something else
both <unk> and <unk> blushed slightly they had a memory of a wonderful balloon and a large jar of the best honey
that had begun as exceedingly good presents and then
due to various <unk> had become rather disappointing presents
but which were presents nevertheless and as <unk> had said that was something
the question is said rabbit importantly what do queens like best
honey i should think sighed <unk> looking at the small sticky crumb where the honey sandwiches had once been
i've heard said christopher robin who knew a great deal about faraway places like the other side of the forest and london
that the queen has a grand tea every day in her palace with buttered toast and <unk>
so i shouldn't think we'd need to give her anything to eat a present should be something to treasure
i've never heard much luck finding treasure sighed <unk>
but i did once find the north pole do you suppose the queen might like that
the friends thought this an excellent idea but it wasn't long before they realized that finding the north pole once was a very fine thing
but that finding it again was an altogether different thing
suddenly the forest seemed to be full of sticks that could or could not be the north pole
this will never do announced rabbit
do mumbled <unk> that brings to mind a little hum which i'd like to hum
if it was felt that a hum was called for at such a time of thoughtfulness and without waiting for a reply he began
the queen lived in her palace as queens often do
doing all those busy things busy queens do
but the queen could never know as you and i do
that doing nothing much can be the best thing to do
so from a forest far away for your special day
we're sending you some quiet and a little time to play
and quiet there was
the sort of quiet that makes the tip of your nose turn a sunset shade of pink
bear
announced christopher robin solemnly
that hum is fit for a queen that hum shall be the queen's present owl shall write it out and you and i
and <unk> will deliver it to buckingham palace and <unk> must come too because london is a very big place indeed
and even small animals if they are very good friends can make everything all right
and so it was decided and owl was called for owl <unk> here and <unk> there
and used up a good deal of time paper and ink but at last it was done and everyone admired it oh
<unk> who knew how important presentation was especially for queens took the hum rolled it
and tied a thick vine around it into the vine she twisted wild heather <unk> buttercups meadow sweet <unk>
and lastly a thistle kindly donated by <unk>
christopher robin also found a beautiful bright red balloon which he thought the queen might enjoy on gray days
<unk> you should hold it he said that way we won't lose you in the crowd
<unk> held on very tightly to the balloon he wasn't quite sure what a crowd was something like a dark cloud perhaps
but in any case he didn't want to get lost in it and was pleased the balloon would help
so the presents were ready and side by side <unk> the <unk> edward bear bear of very little brain brave <unk>
and loyal friend his small companion <unk> <unk> and christopher robin set off for london
of course london is on quite the other side remarked christopher robin as they were walking
of the sea asked <unk> somewhat alarmed
not the sea i shouldn't think replied christopher robin whose geography lesson so far had been mostly spent coloring in edgy bits
but but certainly the country or county i'm not quite sure which in any case it is very far off when we shall have to catch a train
i do hope it wants to be caught said <unk> who was already a little out of puff from the walk but the train was good enough to stop for them in the station
so there was no catching to be done at all and there was plenty of time to climb aboard and find four comfy seats
and then they were off
would you be so kind as to say very close by asked anxious <unk> as they got off the train at victoria station
he hadn't expected london to have quite so many legs
there were <unk> legs big booted legs and some legs balanced on pointy shoes which seemed to have a little stick stuck to the bottom of each sole
and they were all in a terrible rush and seemed to know exactly where they were going
christopher robin <unk> <unk> and <unk> launched themselves into this vast forest of legs and hoped they'd come out alright
they emerged into a busy street
christopher robin told them that the large black vehicles rushing past were called traffic
<unk> thought that traffic looked like giant shiny beetles and thinking of them as beetles made it less worrying
the friends walked and they walked
<unk> but <unk> sighs that had started out as small puffs were now growing so large and loud
that they were worried he would run out of puff altogether and <unk> the <unk> legs were known for their <unk> not their brisk walking
and <unk> legs were so short that they were hardly worth speaking of at all
so christopher robin suggested they ride on a bus the rest of the way to buckingham palace
most considerate i'm sure sighed <unk>
although slightly less <unk> this time
the friends have never been on a bus before and this was a most unusual one it had winding stairs
and up at the top there was no roof at all
as the bus began to move the wind did its best to blow <unk> ears right off and he nearly lost hold of the balloon
we'll call this the <unk> bus laughed christopher robin
the bus took the friends past a great many important buildings
and christopher robin didn't know all the names
there was one very grand old shop which <unk> found strangely familiar but he told himself he was being silly
as this was surely his first visit to london
at the next stop they were able to get out and stretch their legs a little
this is <unk> square said the driver look out for the lions
lions gasped <unk> in some alarm and there were indeed lions
but thankfully not the furry ones with hot breath and hungry eyes that they were imagining
these lions were cold majestic and their backs were shiny from where many people had sat upon them
oh how i'd love to have a lion christopher robin sighed
but <unk> thought that bears were best and pulled christopher robin back to the bus
the tour then took them past an enormous clock in a high up tower christopher robin told them that this <unk> largest bell was called big ben
i feel sure said <unk> that with this clock i could really learn to tell the time with smaller clocks i do try to tell it but it just doesn't listen
the numbers jump about so and the little hand <unk> the big hand just to tease it and o'clock isn't an o at all
and seconds aren't a little something more to eat and everything gets so terribly muddled
a clock like this though is sure to behave itself
but the friends couldn't stay to learn to tell the time because the next stop for the bus was buckingham palace
oh <unk> whispered <unk> as they climbed off the bus isn't it grand
and it certainly was behind golden gates windows rose up in every direction rows and rows of windows
and above it all the royal standard flag waved proudly in the sky
the flag means that the queen is at home announced christopher robin who knew a great deal about queens and such like because he had come to buckingham palace once before many years ago
<unk> well it's all very well for some complained <unk> i've never had a flag myself
but then i'm always at home one <unk> place is much like another and i don't hold with all this packing up
and farewell and see you soon <unk>
at that moment a <unk> sounded <unk> gave a startled jump and then continued jumping in time with the marching band
to show that it hadn't been a startled jump at all
the queen's guard marched past they were splendid in their bright red uniforms shiny buttons and tall furry hats
what do you think they keep under their hats <unk> asked <unk> a little out of breath after all his jumping
perhaps a little something to <unk> on just a <unk> of something sticky perhaps
sweet certainly
<unk> voice faded off into a happy dream
but all at once there was a stirring in the crowd and the murmur rose up it's the queen the queen is coming
<unk> and <unk> squeezed their way to the front of the crowd
and then they saw a sight that they had always secretly hoped for but had never dared imagined might really happen
the queen herself was out for a stroll and she was greeting the crowd as she went
she was just as <unk> and <unk> and wonderful as they had expected her to be
the queen was so close that they could have reached out and touched her fine coat
<unk> the <unk> knew that it was now or never
boldly he stepped forward
and recited his hum in the loudest <unk> voice he could manage in the circumstances
the queen smiled warmly at them all
behind the queen ran a little boy he was much younger than christopher robin and almost as <unk> as <unk> he caught sight of <unk> and the balloon
and he jumped up and down in delight
the little boy patted <unk> fondly and tickled <unk> the <unk> ears
<unk> handed him the beautiful balloon and he <unk> and skipped away with it
where's <unk> asked christopher robin anxiously as the queen walked on to greet other people in the crowd
with all the excitement they had quite forgotten about him
and then they saw him with his back to them staring up at the palace
i believe i saw the queen at one of the windows he announced proudly but <unk> began <unk> the queen just um
we must be heading home now interrupted christopher robin who couldn't bear to disappoint dear old <unk> who had missed the whole thing
later when the story had been <unk> over and over again <unk> the <unk> was sure that the queen had said how charming
but what was certain was that the hum had been shared and the queen had gone
she was back behind the tall golden gates of buckingham palace where no bear could go
do you think the queen liked my hum christopher robin asked <unk> as they walked down the mall
silly old bear i'm sure of it he replied squeezing his paws a little tighter
it must be a very great thing to be ninety years old mused <unk>
pleased to be on his way back home where a little <unk> of something were sure to be awaiting them
what the friends didn't realize
that <unk> bear had arrived in the forest in the very same year that princess elizabeth was born
but time is a tricky thing years begin by <unk> along slowly and then suddenly up there jump and off they trot as quickly as ever they can
to <unk> the <unk> it felt like just yesterday that he had come bumping down those stairs bump bump bump
and that is just the way it should be
<unk> exotic animals you can actually own do you wanna be another boring pet owner or are you looking to turn a few heads on your next morning stroll
with your newest animal companion well you could brave the mission and opt for a <unk> tiger like mike tyson but a full grown <unk> is quite a piece of work
and not exactly what we had in mind for today's list we were thinking a little more cute and exotic like the playful <unk>
or the fluffy <unk> fox perhaps even a <unk> <unk> <unk> or a dog sized <unk> like the australian <unk>
with a little extra research and work these bizarre and adorable animals could realistically become your next pet so if you're looking to turn a few heads
and melt a few hearts with your newest unusual animal friend stay tuned as we count down our top ten picks for the <unk> exotic animals you can actually own
as pets oh and if you thought crabs couldn't be sweet then stay tuned for number one
because this unique and exotic <unk> is sure to make your aquarium a lot <unk> okay let's get started
ten the <unk> on first sight you may confuse this large <unk> for one big guinea pig and you'd actually be right
the south american <unk> is one of the largest <unk> in the world it can weigh up to one hundred and forty pounds not to worry
you won't be needing a huge cage because <unk> are semi aquatic <unk> so scratch the dog sized <unk> wheel off your list
because this animal definitely needs access to a body of water in order to swim around like your pool
although mostly adorable and sweet <unk> can be a challenging pet especially because they're extremely social animals
so if you're planning on owning one it's best to make room for a couple more this <unk> is legal to own in most parts of the world
although some countries and states may require a separate license but those cute and furry <unk> are well worth the extra paperwork
nine the <unk> now we can't all adopt a royal <unk> tiger as mike tyson once did
but most cat lovers would surely love to settle for this wild beauty <unk> can even be litter trained if you start early enough
these <unk> african cats are accustomed to warm climates and <unk> spaces
for you pet owners it means you'll need a moderate amount of space for your exotic cat to feel at home
<unk> require lots of daily exercise and love to play so a spacious garden is probably your best bet
eight the <unk> fox as if foxes weren't cute enough we give you the <unk> fox
have a look at those ears they're phenomenal
these foxes come from the african continent and are the smallest breed of fox in the world
only reaching about four pounds when fully grown but the same cannot be said about the size of those adorable ears
if you never quite figure it out whether you're a cat or dog person the <unk> fox may become your favorite <unk> companion
hey what are you doing
cake
this <unk> behavior can best be described as a cross way between that of a dog and a cat
they're usually playful and energetic like a dog but just as equally independent like a cat so you'll be fine leaving them home alone for a few hours
what sets them apart though is that they don't really favor dog nor cat toys this exotic animal can live up to fifteen years
and is legal to own in most of america with the exception of a few states but hey if you're dying to own one you can always just move to another state
oh my god
seven box turtles
although they can be tricky to care for box turtles make some cute and seriously long term <unk> companions like most turtles
they carry their homes on their backs and this species can live for up to fifty years
which may seem like a lot for a household pet but is laughable when compared to jonathan the world's oldest turtle at one hundred and <unk> years old
box turtles like the soaked in water from time to time to <unk> and cool down
but that doesn't necessarily make them pro swimmers in fact they're actually land turtles
they looked pretty clumsy while doing it so despite their sharp <unk> rough <unk> skin and tiny pointed claws
a box turtle can make a pretty darn cute addition to your <unk>
six the <unk> from <unk> to <unk> <unk> have a reputation as one of the <unk> household pets
but on the more exotic end of the spectrum and perhaps ten times more adorable is the <unk>
the <unk> <unk> can bond very closely with its caretaker
but unfortunately is one of the more destructive <unk>
that's not to say they're dangerous or anything they just don't like to be cuddled
no no no no no ow ow ow you bit me hard
at least not nearly as much as they love to run around to play they're quite active and get bored pretty easily
so you'll need more than a plain old <unk> wheel to keep these little guys busy
but we're sure you'll agree those gigantic ears and that fluffy tail are well worth the extra effort
five the sugar glider
if you've ever wondered what it's like to own a flying squirrel
then you should purchase a sugar glider while squirrels can't be domesticated sugar <unk> are the next best thing and many would agree a lot <unk>
just look at those eyes
although the two looks similar sugar <unk> are actually part of the <unk> family just like <unk>
the females glider doubles as a pouch where they raise their young until they're old enough to fly off
i mean glide off on their own
if you're wondering where they got the name it's because they love to eat almost anything that is sweet especially fresh fruit and vegetables
the best part about these australian natives that they love <unk> with their caregivers and get along great with other animals
four the <unk>
<unk> is are small golden brown honey bears that are native to <unk> and have become increasingly popular as pets
celebrities such as paris hilton is known to own a <unk> and a sugar glider but the rich and famous aren't the only ones who find these animals adorable
no no don't eat that no
take it just grab it
making the decision to care for a <unk> isn't to be taken lightly though as these nocturnal animals like to get into things and can be pretty messy
three the <unk> <unk>
creepy <unk> but still kind of cute despite the preferred diet of crickets and <unk>
the <unk> <unk> has a pretty <unk> smile and tiny hands
just look at them they're so tiny in the eyes well we'll leave it up to you to decide
but one thing's for sure the <unk> <unk> is one of the <unk> reptiles you can own
their low maintenance care and funny personalities have made them extremely popular pets
because they're so simple to care for <unk> <unk> make excellent pets for kids and beginner reptile parents
it is now time for today's subscriber <unk> we asked our subscribers to send in their pictures for their <unk> exotic animals in today's thumbnail <unk> was sent to us by a subscriber wondering about
this incredible picture of a small monkey hanging with a human finger so we looked into it and it turns out that it's a finger monkey
<unk> <unk> that is the smallest primate in the world very close to our number two pick for the list their babies are five to six inches tall in length
and weighs around one hundred grams these <unk> monkeys are indeed the <unk> animals in today's video but we cannot include them in our list
because they are illegal to own in most parts of the world
two the <unk> monkey
the cute <unk> monkey is a primate that is often seen in movies and television it is famous for its small size and known for its playful mischievous attitude
remember jack <unk> monkey in pirates of the caribbean
they are highly intelligent territorial and will live up to forty years that's forty years of diapers unless you could teach your monkey to use the toilet
before we reveal number one be sure to check out other amazing videos on our channel and give us a like if you enjoyed this video so far
tell us in comments which one of these you liked the most and why
one the hermit crab
if your definition of a pet is sweet and fluffy then underwater <unk> probably aren't the first thing that come to mind
but here is one little <unk> that can make your aquarium just a little bit <unk> not just for its bulging eyes but because of its distinct personality
unlike most crabs <unk> have a smaller soft abdomen
which they <unk> protect by living in an empty snail shell
they must continue to find larger shells as they grow in size so the owners of these pets must provide progressively larger shells over their lifetime
creating a very special bond between caregiver and animal
her eyes and ears were closed for the first two weeks of her life and now opening
and with this comes a whole new world of sensory stimulation
she uses her vision to move around
but does she see the world the same way we do
well dogs are colorblind
but that doesn't mean that everything is black and white
she does see color but mostly just blues and yellows
it's because she only has two types of color receptors compared to humans who have three
and it's also why your dog will often ignore an orange toy in the green glass
as those colors look the same to them
better to give them something blue
but it's when things are moving that her vision comes into it's own
dogs eyes process what they see more quickly than we do
it's almost like they see in slow motion
that's why they're always in the right place to catch the <unk>
psychology professor john <unk> was interested in finding out how many words a dog could learn
and seven years ago he found the perfect student <unk>
using crate load of toys john and his colleagues devise a ground breaking study of <unk> intelligence
the toys all have names that <unk> has learnt through out her life and john picks eight at random
chase let's pace up chase find punt go get punt right pop pop punt do it girl do it
yeah <unk> yeah good girl chase find <unk> find <unk>
find <unk> i want <unk> good girl
john never looks at the toys on the mat so to pick the right object <unk> has to actually understand what he's saying
yeah there's whale pick it up pick it up
in three years of intensive training <unk> has learnt an astounding one thousand and twenty-two words
that's a hundred and sixteen balls <unk> <unk> and over eight hundred cloth animals but how does she do it
on the mat are five items <unk> knows and one new one she's never seen a cat that john call <unk>
chase find <unk> find <unk> find <unk> do it girl do it do it do it do it girl beat papa
this task involves highly complex logic the new word isn't in <unk> vocabulary so she has to understand
that it might refer to an unfamiliar object
chase give <unk> i want <unk> do it girl do it right now
the way to solve the puzzle is by a process of elimination
get <unk> do it do it
there is <unk> come here
after only one trial the new toy and the sound <unk> are lodged in her brain
watch <unk> catch <unk> good girl
and it just goes to show that you can teach an old dog new tricks to see african wild dogs in the flesh is a real privilege
it's thought there may only be three thousand left in the wild making them one of the most endangered mammals in africa
<unk> the alpha male where's the radio collar
it really is quite fascinating to watch the alpha pair always together always together
the male is constantly <unk> behind her wherever she goes
<unk> and feather have only been together for four months but they're already off to a flying start feather is visibly pregnant
but even though he's now done the job she is pregnant with his <unk> he doesn't leave her side for one minute
it's unusual for an alpha male to be so attentive at this stage <unk> seems to be a particularly devoted partner
<unk> has been monitoring feather and <unk> progress from the start so tell me a little bit about how <unk> and feather behaved with each other as the alpha pair
we've often seen him with his chin resting on her rear end and just following her around and he's been observed sleeping with his paw on her neck
its typical it's what we call mates guarding behavior he's looking after her he's making sure that she's that she's fed and healthy
once she's pregnant he continues to follow her even though he's already done his job and <unk> her litter
and i think that's his way of ensuring that his litter of <unk> survives and and is healthy
<unk> and feather look like a solid couple
and that's good news for everyone else in the group
because as the alpha pair it's their job to provide the pack with new <unk>
so is that it are they completely established and their roles are determined and everything's <unk> with the whole pack
well so far so good the the key will be how successful they are at raising that litter of <unk> as a pack
and the success of a pack always depends on on the on the reproductive says success so how well they work together to successfully rear their young
so they're not home free
not at all not at all
so whenever you get a new alpha pair it doesn't mean anything until they've successfully reared their first litter oh gosh it's no pressure
fortunately for <unk> and feather the rest of the group will be there to lend a helping hand
the other adult females are <unk> sisters and the <unk> come from different packs
you have to come rest behind us
it's one big happy family where everyone pitches in
there are a few places on <unk> where people live year round one of them is the polish research station at <unk>
they've had bears visit them this year but no fatal <unk> thanks to tried and tested polar bear warning system
<unk> that's my daughter's name
<unk> <unk> has worked at the base for almost a year
she's the <unk> one
so if a polar bear walks walks in the dogs start barking and scared do they scare it off most times
dogs like <unk> bark as soon as they get a whiff of a bear
this gives the researchers time to come out with a flare gun and scare it off
for <unk> here how close has she been to a polar bear
well she was attacked four years ago
was she
yes she had some stitches on her here over here on the leg
after she was attacked by the polar bear did her attitude change towards him was she more scared
no she just got more brave
just almost a job from the polar bears that you've seen come through here have have you noticed that some are more curious that they do have different personalities
yes yeah some ah are scared once and they go away some are really just
so starving so so hungry
i do think it's great the way that the dog senses are used to keep people safe from polar bears they've got an excellent hearing fantastic sense of smell
and there's absolutely no technology in the world that can detect polar bears as good as a dog can
it's a small sign of hope there are ways to keep both people and polar bears safe
max is a red <unk> cross normally full of energy and enthusiasm
but in two thousand and eight his owner maureen burns noticed that something was wrong
i thought at the time max was fading he was nine and a half
and i was preparing myself for losing him because of he just wasn't happy wouldn't come with me wouldn't sit by me wouldn't sit on my lap
and the odd signs he would come up
and touch my breast with his nose
and back off so desperately unhappy but there's such a sad look in his eyes
maureen had a small lump in her breast but her latest mammogram was clear so she presumed all was okay
initially i thought um it's just another <unk> breasts as people get
but then
i sort of connected it with the dog with his odd behavior and one day i was looking in the mirror in the bedroom here
and i looked across in the mirror at <unk> eyes he was on the bed as he is now and i knew it was cancer
maureen went to her local hospital but both a scan and a mammogram came back negative
it took a surgical biopsy to finally detect the cancer
maureen had it removed and the change in <unk> behavior was instant
the day i was picked up from the hospital
he was his old hyper self again
he put his nose across my breast to check where the operation had been and he was wagging his tail and his eyes were happy and
it was unbelievable the change in him instant
i love max so much and i owe him so much
and even before i go for a <unk> now i get him to check me out and if he's happy and wagging his tail i am happy
and i know i'm okay
we now know that dogs like max are smelling the tiny volatile chemicals given off by <unk> tumors
most dogs can do this they just don't know that we're interested
but with a little training dogs can accurately pick out a <unk> patient from a selection of urine samples
good girl good girl
they can even be taught to let <unk> like steven know that his blood sugar levels are smelling low long before he can feel it
and definitely before he passes out
dogs like steven are now transforming lives all over the country
they're being trained to detect the early warning signals for severe allergic reactions <unk> fits and <unk>
i worked at this place c c w i
and for my <unk> current project which was the <unk> operating system which ah i was working under <unk> <unk>
one of our projects was to write application level utilities
for this new <unk> operating system
and so there was an operating system kernel and it was very good at talking to the network
and it was very good at managing processes but there wasn't much user level software
there was barely a shell i think that was reported very old <unk> shells something like the original version <unk> version sick shell
but because the file system model on <unk> was so very different
ah we couldn't take an existing suite of <unk> utilities
and so we wanted it to be <unk>
and in order to do that we realized we needed a large amount of user level sort of applications utilities tools
whatever you call it from a from an editor to a mail program to a a login utility and a backup tool
and one of the things i realized as we had a small team of people sort of working on those things
that it was very slow going writing all that stuff in c and it wasn't particularly interesting or sort of novel
or difficult and often we also didn't really care how fast the code ran
all the reasons why you would write a piece of software in c didn't really apply
the only reason left was that c was the only <unk> language that for which we had a compiler
there was is a b c language that i had in the back of my mind that would be a much better language to write
a whole bunch of utility application tools for <unk>
except that a b c was so high and abstract that it really
it's it wasn't a good language to talk to servers and file systems and processes
and it sort of the whole operating system thing was abstracted away from a b c
it was almost something like it i don't know in the dig in an alternate universe a b c could have become the language of spreadsheets
it was very good to for talking about a user's data
and doing all sorts of clever stuff with that data
and it did that using very sort of general <unk> data structures like lists and dictionaries
and of course it had very nice codes <unk> devices
like a small number of simple statements that could be combined in any way you wanted to create other constructs
the usual function and procedure ah abstractions
it was not at all an object oriented language although the implementation had some objects sort of shining through
anyway a b c s
as it existed still wasn't usable
but i somehow since i had worked on the a b c project i knew exactly how it was built
and i had this idea at my head that
given how much time we had available for our project i could actually build a whole new language designed and implemented from scratch
given what i learned about both the design and implementation of a b c and start using it to implement our suite of tools
and still be ahead of the game compared to a situation where we would just have sort of
<unk> on writing the things we wanted to write in c
for three months
i i did my day job and at night and whenever i got a chance i kept working on python
i believe that within three months i was to the point where i could tell people look here this is what i built
and it had an interactive interpreter loop
so the the first demos were all let's assign an expression to a variable and print it back
ah and let's define a small function and call it and let's put some let's put some things in an array and it's rate over the array
and all those things worked
ah and
somehow and i i i don't exactly know sort of how fast this happened but
certainly my two <unk> were almost instantly taken with it and started helping out
and they and the few others within the institute were very excited about this thing that i'd built
ah and started sort of
of course we we didn't instantly use it on <unk> because it wasn't mature enough to actually write the <unk> utilities that we wanted
but it was already instantly useful enough for our to to run on our <unk> system
people within c w i even outside my own department started using it
and recognizing that it was fun and productive to use and they used it for small scripts
and people started contributing things like
bug fixes somehow things went went very quickly during that first year
because i think by the end of nineteen ninety so a year after i started we developed a plan to do an open source release of this language
and this was before the word open source had even been coined
so we didn't call it that but we we did have some models we had like ah
<unk> the window system at the time
ah had a distribution that was one of the the sort of open source examples
with two colleagues i worked um sort of building a distribution and we we
actually i it turned out to be very simple
to gets management to sign up from this release
that that was an incredibly lucky stroke
i just sort of
i asked my <unk> manager what shall we do about this
and he said oh you gotta talk to this and this person in the administrative branch of the institute
and i talk to this woman and she was like in charge of all legal affairs i believe
and i said well i have written this source code and i would like to release that and i have sort of
made up a license that's like identical to the m i t license how could you m i t releases software under exactly this license
and we just put like the formal name of our institute in there instead of ah the regions of the institute
she ask me some questions like
did someone pay for the for this to be developed and i answer was no i i started this started this all in my own my own time
and it was for this research project that's sort of
my manager is fine with it
and so she said sure go ahead and we did it
and that so that in in february <unk> we did the first python release
it it felt like at the time like an incredible milestone we we needed to post it to use net
there was this use net news group that ah would receive source code for a random free projects
i got immediately started getting useful positive feedback from well initially just from a random people
who picked up ah free software from ah use net and
we we quickly sort of got in to a routine of doing new python releases
and every time
i mean there were ah the obvious improvements to the language and the library and bug fixes ah very important category of things that were often contributed
were ah ports or <unk> fixes where people had different architectures different <unk>
the the the <unk> world was much less homogeneous at that time there were lots of small <unk> vendors that had their own <unk> or their own hardware
all sorts of things so the the big things that happened
during say the first half of the nineties was a community of python users and developers <unk>
then came the invitation to come to the united states for ah a couple months
from <unk> the national institute for standards and technology so i spent two months there
ah we organized the first python workshop which was hosted by <unk>
through that python workshop i met people who offered me a job and from <unk> i mean i went back to the netherlands for a few months and then from <unk> to two thousand
i worked in u s in northern virginia at the c n r i
and so there we worked through a lot of growth of the community and the infrastructure we created python website
ah i got in touch with bunch of people who are still active in the python community like they were so
i think when i started there python one point three was about to be released
and then while i was there we released several subsequent versions leading up to one five two
which for some reason one one five zero was nothing
but one five two remained the sort of the standard the gold standard of python for a very long time afterwards
but get back to standardization we are <unk> c plus plus on the i s o rules which are very open process
people come in there's no requirements for education or experience
c third develop c plus plus and there is a whole what was the first standard establish what is that like
ah the iso standard is there committee that you're referring to is a group of people what what is that like how often do you meet what is this
i'll i'll try and explain that so some time in early nineteen <unk> um
two people one from i b m one from h p turned up in my office and told me i would like to standardize c plus plus
this was a new ideas for me and ah i pointed out that's it wasn't finished yet it wasn't ready for formal <unk>
but they said no <unk> you haven't gotten it you you really want to do this um all organizations depend on c plus plus
we can not ah depend on something that's owned by another corporation that might be a competitor of course we could rely on you
but you might get run over by a bus
we really need to get this out in the open it has to be ah standardized under formal rules
and ah we we are going to standardize it um under i s o rules
and you really want to be part of it because basically otherwise we'll do it ourselves
and we know you can do it better ah so ah through a ah combination of arm twisting and ah <unk>
so in late
in late <unk> there was a meeting in d c at the ah actually no it was not i s o then it was n c
the american national standard would doing
we met there we were <unk> on the rules on how to do an n c standard there was about twenty-five of us there
which apparently was a new record for that kind of meeting um and um some of the old c guys that has been <unk> c was there so we got some expertise in
so the way this works is that it's an open process anybody can can sign if they pay the minimal fee
which is just about a thousand dollars it was less it's a little bit more now
and ah i think it's twelve hundred and eighty dollar it's not it's not going to kill you and we have three meetings a year
this is very standard ah we tried two meetings a year for a couple of years that didn't work too well so three week it's three one
week meetings a year
and you meet and you have taken what it meet is technical discussions and then you bring proposals forward for votes
the votes are done one person per
one vote per organization so you can't have ah say i b m come in with ten people and dominate things that's not allowed
and these are organization that extensively use c plus plus
all individuals
all individuals i mean it's a it's it's a bunch of people in a room deciding the design of a language based on which a lot of the world's systems run
that's right well i think most people would agree it's better than if i decided it
or it better than if a singular organization like h n t decide it
i don't know if everyone agrees to that by the way bureaucracies have their critics too
yes they they there look standardization is not pleasant it's it it it's horrifying
take democracy
but we exactly ah as churchill says democracy is the worst way except for the others right
and it's about say the same reform standardization but anyway so we meet and we ah we have these votes
and that determines what the standard is couple of years later we extended this so it became worldwide
we have standard organizations that are active in
currently fifteen to twenty countries and ah another
fifteen to twenty are ah sort of looking then voting
based on the rest of the world comment and we meet three times a year ah next week i'll be in cologne germany
ah spending a week ah doing standardization and we'll vote out the committee draft of c plus plus twenty
which goes to the national ah standards committees for comments and request for changes
improvements then we do that and thus the second ah set of votes where hopefully everybody votes in favour this is happens several times
first time we finished we started in the first taken home meeting was in nineteen ninety the last was in <unk>
we voted it out that was a standard that people used till eleven or little bit past eleven um and it was an international standard
all the countries voted in favour um it took longer with eleven i don't know mentioned why
but all the nations voted in favour ah and we work on the basis of ah consensus
that is we do not want something that passes <unk> ah because then we are getting gonna <unk> it's not improvement in people complain too much
then they will complain too much but basically it has no real effect the the standards has been obeyed
they have been working to make it ah easier to use many <unk> many computers and all of that kind of stuff
and so the first they there is traditional with i s o standards to take ten years we did the first one in eight brilliant
ah and we thought we are going to do the next one in six because now we are good at it
right
it took
thirteen
yeah it was ah named o x
it was named o x hoping ah that you would at least get it in within the single within the odds the single
i i thought we would get yeah i thought we'd get the six seven or eight the confidence of youth
yeah that's right well the point is that this was sort of like a statement um system effect that is <unk> you how to do and so we're going to do it much better
and you got more ambitious and furthermore there is this tendency because its a ten year cycle
old age doesn't matter
just before you're about to ship somebody has a bright idea
yeah
and so we really really must
get that in
we we did that successfully with the s t o
s t o stuff that that i basically ah i think it's saves you
plus plus just beautiful
yeah and then people tried it with other things and it didn't work so well they got things in but it wasn't as as dramatic
and it took longer and longer and longer
so after c plus plus eleven which was a huge improvement and ah what basically what most people are using today
we decided ever again
and so how to avoid those slips and the answer is that you ship more often
so that if you if you if you have a slip on the ten year cycle
by the time you know it's a slip there's eleven years till you get it
um yeah
now with a three year cycle there is about three four years till you get it
like yeah
the the delay between feature freeze and ah the shipping so we always get one or two years more
and so we we shipped fourteen on time we shipped seventeen on time and we shipped we will ship twenty on time
they they don't have any and furthermore this allows this gives a <unk> that allows the <unk> the compiler <unk> the library <unk>
to they have a target and they deliver on it eleven took two years for ah most <unk> who good enough fourteen
most <unk> actually getting pretty good in fourteen seventeen everybody ship in seventeen
wow
we are going to have
at least almost everybody ship almost everything in twenty and i know this because they're shipping in nineteen
predictably this is good delivery on time is good and so yeah
that's great so
it's how it works
okay i'm gonna i'm gonna <unk> our own plants
i just i just got them and not this dog brush my husband just gave me that but i figured let me just do this and show you um the reality
oh i can't show you my address so i'm gonna have to do it in a way that wait a minute this actually might be some of my clothing
this is some of my clothing this is clothing that i shipped back from when i was in florida so that's not a plant but this is a plant this is a plant
so i don't i don't use scissors i use my <unk> and maybe it's <unk> for you but that's how i open up tape and i just kind of rip it open like that
you know i still get excited opening up plants even though i ship a lot of plants oh oh i'm excited
like i need more plants i do need more plants i was just thinking to myself i need quite a few more plants because when i wasn't here it wasn't here for quite a long time during the pandemic i was in florida and i really couldn't come back home
so it was really difficult time but at the same time i gave a lot of my plants to friends and family because it wasn't fair that my husband was taking care of them
so i got rid of them and now i regret it so i have see this is these are four plants in one box and i'm gonna show you what we have
because i'm excited i kind of know what they are but they will ship to me because i need to have them here because i need plants i need plants
i need more plants um you can cut the string if you want but i like to not cut the string because i like to use it
so i just gently release
the
cord edge
and then do that
and so i just want to reuse these sleeves too so i try to be as careful as i can and pull it from the bottom like this
let's see okay come on come on you can do this don't rip it and i use my hand and i just oh this is a <unk> fern
it's little it's cute and i have some wrap around it that keeps the soil down
for now we're trying to work on having just all natural materials and we're getting to that point but you can recycle that and then you just take the paper away
yeah shredded paper because it really helps keep the soil down and this came this showed up pretty nicely ah look at that it's just a couple of little leaves a couple of leaves didn't do so well
but the soil is nice and moist it still looks pretty good there's just one one little stem that didn't make it that happens sometimes when you get plants in the mail
but look at that i cleaned it up a little bit to show you the <unk> fern it traveled pretty well i'm pretty excited about that
and i'm dirty i'm dirty ah by the way i'm wearing <unk> bottoms
i actually i was wearing a skirt today i don't know what came over me decided i wanted to dress up for whatever reason just because when you don't have to dress up
sometimes you just wanna do it if you feel like you're maybe you're gonna go someplace kind of exciting i don't know or you're ready to go and someone said hey we've got a very exciting place to go to although it's not really happening right now
it's just seeing <unk> get off me
i love <unk> i have i have to transplant one i have this one this is a moon a moonlight this one i've had forever i had to transplant it but that's why it's on the table
i'll put things on the table that i know i need to do stuff with so you know that's why it's on the table so here's the moonlight i'm just gonna leave that on here for now it's not a moonlight this is a <unk>
and and we put the bamboo in there so it's just if the box accidentally gets turned over the plant doesn't <unk> on itself
here we go it's a <unk> and
so cute
i'm kind of into ferns lately i don't know about you because i like a bit of a challenge ferns are a little bit challenging so most i have a blue star fern someplace i think behind me that is doing really really well
i had fern rabbit rabbit ferns that i don't have anymore and i've got some other ferns and i'm just i'm doing um an <unk>
it's cold out i know i know i'll be done in a minute okay um
these are a little bit easier to care for than the <unk> ferns
the <unk> ferns do not like to dry out they really really don't the button ferns can handle a little bit better remember to recycle this is a recycle pile
reuse it too if you want you can get creative and then remember to remove remove the paper the paper should not stay here
i'm just making little piles of
sorry
i can't take the dirt the <unk> everywhere
so there's a button fern
button fern and <unk> fern and was there anything else in the box those were three there are three plants in that box and i've got one i don't think it's my clothing i think it's a plant
so
you know sometimes they don't shut the box doesn't show up in such a pretty condition and so just let us know about that and then we have
oh boy oh boy i think i know what this is this is a type of prayer plant
and i'm gonna show you in a second again i really like to keep the plant sleeve in one piece
and this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> and this one was flowering and it's still flowering a little bit
i'm sure if you can see it but the flowers are kind of fading but this is pretty it's pretty dry it needs to be watered you can see the foliage is a little floppy a little bit
that's kind of normal there's you're gonna have that's gonna happen it's a plant there's soil it's almost impossible to not have the soil come out
so we try really really really hard to keep the soil in the pot but you can always put this oil back in the pot if you find that it's at the bottom of the box so we have a flowering <unk> <unk>
and we do have a
um but just
really meant to keep the soil down you see that
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
now i got
here you here you go you stay over there for now i'm gonna water you after this and i think i have one more i have one more and this box got look i'm gonna show you
oh this might be my clothing i don't know what this is
not good not good postal people not good i don't know what's in here but i'm gonna let you know in a second and what kind of shape it's in
oh boy oh boy there's a lot of plants in here
i don't really enjoy this i don't like seeing a <unk> box like that it really <unk> me and i wonder who did that to that box how did it get in that shape
did they throw it off of the truck did they pack too many pots and pot boxes on top of it maybe i think i should put cameras in all the boxes so we can actually see what happens
not gonna happen it's a little too expensive to do that
but here we have an <unk> <unk> it's a <unk> <unk>
and see the pot got <unk> a little bit they have yeah
i don't know what to say about that but doesn't make me happy but the <unk> still in good shape so you could probably
eventually work out work out the <unk> in the pot or put it in a cover pot and it'll just fill out i don't know but yes this is this is the the <unk> <unk> that's pretty good this is a little bit of leaf damage on that one but i'll just cut that off
and but it's in really good shape
it's such a pretty plant the deep i love the deep maroon on the back sides of the leaf they're so pretty there's a new leaf the new leaf is light green okay where are gonna go where are you gonna go
i just put this big table here and now i'm running out of space
that's that
we have here we have it's the it's an <unk> it's not a flowering <unk>
doesn't really flower
and it doesn't it's not for the flower i'm not here for the flowers if you know what i mean
i'm here for the green the green and the maroon and the light green and the ah oh so it's an <unk> <unk>
which is this is a six inch container and
these do really really well it looks like a cup it's a plant cup don't drink out of it okay do not drink out of it looks great your beauty how pretty i know i'm moving so fast
how pretty deep eyes deep dark eyes i love that
and then we have a few more <unk> we have a few more <unk>
i can't get enough of <unk>
you know why
because i can't kill them i actually that's not true i killed one i killed a very large <unk> because i think it had nearly bugs and i think i forgot to take care of it
you're so gorgeous you are i love you and this is a magenta it's a <unk> <unk> magenta
this is like trees it's like trees perfect trees
and then the last but not least
okay maybe at least okay i'm sorry i'm such a mean person sometimes and um judging plants shouldn't do that should never judge your plants
they might be judging us and you don't know about it they say are you really actually wearing that out don't do it
and this is a <unk> <unk>
green green
is this green my wrong
<unk> <unk> magenta <unk> green i think it's just called green i forgot i don't i can't i just can't i can't remember i can't remember all you all your names
imagine having so many kids you don't know what their names are anymore you just number them anyways that's my <unk> and everybody everybody showed up okay um i'll just make sure these are not plants i'm pretty sure that
yeah these are clothes these are clothes ah these are clothes i left back in florida you don't wanna see my clothes
smell i think they're stinky they're really <unk>
oh other stuff it's other stuff anyway that's it that's my <unk> i did make a mess
i'm constantly cleaning up the plant studio i clean it up and i do something and then i have to clean it up again so guess what i'm doing after this cleaning it up
anyway i just thought i'd make a quick a quick little video ah it's cause it's tuesday i think it's tuesday because it's tuesday
anyway see you guys soon i hope you're well um yeah i'm just that's it a quick <unk>
bye
hello everyone you're watching the channel military tv
today we'll show you twenty five of the most badass military vehicles in use by the u s armed forces
number one m one one seven guardian
when forces need something more <unk> than <unk> but still require significant mobility the m one one seven guardian goes into action
this fifteen ton vehicle runs on a <unk> diesel engine
two hundred and sixty horse power eight hundred and <unk> pound feed of <unk> and reaches a top speed of <unk> miles per hour
to keep enemies at bay the guardian <unk> two types of machine guns and an automatic grenade launcher
<unk> marine and land systems produces this model
number two <unk> combat vehicle
the <unk> vehicle serves to transport troops to the scene of a battle and provide cover while they prepare to fight
it runs on eight wheels and can beat off machine gun fire without issue
to approve the usefulness of <unk> the military began upgrading the vehicle with cannons and anti tank guided missiles in two thousand and sixteen
in its most potent form enemy tanks have a hard time overpowering it
number three m one <unk>
using the chassis of the <unk> m one tank the u s marine corps and army found a replacement for the m one <unk>
in this m one <unk> assault <unk>
while the tank is an offensive weapon the <unk> serves as a utility model
clearing space by <unk> anything in its path
though it does have a machine gun and smoke <unk> on board the <unk> is more of a badass support vehicle
it hits a maximum of fifteen hundred of horse power and can reach a top speed of <unk> miles per hour
number four m two bradley fighting vehicle
there are several versions of b a ease bradley fighting vehicle b f v
but the one design for combat missions features a twenty five <unk> push master cannon and armour crushing missiles on board
this model transports up to ten soldiers at a time and features a six hundred horse power engine
top speed is thirty five miles per hour
the b f v weighs nearly seventy one thousand pounds and holds a hundred and <unk> gallons of fuel in its tank
number five a a v seven <unk> assault vehicle
marine operations take the corp on land and by sea
and the a a v seven is the assault vehicle that can handle both
capable of handling a crew of three along with twenty five marines
this vehicle can travel up to twenty nautical miles at sea and three hundred miles on land
a twenty five <unk> <unk> machine gun forty <unk> grenade launcher and m q h b fifty <unk> machine gun provide cover
on pave roads it can even reach a top speed of forty five miles per hour
number six m one zero nine a seven tank
the u s army <unk> brigade combat team a b c t leaned on the m one zero nine a six <unk> <unk> <unk>
for decades of support in artillery missions
<unk> systems producer of this tank began upgrading the m one zero nine a six for greater combat capability in two thousand fourteen
the resulting m one zero nine a seven builds upon the profile of this <unk> of overseas
with a new chassis and upgraded digital sweep
number seven avenger weapon system
when the army needs to handle air defense on the move the avenger is the <unk> weapon
it carries eight <unk> missiles capable of shooting down helicopters or low flying aircraft as necessary
its ability to track and shoot while in motion is one of its greatest assets
boeing produced this mobile weapon system for the army until late in the past decade
and began supplying the egyptian army with models in two thousand eight
number eight buffalo clearance vehicle
the buffalo mine protected root clearance vehicle m p c v helps forces establish command in especially dangerous areas
the heavily armored truck runs on six wheels weighs seventy six thousand pounds and measures twenty seven feet in length
it packs a caterpillar c thirteen engine capable of one thousand four hundred and eighty three pound feet of <unk>
allowing it to reach a maximum speed of fifty five miles per hour
its thirty foot robotic arm complete with camera and sensory devices manages route clearance while its v shaped hole keeps the impact of mine explosions
to a minimum
number nine global <unk>
it takes a serious <unk> to throw a tank on its bed for transport across the desert
enter the <unk> global heavy equipment <unk> <unk> this six by six vehicle runs on a caterpillar c eighteen engine
capable of seven hundred horse power and supports a pay load capacity of seventy two tonnes sixty five thousand three hundred and seventeen kilograms
when a unit needs to deploy a tank with short driving range
the global <unk> <unk> into the battle scene
americans may have gotten sick of that guy who drives a <unk> long ago but this vehicle remains a badass machine when properly <unk> for a battle
first used during the nineteen <unk> invasion of panama the high mobility multi purpose wheeled vehicle used the six point five liter diesel engine with four wheel drive
the protected gun turn featured on newer models first appeared during the wars in afghanistan and iraq
number eleven <unk> t v assault
among small to mid sized vehicles supporting offensive and defensive operations <unk> <unk> t v assault features a higher level of protection
and <unk> in attack mode
this model carries up to eleven crew members and uses an independent suspension system that manages the majority of its routes in off road environments
when it's time to fight the m a t v assault can implement a weapons platform featuring <unk> missiles
and a m two four nine five point five six <unk> machine gun
number twelve m one a two abrams main battle tank
tank development production moves rather slowly which explains the long life of the m one a one abrams model originally deployed in nineteen eighty
the newer m one a two abrams main battle tank runs on the same frame but features depleted uranium armor for enhanced production
as well as a new commander's weapon station with greater tech applications
the tank runs on a honey well fifteen hundred a g t gas turbine fifteen hundred horse power

everyone laughed at google's little self-driving car when the tech company begin testing autonomous vehicle technology
meanwhile <unk> has been developing its own unmanned driving system for military vehicle use
the technology integrates with heavy duty vehicles for situation when sending no driver is the best policy
terra max is an after market upgrade
number twenty three <unk> m m r s <unk>
if you've ever wondered how armed forces retrieve damaged vehicles from the battlefield the multi mission recovery system <unk> provides the answer
this ten wheel drive beast supports up fifty ton rotating boom that extends over forty feet
the m m r s can pick up just about any vehicle within that length and move it where it needs to go
number twenty four black knight <unk>
though the black night <unk> is not yet in operation we felt obligated to include the vehicle known as the flying <unk>
prototypes boast the ability to reach a maximum speed of seventy miles per hour on land and fly as high as ten thousand feet
advanced tactics which debuted this concept in two thousand twelve <unk> it as the alternate tool for cargo <unk> missions
but this <unk> does more than drive and fly
the bottom can accommodate a boat haul in place of the drive train
number twenty five <unk> q <unk> one engineer
the <unk> <unk> one engineer may not look like much but its ability to take out i e ds in autonomous mode gives a potential for future military use
at its base <unk> one is a four wheel drive <unk> m v r s seven hundred that controllers can operate nearly one thousand yards away
with its clearance tools the engineer also provides support for command and evacuation operations
the rollers in front and back are built for mine duty
this time is the most crucial it's been the entire year
in the spring it was not that bad here
we had covid cases but it wasn't like you saw pictures of new york
today we have a hundred and forty covid patients in a two hundred and thirteen bed hospital i think it's only going to get worse before it gets better
um she has problem with breathing ah she's not eating
you know her medical problem at all
ah she has diabetes severe diabetes and ah high blood pressure
rosa how many days have you been feeling this way
she is doing better already okay from when she came in here
okay you're okay take a deep breath okay we're gonna do everything we can that's what i can promise you okay
okay
alright rosa i'm gonna put this one on okay
so that's a constant battle we're doing that all day long twenty-four hours a day i think if you didn't take it seriously before now is the time to take it seriously
code blue i c u north at eighteen code blue i c u north at eighteen code blue i c u north at eighteen
we had this built on friday in anticipation of the surge continuing to peak which on sunday it got there
our i c u is overwhelmed with patients so we're gonna double bunk them in here
okay
normally these patients would be in the <unk> upstairs but all of those beds are full we created an additional ten beds outside of <unk> those are all full
we have six more patients holding in the operating room and then we can hold up to twenty-four more patients in this area
it is completely full right now as soon as one goes out another one comes in they are all covid positive every single one of them
so one two
i need two now
<unk> okay
i need three more <unk> then right
everyone's getting sick with covid at the same time so our staff are calling out faster than we can get staff in
we've received a couple ah traveler nurses from the state of california recently which is wonderful ah but the hard part is is that everyone's fighting for the same resources at the same time
all of the hospitals in california are struggling
we have ah the medications we need that the f d a has approved we have <unk> plasma for patients
we have all the things that we didn't have previously but patients still it is effective but these patients are just sicker it's i don't even know how to explain it um it seems that once we get folks on a ventilator it's really hard to get them off
where's the <unk> straight over this way
just keep it up
he's a person happens to be a neighbor of mine we had family friends here we've had people that i've known some people succeed and some people you know
unfortunately covid is a tragic tragic process so
i've seen ah approximately ten people that i that i know or that are family friends or neighbors three three unfortunately have passed
so ah three it's it's it's tough it's tough seeing all that
there's a lot of weight on the shoulders that we all carry it's it's depressing but we're all hopeful that's the thing i think that we all cling onto hope
i'm a religious man so i pray while i can go home to my family and i look at them and that's what brings me happiness that's what gets me out of my little depression
i am very tired today i don't even know what day um in a row we've been working
ah i've been working twelve fifteen hours everyday as we all have been we're here on weekends we're here on nights
ah we're watching over each other but you know we're pouring our hearts out to the patients and staff um it's hard i'm tired
yeah there's still a lot of misunderstanding potentially in the community about how it spreads how people are getting it
i don't think they realize how hard it is for the families when you see them come in here and hold the hand of their loved that's about to die
we have done a lot of work around vaccine planning but also realistically it's not gonna be available to community members right away
this is going to take months it's gonna take months for it to get better
you need to wear your mask you need to social distance you need to wash your hands
you really need to follow the science and the guidelines that are being put forward
we as healthcare workers and caregivers are doing everything we can to keep people safe to take care of them while they're here in the hospital
but if so many people come in and keep coming in like this it worries me that we're not gonna be able to keep you or any of your loved ones safe any longer
myths and rumors circulate in a very similar way to the way that microbes spread they can be contagious in that one person hears something
they pass it on to another person and another and suddenly a rumor becomes really <unk> and i think we've always had this problem
but with the internet and social media just the scale the scope and the speed of it is really <unk> up i'm doctor <unk> <unk> and i'm a doctor
a professor at stanford school of medicine and director of the stanford center for health communication and i'm going to <unk> some illness and disease myths
people kind of want to know like exactly how much water should i be drinking but there isn't that magic number
i think this myth has been circulating for a long time and somehow eight glasses of an <unk> glass specifically is what's circulated
it depends on your body size and how active you are at a given time
there is no reason to eat your <unk> i do hear from people that they want to eat their <unk>
because monkeys or other wild animals do it but the reason that those it is because they don't want to attract predators
there is no reason for a human to eat a <unk>
your heart does not skip a beat when you sneeze i think a lot of us grow up hearing things about sneezing that your eyes close
and your heart <unk> a beat and you're like a dead for a <unk> or something um yeah clearly not true
adults have fewer bones than babies and that's actually true because babies are born with some bones that fuse to become a bigger bone
there is a phenomenon known as the july effect which wonders and asks this question that if you have massive turnover
new residents starting new faculty starting around july then isn't that a more dangerous time to be in a hospital and there have been three hundred studies looking into this
and it turns out that it depends on what kind of hospital it is who you're being looked after like how experienced they are but also what kind of illness you are and how seriously sick you are
the take home from this is that if you're sick in july you still need to go to a hospital and by and large you're in good hands
so your body makes toxins as it <unk> different things but the thing is your body also <unk> those things out
you don't need to be doing anything or taking anything to cleanse yourself flat tummy tea is most of them are not good for you
they kind of go under this umbrella of oh well it's natural or it's <unk> but those herbs are no joke sometimes flat tummy teas contain <unk>
which yes it's a herb but it's also a <unk> so if you wanna crap the weight out i mean all you're doing is emptying your bowels and becoming <unk>
your body does have waste products in it that's why you pee and that's why you poop and even when you breathe you are exhaling carbon dioxide which is a waste product
but your body is perfectly primed to do that to get rid of what you don't need people do ask about <unk> you do not need them
you do not need to put coffee up your butt you don't need to be shoving liquids up there to get anything out unless of course you have <unk> and the doctor <unk> an <unk> but if you're healthy and functioning fine then you don't need to do a <unk>
people are making billions of dollars off dietary supplements that many of us don't need and that includes vitamins
if you are eating a <unk> diet you're getting the vitamins that you need and you don't need to be popping a pill to stay healthy
you need to take a vitamin if your healthcare provider tells you you have a deficiency and you need to top up and take a pill or take a liquid that <unk> your level of that vitamin
m s g is not addictive it's not unsafe and the thing that i was fascinated with when i was writing this was that those myths that you've heard about m s g
that is addictive that it's really bad for you are all tied to racism and the fact that it was chinese people owning chinese restaurants that were using it and that's how it got labeled as something that was dirty and toxic
in moderation it's no worse for you than regular salt
people have asked me if genetically modified food is safe whether they should pay more for non g m o food pay more for organic food but g m o food is safe
and the definition of organic honestly can be so broad and vague and different from one place to another that most doctors will say
just eat a healthy balanced varied diet and you don't necessarily need to pay more for organic for most foods
i do get asked about artificial <unk> a lot because a lot of my friends like to <unk> diet <unk> the thing to bear in mind here is that some of the studies are not that robust
so you might have seen headlines saying diet <unk> cause alzheimer's disease or diet soda causes stroke
and they're not necessarily true and the thing that i worry about then is will people ditch the diet soda and just start drinking sugary soda when we know that those are linked to diabetes and other illnesses
artificial <unk> the kind that you find in diet <unk> do not cause alzheimer's disease
stroke and cancer you may have seen headlines that say that but i think that they are <unk> what the scientific studies are really showing
there have been studies showing some harmful effects of artificial <unk> in rats
but then you have to take that with a large grain of salt to say that well just because it did something in a <unk> body will that translate into happening in a <unk> body
but if you wanna be really careful you can just drink water
the great message
you are a little bit taller first thing in the morning probably no more than a centimeter though and that's just because gravity <unk> your joints during the course of the day
it's also why when astronauts come back to earth after a space mission they are a little bit taller than when they left earth
there are studies showing that bad teeth especially bad <unk> can lead to heart disease and make you more susceptible and that's because of the bacteria
that causes gum disease can circulate through the blood and cause illness elsewhere it's certainly something that makes us look at the patient <unk>
so it's important to get your blood pressure checked and it's important to eat well but it's also really important to get good dental hygiene and get routine <unk> to make sure your <unk> are as healthy as everything else
there are some studies that are quite exciting that show that <unk> which we already recommend for a number of things might lower the risk of cancer
but there's still more research being done and there aren't a ton of medical organizations saying hey everyone should take an <unk> pill everyday to prevent cancer
what we're learning is that it's certain types of cancer in particular and that there might be something about <unk> that prevents metastatic cancer that prevents cancer cells from moving around the body
but even in that case it might be that the <unk> works for that only in some people and not in everyone
i get so many questions about <unk> because it feels like every year we discover a new use for it it is an incredible incredible drug
but the <unk> still out on <unk> preventing cancer
please do not stop taking an antibiotic the moment you feel better if you still have more to complete the course it's really important that if you have ten days of pills
but you feel better on day four or day three even you still have to finish that course of antibiotics so that the bug does not become resistant to the medicine
antibiotics cannot help with a cold most <unk> most sore throats are caused by viruses and antibiotics will not do anything to those
antibiotics fight bacteria very specifically so if you have a virus circulating in your blood taking an antibiotic will not help
it's been circulating for ages that you should starve a fever and feed a cold you just need to eat well and stay <unk> when you're not well
it it is dangerous to starve yourself like that's a thing that we know that's proven so if you have a fever stay <unk> and eat well
the flu shot can definitely not cause the flu the flu shot might make you <unk> but for the vast majority of us getting the flu shot is a fantastic idea
you will not get the flu from it and it will keep you safe
i think we all grew up hearing that you should never go outside in the cold when your hair is wet or like make sure you bundle up and our mothers loved doing that to us
during cold times is when there are more cold bugs circulating anyway and also there is some research that shows that cold weather might impact the immune system
but i don't know if it's that robust i think it's still a good idea though to wrap up very warm
you do not lose more heat from your head than anywhere else on your body
you can tell a little bit about what's making somebody sick from looking at the color of their <unk> which is the um disgusting thing that you cough up
for example if it's very clear that's less likely to be an infection usually if it's green or yellow more likely to be a bacterial or viral infection
i think doctors are good at assessing the color of <unk> that people are coughing up out of their lungs if you are emptying your nose into a tissue
probably looking at the color to try and figure out exactly what bacteria is causing it that's not gonna be something you can assess
people wonder if their ears stop growing when the rest of them stops growing and actually your ears carry on growing forever
so the current guidelines in the u s about men who have sex with men can only donate blood if they've been <unk> for twelve months which is ludicrous and stupid and unscientific
it wasn't until two thousand and fifteen thirty years after we had a test for h i v aids
that gay men and bisexual men were told yes you can donate blood but there was a major caveat
and that caveat was that men who have sex with men could only donate blood if they had been <unk> for twelve months
vaccines do not cause autism i may get that tattooed on my face at some point in <unk> i'm kind of being sarcastic here
but if a patient was to ask me that i would take their concerns really seriously and not be dismissive cause i wanna know why they think that and i wanna make sure that i reassure them
that vaccines are safe and what they cause is a long life and good health
the best way to <unk> your hands is to wash them very well with water and soap and then to rub them clean
hand <unk> good if you're in a bind but is nowhere near as good as washing your hands with soap and water i get asked a lot of questions about alcohol gel
hand sanitizer and like <unk> wipes and they are really useful they do <unk> surfaces
but nothing is equivalent to <unk> your hands as washing them with soap and water
it's true that many patients cared for by a female doctor have better health outcomes there've been a number of studies that show that patients do better
they live longer they're less likely to be <unk> to the hospital if they're cared for by a doctor who is a woman
and at the same time women doctors face lots of discrimination and get paid less than our male counterparts
it's hard to avoid misinformation sometimes there is so much false health news circulating
and sometimes you can just feel overwhelmed even with the correct information i think the important thing to do is to talk to a healthcare provider that you feel like you can trust
who has an open mind and someone that gives you the time and space to talk about what's really concerning you
cells are the smallest living units of an organism
all cells have three things in common no matter what type of cell they are
all cells have a cell membrane which separates the inside the cell from its environment
<unk> which is a jelly like fluid and d n a which is the <unk> genetic material
there are two broad categories of cells
the first category is <unk> cells they have <unk> which include the nucleus and other special parts
<unk> cells are more advanced complex cells such as those found in plants and animals
the second category is <unk> cells
they don't have a nucleus or membrane enclosed <unk>
they do have genetic material but it's not contained within a nucleus
<unk> cells are always one <unk> or <unk> organisms such as bacteria
so what are <unk>
<unk> means little organ
<unk> are the specialized parts of a cell that have unique jobs to perform
let's start with the nucleus the control center of the cell
the nucleus contains d n a or genetic material
d n a dictates what the cell is going to do and how it's going to do it
<unk> the tangled spread out form of d n a found inside the nuclear membrane
when a cell is ready to divide d n a <unk> into structures known as chromosomes
the nucleus also contains a <unk>
which is a structure where <unk> are made
after <unk> leave the nucleus they will have the important job of <unk> or making proteins
outside the nucleus the <unk> and the rest of the <unk> float around in <unk> which is the <unk> substance
<unk> may wander freely within the <unk>
or attach to the <unk> <unk> sometimes abbreviated as e r
there are two types of e r rough e r has <unk> attached to it
and smooth e r doesn't have <unk> attached to it
the <unk> <unk> is a membrane enclosed passageway for transporting materials such as the proteins <unk> by <unk>
proteins and other materials emerge from the <unk> <unk> in small <unk>
where the <unk> apparatus sometimes called the <unk> body receives them
as proteins move through the <unk> body they're customized into forms that the cell can use
the <unk> body does this by folding the proteins into usable shapes
or adding other materials on to them such as <unk>
or carbohydrates
<unk> are sac like structures that store different materials
here in this plant cell the central <unk> stores water
going back to the animal cell you'll see an <unk> called a <unk>
<unk> are the garbage collectors that take in damaged or worn out cell parts
they are filled with enzymes that break down this cellular debris
the <unk> in is an <unk> that is the powerhouse for both animal and plant cells
during a process called cellular <unk> the mitochondria make a t p molecules that provide the energy for all the cells activities
cells that need more energy have more mitochondria
meanwhile the cell maintains its shape through a <unk>
the <unk> includes the <unk> <unk> which are made of protein
and <unk> which are thin hollow tubes
some organisms such as plans that are <unk>
meaning they capture sunlight for energy
have cells with an <unk> called a <unk>
the <unk> is where photosynthesis happens
it's green because it has a green pigment called <unk>
plant cells also have a cell wall outside of their cell <unk> that shape support and protect the plant cell
animal cells never have a cell wall
there are many other unique structures that only some cells have
here are just a few in humans for example the respiratory tract is lined with cells that have <unk>
these are microscopic hair like projections that can move in waves
this feature helps trap <unk> particles in the air and <unk> them when you cough
another unique feature in some cells is <unk> some bacteria have <unk>
a <unk> is like a little tail that can help a cell move or propel itself
the only human cell that has a <unk> is a sperm cell
in summary remember
<unk> cells are plant and animal cells with a nucleus and membrane enclosed <unk>
while <unk> cells are <unk> organisms without these things
all cells have a cell membrane <unk> and genetic material
and even though only plant cells have <unk> both plant and animal cells have mitochondria
coffee did you know that over four hundred billion cups of coffee are consumed every year
coffee also know around my house as liquid gold is the second most traded commodity in the world only behind oil in today's video i'm gonna show you why coffee is not bad for you
and the nine scientific benefits to having a daily cup of joe
i will also finish with some short f a <unk> about the best time to drink coffee how much per day is okay and how much is too much
when people say coffee is bad for you they often point to a few things insomnia <unk> and <unk> fatigue
insomnia is usually just a result of drinking coffee too early since effects can last up to ten hours after drinking simply stop drinking coffee before noon and you should be fine
<unk> yes coffee is a natural <unk> but this problem is cured by drinking more water which you should be doing anyway
and <unk> fatigue this is not even a real medical condition anyone <unk> this sort of nonsense doesn't deserve your time or attention
here are the proven benefits of drinking coffee backed by scientific studies number one coffee can help you burn fat
caffeine has been shown to boost metabolism by up to eleven percent and dramatically increase fat burning potential
other studies have even shown that the rate of fat being burned while drinking caffeine can improve by ten percent in obese individuals and <unk> percent in lean individuals
number two coffee helps you exercise better caffeine has been proven to be one of the most effective supplements even for improving exercise output
drinking coffee causes a spike in adrenaline and causes an increase in exercise performance by around eleven to twelve percent number three your heart seems to like it
drinking up to two coffee cups per day can reduce the risk of heart failure by up to eleven percent number four coffee can make you smarter
it enhances the firing of neurons in the brain and has been shown to improve various brain functions including mood energy levels reaction time memory and general cognitive function
number five coffee contains an incredible amount of <unk> these <unk> help fight free radicals in the body
and scientists have identified approximately a thousand different <unk> in the coffee bean alone number six coffee drinkers have a lower risk of developing cancer
astonishingly coffee has been shown to lower the chances of getting liver cancer by up to forty percent
also a study with over four hundred thousand members showed that people who consume coffee had a lower risk of <unk> cancer by fifteen percent
number seven coffee contains essential nutrients the body loves and needs one cup of coffee contains nutrients like <unk> potassium magnesium and others
while the volume of the nutrients it contains is not going to blow you away
if you drink three cups per day like the like the average american adult you'll be getting a steady source of vital nutrients that your body loves
number eight coffee can fight depression most people are unaware of the fact the over seventeen point five million people just in america alone suffer from some form of depression
and it's growing every year drinking coffee has been shown to lower the risk of developing depression by up to twenty percent for women
it has also been shown that those who drink up to four cups per day are <unk> percent less likely to commit suicide than those who do not
number nine coffee drinkers have a lower risk of developing certain diseases type two diabetes now effects over three hundred million people worldwide and is becoming a global problem
heavy coffee drinkers however have a twenty-three percent to <unk> percent reduction and risk of developing the disease
also drinking coffee results in a thirty-two percent to sixty percent reduction and risk for developing parkinson's as well
these overall studies show that coffee is good for your heart brain and your body the best time of the day to drink coffee is around one hour after waking up or thirty minutes before your workout
use a drip coffee maker if possible other popular machines use plastic cups that are <unk> and are very damaging to our planet
how much per day is okay a short rule of thumb is two cups a day is fine three cups a day is good and four cups a day should be the absolute max
finally drink your coffee black most of the specialty drinks at coffee shops are calorie nightmares and are basically glorified <unk>
drinking it black takes some time to get used to but just like an acquired taste to wine and it gets better with time

for we are currently building out some incredible resources to help you take your health to the next level cheers
you use the pouring technique to create a lovely pattern on the surface of the drink
and i'm not even gonna give you guys a chance to get a picture of this because it doesn't match our standards so ah
hello my name is michael phillips i'm the two thousand and ten world <unk> champion and the director of education for blue bottle coffee internationally
and today we're gonna talk about how to make a <unk>
now for <unk> you've got some core ingredients we've got some wonderful coffee today we're using the hayes valley <unk>
you have delicious ice cold milk you've got of course water being pumped into your equipment and you'll have all the tools you need to make that same delicious drink that we make for you in our shops
one of the defining characteristics of a <unk> is that it's about a five to six ounce beverage so it's usually nice and proper that keeps the ratio nice and tight
so the very first step
is we wanna make sure that our cups nice and hot
you can add a little water off the machine here this is gonna keep it at a high temperature
so that it maintains all the heat and we don't have to take our milk to such a high temperature ah which let us keep a little bit more of the sweetness out of it
the next step we want to get our pop ready so this is referred to as a porter filter you got the basket right here
this is where you are going to put your coffee that if ground and are preparing to extract
ah you wanna make sure it's nice and clean and dry which is what we use our porter filter towel for
and we're really precise about this so we actually use digital scales to measure the weight to make sure we're super specific on it down to the tenth of a gram
got a grinder here i'm gonna run just a little bit through to make sure everything we're getting is nice and fresh
so our grinder is gonna dose a timed out version of coffee in here
but it's probably not as precise as we want so we double check so right now i'm at nineteen point five want to add a little bit more
and here we go now i'm at <unk> so i have to use this process this next step is called <unk>
and that's where we shift the coffee grounds around the top of the basket to try and get a nice and even surface
so the next step you want to compress this bed of coffee down just a little bit
ah to do that we use this right here this is a <unk>
it's like a <unk> knife everybody has one that fits your hand just right
you want to make sure your porter filter is nice and level you want a line coming straight up from that through your elbow
and then you compact it
nice and evenly
the most important parts is you wanna make sure it's nice and level
because that's gonna affect how fast the water goes through the various parts of the <unk>
so now that we have the porter filter <unk> we are ready to lock it in and start pulling your shots
so we want to get the water out of that cup
again we've got another scale up here
ah the three big variables that we pay attention to is the dose so the amount of coffee the yield the amount of stress are going into the cup
and the time that it takes i've got a little timer right here
so ah flush a little water through the group head
lock it in nice and tight and then we're going to pull that shot
now for the hayes valley um this is a very very tight extraction right
twenty grams of coffee in for twenty grams of coffee out that's what we would refer to as a reasonably short shot
ah but we must slow that extraction process down so we're aiming for about thirty to thirty-five seconds over all time to get it to taste just right
now the time it takes for that to happen is what's really gonna to affect the flavor
ah low twenty second shot is gonna be a very sour <unk> shot
ah for the haze we tend to like something between thirty and thirty-five seconds to get that nice <unk> really clean flavor
if you go a little bit longer than that say forty seconds or even higher than that the shots can start to taste excessively bitter
<unk> seconds right in the pocket
so as you can see that is a really nice lovely shot that we have there
so now that we've got a <unk> shot that falls into the parameters just the way we want we're gonna steam up some milk and finish up this <unk>
now when you're steaming you want to take this steam on tip that has a few little holes in it that hot air jets out through
and you want to have it right at the surface of the milk in your pitcher because that's gonna let it whip in the air to create the texture that you're looking for
once you've added the desired amount of texture you're gonna lift that pitcher up ah so that's not whipping in anymore air but it's still bringing that temperature up right into the zone that you want
steaming is gonna be really quick and it's gonna take about five to six seconds on this on this machine
whole machines may take a little bit longer but overall this is one of those experiences where most people you know you blink and it's done you wonder what happened do we have it adjusted right there i've got that tip at the surface
and turn that on
you hear that air whipping in you don't want to do too much
and then
that quick you want to make sure you wipe off your steam wand give it a little purge at the end
you're gonna give my <unk> one more little swirl a really great thing to do after you steamed your milk
tap it
on the counter
and give it a nice swirl we call that polishing
that's gonna take what was a <unk> texture and give it a nice shine so it's got that that white gold like <unk> milk
and then you can combine the two with <unk> art
ah there's a lot to be said about this and it takes some <unk> a lifetime to learn really well
so i'm not gonna try and describe it to you too much i'm just going to show it to you and act like it's a mystic talent that only professionals can develop
after years of practice
and that right there is a finished <unk>
um
um
we're going to explore the concept of charitable giving to see the ways in which you can help make an impact we're also taking advantage of some of the financial and tax benefits
charitable giving doesn't have to be complicated
it can be as simple as making donations to your church alma mater or volunteering your time like helping out at the local mission
giving is most fulfilling when you donate your money or time to a cause you're passionate about
and studies have shown that when we give it triggers the same chemical reactions in our brains is falling in love or bonding with a newborn child
besides the obvious emotional benefits you could also end up saving on taxes by giving
now that you have your mission it's time to think about what goals you want to accomplish
once you have some in mind put together an action plan on paper that's focused on the different steps you'll take to create an impact
some things you can include in your plan to help your giving have more of an impact would be to volunteer not just money but skills you may have
it can also help to commit to a consistent donation over time and to focus on the less glamorous but essential needs the charity may have
there are over one point eight million nonprofits in the united states so you'll have a lot of choices
make sure to evaluate the organizations that share your cause to make sure they have strong leadership procedures that will guide their operations and will benefit from your assistance
giving can be more fun and more effective by connecting with others who share your goals
getting family and friends involved helps to also reinforce shared values and create stronger connections
besides benefiting the organizations of your choice your charitable giving can also impact your finances
it's important to discuss your mission with your financial adviser to understand the role of charitable giving can play in tax planning

mister chief justice ladies and gentlemen we are gathered here today for a ceremony in which we will have sworn in the first head of a new agency i think we have here the best man for this new job that we could find
and there was a necessity ah for the government at the time to show that it was serious about dealing with pollution problems
that the federal government was willing to step in where obviously the almost total delegation of the states and local governments ah prior to nineteen seventy ah hadn't gotten the job done
i came in in mid nineteen <unk> it was the oil embargo the arab oil embargo and energy was was it
um during my entire time it was the environmental energy
conflict if you will in in terms of policy now within the administration in the congress that was pretty crucial and i think the major e p a accomplishment of those years was to keep our programs on track
in the area of health and safety you have to have regulations and it's important that it be sensible and well managed the legislative job in terms of putting basic authority on the books is done what we now need is the science the information and the follow through
if you will to get the job done
the mission for which the agency was established is the protection of the health the welfare and the environment of the american people that is our priority is it is a ah mission to which we are dedicated to which the president is dedicated
but one that stands out to me was ah concluding the ah montreal protocol ah as a treaty that dealt with a extraordinarily significant environmental issue
but also a treaty that i think established a framework for dealing with ah international ah environmental concerns
the clean air act obviously has to ah stand very high on the list of things that ah i think we will ah be proud of and will stand the test of time it was a time when we
dealt with very high expectations when we crafted a law a lot of the ideas had been in the agency were conceptually developed in the agency they were successfully ah integrated with the the views of other agencies and coordinated very closely with the white house
who better than your government to protect your air your water and your land it is something that every american should expect of its government that we would do these things
for you setting tough standards setting standards that protect the people most at risk and then allowing for flexibility in how those standards are met which will allow us to build on the innovation and the creativity that exists in this country
what we do the methods we discover the solutions we come up with will be prototypes for others
we will look for ways to work with agriculture and business to find out how we can reach our shared goals of a clean environment in ways that will allow them to continue to supply us with what we need to enjoy our quality of life
the job is never done we have to get even better at it
and that's mean that's made been made even more evident by the fact that we now live in a global economy where our country is competing with nations that aren't nearly as environmentally conscious as we have become
our country has made great strides in cleaning our air water and land in a way that allows our nation to continue to grow and prosper
by expanding the roles of technology collaborative partnerships and flexible policies we will be able to engage broad interests and deliver results quicker and more effectively than ever before to provide the next generation
a cleaner safer environment in which to live work and play
we begin by <unk> the core values of this agency and its mission and we've shown the american people that the devotion to science to transparency and the law are paramount in protecting human health and environment
while the world continues to change e p a's mission continue to endorse our mission is to protect public health and to save god the precious natural resources that we all need to survive and to thrive
e p a is here because the american people demanded it we will be here because they continue to demand it because we stand between pollution and our people
those that we regulate ought to know what's expected of them
so that they can plan and allocate resources to comply and and the process that we're engaging and adopting regulations is very very important because it sends a message it sends a message that we take seriously
our role of taking comment and and and offering response and then making informed decisions on how it's going to impact those in the market place
since the early nineteen seventies e p a's job has been pretty straight forward clean up america and the agency has done just that
we can focus our attention and resources on helping communities help themselves
doing this will strengthen this country from its foundation up
and start to solve environmental problems of tomorrow
environmental protection is the <unk> the prerequisite for economic growth and job creation if we can solve this problem we can get many americans a much better future in the next fifty years
i'm living in a tai <unk> school in the <unk> mountains which is the heart of <unk> in china and my teacher is master <unk> who's a <unk> tai <unk> master
so sometimes in the afternoons we talk about <unk> so hence this series
<unk> is an ancient chinese philosophy and religion dating back two thousand and five hundred years to the writing of the tao te <unk> by <unk> <unk>
you can think about it as the bible for <unk> now the main thrust of <unk> is to follow the <unk> or the path or way
ah welcome to <unk> mountain the
if you observe the chinese character <unk>
the first of three strokes that's <unk> and <unk> that represents the <unk> balance
then <unk> which means oneself
that means <unk> is not far from you <unk> is within you
the last part is <unk> which means to go to move to act
this is a pretty powerful idea we don't have to rely on an external god through our own actions we can find balance
now the obvious question is great tell me what is this way but the <unk> doesn't refer to a thing instead it's the underlying order that governs the universe
so defining it as a fruitless exercise what is instead is important is to be sensitive to how the universe works and then try and live in harmony with it
that is what is meant by following the <unk> and <unk> teachings have many guidelines on how to do so
i've been reading the tai <unk> which argues the children's character <unk> the <unk> is in fact a <unk>
it's a really fun way of getting into the <unk> teachings and if you ever read <unk> the <unk> when you're younger check out the books again i did it recently it's a real nostalgia trip
in it is a nice story that illustrates what it means to be a <unk>
around a large pot of vinegar crowd three men these aren't any ordinary men in fact they're the three founders of the great asian philosophies
<unk> buddha and <unk> <unk>
each takes a taste of the vinegar and for <unk> it was sour the world was full of <unk> people and corruption and the world was out of step with the way of heaven
as a result the world was sour what was needed was rules and rituals in order to retain order
buddha then tasted the vinegar and he had a bitter expression for life was bitter because man's wants and desires led to mass suffering
and happiness could only be found in leaving this world and entering nirvana
for <unk> <unk> however he had a smile in his face for <unk> bitterness and <unk> only come from the <unk> and <unk> mind
i asked master <unk> how it could be possible <unk> <unk> could keep on smiling when tasting this horrible vinegar
human being come from nature we must follow the nature's path
nature itself there's nothing about a sour or bitter
in the nature the cosmos there is its own natural rhythm path
never to be too fast not too slow there is you know he has its reason its pace we human being also must find
finding it recognizing it and following this heavenly way
so only you depend on you own
attitude to life
as a saying goes if you froze life is like a mirror you froze the mirror froze at you you smile the mirror smiles at you that is life
the a typical <unk> is never rich yes in their sense because they are mixed with the whole universe whole universe is boundless
so that's why they are very concerned about live and wear smile
wouldn't that be awesome to be able to keep on smiling when life sometimes turns sour
that's the prospect that <unk> philosophy offers us it's a set of guidelines for living a contented and happy life
as many of you will know i started this youtube channel after finishing university i found the time quite difficult i found my my mood to be variable
and my brain was just <unk> so if you're like me and your brain is just a little bit too active or if you've had depression or anxiety or if you're like anyone and you just want to live a contented life
then my role in these videos is to see how we can apply <unk> philosophy to our own lives i don't want this to be me boring you each week i'd love this to be a two way dialogue
where you guys tell me what you think about the concepts as well as if you have any questions or issues that are personally bothering you master <unk> and i can see if <unk> philosophy can help you
if you prefer to keep that private then of course you can message me on instagram or facebook but also be awesome to start a youtube discussion as well because then you guys can help each other out
master <unk> embodies what it means to be a <unk> he's a joyous man he laughs and smiles a lot
i'm not selling clothes
despite being fifty plus he's full of energy
so i'm excited to be able to share with you some of the teachings that are in part responsible for these wonderful qualities
and the first question for this week is what your knowledge or impressions of <unk> is today do you guys know anything about it i'm also starting from almost zero so it's gonna be a learning experience for both of us
okay that's it guys thanks for watching
one thing you trying to do is say all these public companies out there here's the company i really like the fundamentals are terrific their earnings are doing well the competitors are doing poorly
i think this company is doing terrific and all of a sudden the stock might have gone from forty to thirty because of this decline that would say wow here's a chance to buy it
so you're trying to say some companies might have been <unk> at sixty and all they did was go to fifty and say big deal so you're trying to find companies you liked anyway right now you liked them and now they've had a haircut
that's what you would do is not is not just like the one from <unk> to fairly priced something was fairly placed at the start of this exercise and then had a very you know a five for sale
hey guys welcome back to the channel in this video we are going to be talking about some investing lessons that we can learn from peter lynch
that we can apply for our own investing in two thousand and twenty one
so we're gonna have a look at an interview from way back nineteen ninety seven a charlie rose interview that peter lynch did and i do have to say a apologies
some of the cuts in this interview are going to be quite abrupt it's because i don't understand like charlie rose ah he just <unk> peter all the time in this interview
so i apologize i've tried to do the best i can to get to the meat of the argument because i think the whole interview is about twenty-five minutes so i've tried to chop it down into the best bits
so with that said let's get stuck into it
glad to be here
explain to me what's going on
well we had a huge run i mean the market was four thousand just you know two and a half years ago it ran up to <unk> hundred in august
and you know like any big rally sometimes it backs off i mean it's healthy
everything is <unk>
yeah and that doesn't help any the market since world war two has sold between ten times earnings and twenty times earnings if you look at the dow jones or the s p five hundred if you add up all the companies and take the earnings
you see there's a relationship and it follows mcdonald's earnings have been terrific the last thirty years and the <unk> been direct there's a direct relationship so the earnings of the s p five hundred have been between this range of ten and twenty
we were just about to go over the twenty which is the high end of the p e range there wasn't a lot of
so the p e of twenty is too is is it the top of how high it should ever be
right it's been over there only a few times ever over twenty and that's when usually <unk> about zero
so this clip kind of just sets the scene because what peter lynch is describing in this clip is actually what we see today he's talking about how the p e ratio of the market
generally sits between ten and twenty with twenty really being that upper end well now these days we have discovered what the ultra upper end of that number looks like and it seems to
and it seems to be
about thirty now that's kind of scary because what we currently see is a p e ratio for the market at thirty-five
and it's only been over thirty in three times in history nineteen <unk> nineteen <unk> and right now
so there's no question that the market is certainly hot just like the market was hot back when peter lynch did this interview
back in nineteen <unk> but the question we've got to ask ourselves is well how do we go about our investing in this environment
the decline yesterday in a sense it led off some of this <unk> the market was even <unk> at where it was right and by letting it off then we got back to what was reasonable
well you know i would say fairly price made for the larger companies they're now okay there might be some small companies we've had three thousand companies come public the last four years that's two of business day
some of those companies have gone down dramatically and and that that sort of a research zone that average people in the stock shop that's we can find if if some people know a lot about this ten thousand public companies
a lot of them are very attractive no one's following them and there's lots of people following i b m
companies that nobody else followed
right i'd i'd like to go to see companies with unions or companies in trouble or companies that no one likes
that have nice beds
yeah you have to look at a lot of them
you look panic hose your whiteboard that's the story
okay you got pure one imports my wife found that one too but but you have to look at twenty to find one it's just you know go to the mall and find the stock i mean you have to say my god this sounds like it's good then you have to do some steps you have to do an organized method
now that method we'll get to in a second but in this clip peter inadvertently describes exactly how we should be approaching our investing right now
because today even though the market is really high we're in an environment where actually a lot of businesses are going down
and what we see is that an index like the s p five hundred is actually propped up
by literally five to ten really high performing massive <unk> companies
now what peter's telling us in this clip is to be a great investor even when the <unk> really <unk> you have to get away from looking at just those massive <unk> companies
everybody's following these big companies everyone's investing in them and the prices for these big companies all sky high
so we should be broadening our horizons and looking maybe at the companies that come after the fiftieth largest stock in the s p five hundred
or maybe beyond the twentieth largest stock in the a s x <unk> because that's where you're more likely going to find value
and then the other secret is that of course you just have to keep looking at a lot of businesses
the best investors are the ones that turn over the most stones right as peter lynch said in this interview you have to look at twenty to find one
all right with that said now let's have a look at the actual steps that we should all be taking to go ahead and make an investment in this sort of environment
then you have to do some steps you have to do an organized method people are careful when they buy a toaster
careful they're careful and buy and see they do they do some research
but they don't do it with stock they call it the broker they see somebody at lunch and they said man i got this hot stock and you run right out and you spend five thousand dollars small investors
yeah well even more they put an option in international data which they don't even own international data ware save a ninety day
but bill said it was good and they make a lot of money
and it's and it's like a casino so it's like a casino you get the same results as if there's more paperwork
so this morning you get up and you go in and you look at at those companies had search that
that you know something about you have to have an itch maybe let's say the cement industry goes from <unk> to <unk> to fairly good the stocks are going north
you're gonna make money that's the industry you know when if you know the publishing industry you're you some people have you have an edge you work i mean one of your last thirty years
you worked at the restaurant as you would have seen taco bell you would have seen some barrels you would have seen pizza hut you've seen <unk> you've seen these companies doing very well you should have bought those instead of trying to buy biotechnology stuff you know nothing about
i mean i know nothing about local area networking lot of people are buying this cisco they're buying the equipment saying we're going to root together all these <unk> and put together the servers
they but but that's not a bad buy because they own a huge percentage of their market
you know what that was they're saying only a few people had that way my god if it works for us other people try it then colleges will try it high schools will try it they'll go overseas they knew they were early in the ball game
and they should have been buying that company instead of out buying something they don't know anything about some oil drilling company i'm feel it this tendency to always buy something they don't
all you <unk> okay charlie all you need is a few good stocks okay
this is your song this has been your sing from a long time here's by what you know
now but people wake up in the morning and say this there's five thousand companies out there which one should i buy the the average person ought to be able to follow four or five companies there would be a lecture on them they understand the companies
and this forces you this tool says to you right down the
have you keep saying this this
so that makes sense you have to start with obviously going ahead and doing some research you know he says people do a lot of research when they go to buy a toaster
why isn't it that people do a lot of research when they go to buy a stock you know don't treat the stock market like a casino
and then when you actually do sit down to learn about some companies look at the companies that are really relevant to you
warren buffett would use the phrase stick within your circle of competence peter <unk> example here is you know if you're someone that works in the restaurant the restaurant industry
look at pizza hut look at taco bell their companies that you probably already understand to quite a high level
and don't go messing around with you know these biotechnology companies that nobody understands so once you find those companies that resonate with you then you go in you do that research
and as peter lynch says you only need four to five good stocks in like a decade warren <unk> would argue you need even less than that
but you should know those companies well enough to be able to give a lecture on their business
so that's really the first step first step is to stay within your kind of circle of competence second step go in and understand those businesses in depth
and then after that what happens next well let's listen in
one thing you're trying to do all these public companies out there here's the company i really like the fundamentals are terrific their earnings are doing well the competitors are doing poorly
i think this company's doing terrific and all of a sudden the stock might have gone from forty to thirty because of this decline that would say wow here's a chance to buy it
so you're trying to say some companies might have been <unk> at sixty and all they did was go to fifty and say big deal so you're trying to find companies you liked anyway
right now you like them and now they've had a haircut that's what you would do you're not not just like the one from <unk> to fairly priced something was fairly placed at the start of the exercise
and then had a very you know a five for four sale
if you had been managing the <unk> fund this morning you would have been buying like crazy
i would have been researching like crazy i would been saying which companies are the same story is there anything really happening this is a <unk> for them they're still doing well inner fully have a recession
there's nothing do with them and that's the kind of kinds i'm trying to buy but let's say if a company just think of this as being you say to yourself i think this company's gonna earn something in the future
if it's already <unk> that if it's selling at a huge multiple you say it's already it has to work and then it's only going to stay even
so you have to say yourself if i'm right how much i gonna make if i'm wrong how much i gonna lose that's the risk reward ratio in stock shop we talk about if i'm right i hoping to double trip my money if i'm wrong
may i lose thirty forty percent that's a favor ratio you say if i'm right the <unk> not going to go up i already <unk> terrific things if <unk> terrific things are in the stock how do i know
okay so first step is to find a company where you've got the edge the second step is to really understand the business understand the <unk> understand the fundamentals
but then what peter lynch talks about in this environment where basically everything's <unk> what you want to do is you want to try and find companies that are just fairly valued
even in this extreme <unk> environment because as investors what we do is we buy <unk> stocks right we always buy at a discount to intrinsic value
that's how we know we make money in the long run now if you find a company that's really great but it's also really expensive in this environment
and then there's some sort of you know ten fifteen market dip and it brings the stock back down to fair value well then remember you're still it's still like paying
full retail for that stock so what we're looking for is great businesses that in this <unk> environment are just fairly value
so if anything does happen suddenly in the market something causes a ten percent dip or a fifteen percent dip then all of a sudden that business goes from being a fair value
to now being <unk> so they're the kind of situations we're looking for imagine this the new xbox one x console full retail
price i think is seven hundred and fifty australian dollars if you went into say
e b games and they were selling that xbox for you know that it was a thousand dollars and now it's dropped down to seven hundred and fifty
you're not getting excited by that deal because it's just come back down to full price but if that same store was offering you know it started at seven hundred and fifty full retail
and then it dropped down to five hundred well obviously that's a much better deal exactly the same thing with businesses in the stock market
and just quickly the other thing to note from what peter lynch said in this little clip was when he said ah if a stock is trading at a huge multiple it basically has to work
right and if it does work out then you're still just even now even today what we're seeing is some companies they might be great companies but they're trading at p e ratios in hundreds
if not literally the thousands like some companies for instance like tesla i think has a p e ratio of one thousand three hundred
now what this means is it means that the price that investors are paying today this is already they are expecting flawless continued growth
for years and years and years to come that's what the share price is telling us now if you invest in a company like this at these prices
then there's very little room for upside and there's a whole lot of room for downside because investors right now are already expecting years and years and years of perfection
right of absolutely perfect execution as peter lynch says you have to factor in if i'm right how much am i going to make
and if i'm wrong how much am i going to lose and that's a very in there is a very important couple of questions to ask yourself before buying into a stock
and that's where you go back to your discounted cash flow analysis and you look at the growth rates to figure out what that risk ratio is for the company that you're looking at
what you're saying to people today about the future of the market over the near term is what what's your feeling
we can take a coin out and flip it i have no idea with what next thousand points gonna do
the next six thousand points gonna be up the next fourteen thousand we have the next twenty thousand we have
but you don't know what next thousand would be
nobody does nobody does
in in it's few top to trying guess it cooperate profits could be lot hot ten years from now or be lower hot twenty years from now that's which go to rely on
the third key step the peter lynch try a lots in this clip is always focus on the long term
don't be worried about what the market would do next week next month or even next year what you should really be focused on is what is this company going to look like five years from now
in ten years from now always focus on the long term because if you can do that then short term market <unk> they really don't mind that
and you just don't stress about them at all in fact when prices go down you get excited you don't get scared
as <unk> have says in the corporate profits will be hotter than ten years from now there will be hotter than twenty years from now and that's what you have to rely on so
we rely on the fact that yes business is going to continue to prove it no maybe not over next two years maybe we sold the lock down where business is impaired for a whole year or two
it's still doesn't matter to us because we look for situations will what's gonna happen over five years what's gonna happen over ten years
and if that situation is favorable that's when we win this
what about all the criticism have we are <unk> it if then and the impact vein have had
that's what complicated me yeah
all i know was i mean i don't know it's way of my head and everybody to ask question in my life i know but you i times on your side when you are on stock you know i don't know about but you know three percent down buying in the future and scrap and scrap let's wear my hat
alright so you are optimistic about the future of the american economy earnings potential for most well run company will do all right
but people have to understand with it nine recessions of world war two
we'll have other recessions
not in one nail
but we may have one when the future and don't get worry about it'll have one sometime we will have one and well no one would tell you once that gonna happen it's
well well the one the fundamental was tell you
no you'll find out after the fact you all of sudden you'll notice is order slowing prices get more competitive than earns it down i mean usually find out after that no one declare <unk> insane we're gonna have recessions for five years just hasn't happen
it's great to see you you can come back anytime
you know i really like this last clip from peter lynch it's just a lesson you don't have too fancy right you don't have to drift into things that you don't understand like a lot of stocking investors
they are just all over options peter lynch is the first put his hand up says look a love investing companies i don't have a clue what's going on what comes to options never bought an option in my life
so you know step one find the business is your you know you understand
step two you know make sure that you can make sure you are looking at fairly value business that they can go under valued
step three focus on the long run find solid business with low death high cash flows and just keep focused on that stuff because that's the winning formula you know
we are going to see recessions in the future we've seen recessions in the past it could happen tomorrow it could happen next week it could happen in a years of time or five five years from now
but the main thing is the strong companies with solid cash flows that you understand that you going to hold for a long period of time
there is the ones that it going to make it through and there is ones we should be ultra focused on in any socket of the environment so
anyways guys i hoped you enjoy this video um i always like listening to what peter lynch has to say even in his really really old interviews ah this is from nineteen <unk> and yet
just because mark was high then mark is high now everything that is saying is almost directly applicable into what we doing with their investing today
and i love it i love it when we can draw those kind of parallels just like poetry
anyways guys hope you enjoy the video
leave a like on it if you did subscribed the channel if you not down so already
and make sure you check out portfolio links down to description below if you likes one of the hell i go about my investing if you'd like to learn about
you know a lot of key points in peter <unk> strategy in much more detail and kind of like step by step
and feel free to check out ah introduction to stock analysis the that loading me fourth way goes thank you guys very much for watching and i'll see you all in the next video
i'm bob klein from los angeles i wonder if you could give us a glimpse into your investment process the way you approach looking at a particular industry and i wonder if you could use real estate as an example
i know real estate hasn't been a big huge part of <unk> portfolio over the years and i wonder if that's because you view real estate as a commodity business
or if maybe the cash flows from real estate tend to be more predictable than perhaps from some other industries
ah it tends to be less likely to be <unk> and and therefore less likely to find terrific <unk> in real estate
so
go ahead
so just wondering if we could um if if we were watching a discussion between you and charlie <unk> out ah the merits of real estate how how it would go
well it would go like all our other conversations she would say no for about fifteen minutes and then
and i was engaged by the the by the degree to which the emotion he put into his notes whether you really like the deal or not
the ah
we we both had a fair amount of experience in real estate and charlie made his early money in real estate um
the second point is the more important point is that real estate is not a commodity but
it i think it tends to be more accurately priced
critically developed real estate more accurately priced most of the time
now during the r t c period when you had huge amounts of transactions and you had a you had an owner that didn't wanna be an owner in a very big way and they didn't know what the hell they owned and all that sort of thing
i mean you had a lot of <unk> then and i know a few people in this room that made a lot of money of that ah but
under
most conditions it's it's hard to find real estate that's really <unk> i mean when i look at when i look at the transactions that we can engage in currently and you get a lot of information on that sort of thing
you know they're they're very similar
but it's a competitive world and
and you know they all know about what a class a office building and you know in chicago or wherever it may be is gonna produce at least they have they may all be wrong as it turns out because of some unusual events but
but it's hard to argue with the current conventional wisdom most of the time in the real estate world
but occasionally there there have been some you know there there could be big opportunities in the field but if if they exist
it will certainly be because there's a there'll probably be a lot of chaos in real estate financing for one reason we've done some real estate financing and ah
you have to have the money shut off
to quite a degree probably to get any big <unk> ah across the board charlie
yeah we we don't have any
competitive advantage over experienced real estate investors in the field
and we wouldn't have if we were operating with our own money as a partnership
and if you operate as a corporation such as ours which is taxable under
chapter c of the internal revenue code you've got a whole layer of corporate taxes
between the real estate income and the use of the income by the people who own the real estate so
by its nature real estate tends to be a very lousy investment for people who are taxed under <unk> c of the ah code relating to corporations so the combination of having it
generally allows the activity for people with our tax structure and having no special competence in the field
means that we spend almost no time thinking about anything in real estate and then such real estate as we've actually
done like holding surplus
i'd say we have a poor record that
yeah c corps really does it doesn't make any sense ah i mean i know there are c corps around that that are in real estate but there are other structures that are more attractive there really aren't other structures
ah i mean <unk> is an attempt at it to some degree but there aren't other structures that work well for big insurance companies or i mean you can't have a walmart very well that does not exist in a c corp
they are not subject to s corp or partnership competition that determines the returns on capital in in in in the discount store field
but if you're competing with s equivalent of s corps
ah or partnerships or individuals
you you've just got an economic disadvantage ah as a c corp which is for the those of you who don't love reading the internal revenue code
corporation that you think of all of the dow jones companies all of the s and p companies and so on
and the ah the
as charlie says it's unlikely that that the disadvantage of our structure combined with the competitive nature of people with better structures buying those kinds of assets will ever lead to anything
really interesting although i would say that we missed the boat to some extent during the r t c days i mean ah
it was a sufficiently inefficient market at that time and there was a lack of financing that ah we we could have made a lot of money if we had been geared up for it at that time
we we actually had a few transactions that were pretty interesting but not but nothing that was significant in relation to our total capital
we thought significantly about buying the <unk> corporation when it became available so
but that's the only big one i can remember that we seriously thought about
yeah that that was in nineteen <unk>
yeah ah mobile oil was interested in you know don brent ended up putting together a report but you know that kind of thing
could conceivably happen but but ah it's unlikely
hello everyone and welcome to a very special edition of the u s chamber foundation's path forward series
if you've been a regular viewer welcome back if you're new to the series thank you for joining us we hope you find it both informative and interesting
and boys did you pick a great week to tune in over the past few months we've been bringing together experts in a number of critical fields
all around the topic of returning to work today we're thrilled to be joined by two of the most impactful <unk> in the world
bill and <unk> gates have dedicated their lives to advancing science and improving public health among other initiatives
the u s chamber foundation has a deep relationship with the gates foundation
for more than a decade we've worked together on both k through twelve and post-secondary education reforms
we've value their partnership and we're very pleased to have bill and <unk> gates with us here today
as you'd likely seen a few years ago bill brought attention to the risks of a deadly global pandemic sadly his warning is now our reality
the good news is that he and <unk> have committed themselves and their organization to finding a solution and that gives us all a sense of hope
the bill and <unk> gates foundation has committed more than three hundred million dollars to the global <unk> response
we're so grateful for their leadership during this trying moment and excited to talk to them today
this episode was <unk> to fit their busy schedules so there won't be audience questions at the end this time but there's a lot that we get to talk about and so let's get to it
well thank you very much for being with us we have so many questions but i just want to jump right in and so let me ask you both
what is the gates foundation doing to fight the corona virus and and why is it such a priority for you
our foundation ah has a
big focus on infectious diseases that you know kill ah millions of people primarily in developing countries
and so in our understanding about how you design a vaccine we funded a lots of new vaccines
ah we're partnering <unk> which actually buys vaccines for developing countries and we have a lot of the expertise that's not in the private sector to pick
which of these we should build factories for and how we coordinate all this activity and so it's become a huge ah focus for us
and of course the benefit of getting the vaccine you know even three or four months earlier ah ah will be very dramatic in terms of ah ending needs
awful economic effects as well as the ah death and disease
<unk> when do you think we'll see a vaccine at scale and and a two part question
because you've also talked um beautifully about the need to have an equitable distribution of a vaccine so kind of when do you see this at scale and what can we do to make distribution equitable
yes i think we all believe that just seeing the various vaccine candidates that are coming through the pipeline there are three that are looking quite promising luckily
and i think we all believe that by twenty <unk> we will have a vaccine
um we're working ahead of time with them with the manufacturers with the pharmaceutical companies to try and actually have manufacturing capability ready to go
so that soon as those trials are finished the vaccine can go immediately into manufacturing
and the whole reason we got involved in this vaccine was to make sure there's equitable distribution
the last thing you want is a bidding war between countries for this vaccine you know we know there are sixty million healthcare workers around the world
who are keeping everybody safe they deserve to get this vaccine first and from there you wanna do tearing in various countries
to make sure your most vulnerable populations get it ah in in our country that would be blacks and native americans people with underlying health conditions and the elderly
and so we need to look at as a globe and we're involved with many european leaders um and african leaders and others in southeast asia to make sure
there's a purchasing fund that can hold that vaccine through when it's available and get it out in wide scale distribution
gosh i have so many follow-up questions i'll try to stay focused so um let me go back to bill for a second you got widespread attention for prediction you made in twenty fifteen
about the dangers of a global pandemic and you sadly for the world did predict the future and so let me ask you to do it again you know what are you concerned about now
well this won't be the last pandemic that we face you know pandemics can come from ah natural causes
ah which is largely coming across from other species you know a flu for example ah is still a very big risk
and so we'll have to invest
in making sure that we catch the disease sooner and that we have platforms to make diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines very quickly
very little was invested even though there were these calls by ah a lot of people including our foundation
ah one group that was funded the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations <unk> c e p i
ah we welcome france norway u k japan were the initial funders and that is helping out here
ah so we're better off than if that hadn't happened ah but you know people trust government to think through
these eventual bad things ah this was a a failure ah to to get ready
and the cost would have been tiny compared to say what we spend on ah being ready for war we didn't actually do the simulation to think about
okay what about nursing homes what about getting factories ready what about the testing machine
you know in fact the testing could have been ramped up ah very quickly in a few countries that have almost avoided the epidemic entirely like
ah taiwan new zealand and australia you know they took their experience and actually prepared and so they moved a lot faster ah
so we
you know we'll have to prepare for the next one that
you know i'd say is ah will get attention this time
so you know that reminds me of going back to the vaccine <unk> and i promise to move off of it but you know we've never had a vaccine for a coronavirus
and that makes people nervous about this time so i think the audience will be so pleased to hear your optimism for this right but
what do you think is different this time that makes us think the development will happen is it this global coordination
it's this it's the pharmaceutical companies working together with scientists from all over the globe ah in a very coordinated fashion
we have never seen ah the companies come together in this way and also to be thinking ahead about manufacturing
and manufacturing not just for their own country or their own region but for other places in the world and so that's what makes us optimistic is the many many conversations that we're having
ah the way we're seeing the scientists move forward with the data as soon as they get it um and also seeing global leaders come together
like the european commission did a huge <unk> event for this vaccine alliance that we've been part of and seeing money come together to say
we need this so that it's ready when the vaccine is ready to go we can actually purchase that vaccine for the rest of the world
and do you think ah bill the same thing is true on therapeutics and testing i mean do you think that the way that things are coming together will get us where we need to be
on the other sides of the equation as well
well people are caught a little bit flat <unk> in that usually the u s is very well organized ah so the you know
this new drug that got proven out that's a a trial network we funded with others with welcome trust in the u k ah
you know usually you expect the u s to do good coordinated trials and you know to pick drugs for their scientific merit
ah the world has had a little bit of a hard time when the the u s testing thing ah went in the wrong direction
ah when it hasn't been a you know a federal notion of how you prioritize things but i have to say the european are are filling that vacuum particularly in terms of caring
for the entire world their generosity has been ah quite good ah you know people hope that the u s comes back ah
although you know withdrawing from w h <unk> is a step in the opposite direction but historically the u s you know we did smallpox eradication
<unk> been behind ah ah the polio progress that we've made which is done through ah w h o
and you know a substantial part of the u s money is ah that goes there is for that polio eradication and so you know there's still a chance for the u s
to contribute ah on this and you know not just thinking of itself but also ah in the same way we did
and particularly president bush and <unk> did ah helping out the entire world
you know you've both been really vocal about the need to make this a global response and to help people outside of our borders
so if you were talking to in this audience a small <unk> in in the middle of the country somewhere who might not understand that
explain why you think it's so important that we reach beyond our borders and help control this virus
well i think you know covid anywhere is covid everywhere and so for a small business owner
you know the supplies that come in that help you run your business don't all necessarily come from the united states
and your customers probably aren't all just u s customers and so if we want to have global trade and global supply chain
and global manufacturing we have to get the whole world coordinated in its response to this disease because it's not going to be able to be contained
in one or two places even once we've gotten it outside of the u s borders
yeah and to put it in perspective the u s has spent trillions of dollars to try and deal with the problem here we're only talking about you know less than a few percent
that of that that would need to be spent on ah helping get rid of the disease in the entire world
so it's not like there's some train trade off you know these are very small dollars just like you know the w h o is five hundred million a year
you know for things like reproductive health vaccines polio covers a a lot of different areas
and so it's not competing <unk> with the large-scale resources
you know your foundation does amazing work we've been lucky to be partners for a long time on some k through twelve education work
very very grateful to receive that support and amplify that good work and it makes me wonder about how the world is changing in a broader sense
as a result of this virus i mean what do you i mean <unk> let me go to you first what do you think we're gonna see in terms of some lasting changes
as a result of this health and economic crisis
well i think that's yet to come and i think you know it's up to us as citizens to rebuild the world that we want
i think this crisis has expose some of the gaps around the world but particularly in the united states
and one of those in particular are the gender and the racial inequities that exist
in terms of gender you know we know that women do two and a half times more work at home than men do and um that's the unpaid labor
caring for the kids making the lunch making sure their online learning right now
and so you know it will expose for us that is just way past time that the u s has a paid family medical leave policy we're the only industrialized nation that doesn't
and if we wanna put people back to work safely and keep their families safe from in from getting sick we need to have paid family medical leave
and so i think congress in its wisdom and two of the stimulus bills started to address that we need a long-term solution
the other thing i would say is not only has covid exposed the gaps in the system it's also showed us opportunities like the fact that kids could jump online
and start learning now unfortunately it's not all kids because many kids didn't have access to a computer or good digital literacy online
or teachers who knew how to tell each online but we know now it's possible and so i think now we will make sure that technology gets spread <unk>
and those great lesson plans and advising that can happen i think one last example i'll give on digital in the developing world
there are many many people who have phones and do digital banking on their phone they have access to money on their phone mobile money that was at scale in a number of countries
but all of a sudden people really said oh my gosh do not have to stand in line for my government payment where i might get sick
so just to take pakistan alone in forty-eight hours forty million additional people signed up for digital bank account that is an opportunity we can use
and particularly use to reach low income families and women on that phone with all kinds of things like cash transfers
more information more information about when health services are available so
though some of those digital opportunities are really hitting in ways we didn't expect as quickly as we had been had thought they would
i love that answer because i think there's a lot we're afraid of right now both in terms of health from the economy and how to write this social injustice ship
and there's a lot we're afraid of and it's nice to think about some optimistic you know outcomes for this too so the other day ah in an interview david <unk> asked me
what i had learned about working remotely ah and i admitted to him that i was conducting a lot of interviews without shoes on
i'm pleading the fifth about my <unk> state at the moment but what if you learned about yourselves in this time and and what has changed about the way that you're working
what's impressive dead for office work it
you know partly build you know on the relationships that you built up over time you could actually do quite well in our foundation has an ah
and nobody's been in the office you know for over three months now and yet our work ah is going on pretty much full speed
and you know because i'm if all the software i think okay we can make these software platforms even better
ah you know make it easy to take notes or share things or have side conversations
but it it's been decent enough to allow a lot to happen and it's certainly gonna accelerate the idea of do we need to travel as much
you know how good can we make online education how good can we make <unk> ah
it it you know it's like ten years of
progress on those things will get compressed down into just a couple of years
yeah
i i would say our lives you know like everybody around the united states have changed substantially um we're incredibly fortunate not to be struggling to put a meal on the table we just are lucky
um but yes our work lives you know working from home was not something we did as much before ah we're certainly using a lot of microsoft teams and zoom and other things
um like you suzanne i have changed i've claimed that when i go back to work i will not be wearing heels i am going to wear my tennis shoes because i wear them all the time now
for every single meeting including right now um and the other thing i would say is i'm not going to travel as much
i think there will absolutely be meetings i travel for and you know i still think there will be absolutely reasons to go to africa and southeast asia
but i think conferences can be changed and we're seeing many many people do them online now and so i do think i will travel less which i think will give me more time to just enjoy life
and take the breaks that i take here in seattle between my zoom meetings ah to step outside a little bit more
well i don't know that the world can take you guys taking too much time off i think we need your hard work and big hearts for the problems that we're facing
and you're really kind of has spent this time with us this evening so thank you both very very much
thanks again thanks for having us
it is very very rare and this program has been around for a long time to get in my opinion two of the really greatest human beings that we have living on this planet ah
today and both together and they've never been together before although i've had them individually
ah and they have so much in common
um bill gates and <unk> khan what do they have in common
the two of the world's greatest school and college <unk> number one
so if you're gonna drop out don't worry
this is your future
they are also um in a way moving on to phase two of their lives the new chapter um
i i can give you a little anecdote when about two years ago um or maybe a little more than that when bill gates was in his phase one of his life
and we were talking to a lot of software people rather than ah more interesting people like you
i asked him to give a sound check say one two three four
and he said one billion two billion three billion
he was counting notes that now he's counting people being saved by vaccination by vaccines in terms of millions and millions of them
it's a huge terrific change in your life phase two
and amir in a way you've also moved from of course you haven't given up your earlier ah acting career
but you have also moved on to social issues with this most <unk> television um program which had a huge impact
and everybody said you're nuts why are you doing this sort of stuff why don't you stick to movies so what motivated what what caused that change
you know i don't know i think it's ah
you know i was i was i had a discussion some time back and you know one of the questions asked to my
what are the what are the
what are the good qualities that a good n g o should have those questions asked to
yes
and he said that one of the good qualities any n g o should have any person who wants to be part of a social you know service should have is that ah
it's not just the emotion of wanting to do something with somebody else which is in itself a good emotion that you want to do something for someone
but if you feel that your life is incomplete if you don't
right
so you're doing it for yourself really
right
of course you are doing it for someone else but i think that that's what is important is and it's something that happens to you if you feel like it doesn't have to happen to you
but i think in me what grew was that this feeling that i that i needed to for myself to do something where i felt better about myself when i felt i was you know i feel i'm so privileged in so many ways
and i feel that i really feel that when i see around me people who are not as privileged and i can't just sit by and be comfortable with that
i i there's a need in me to ah you know reach out and perhaps
you're lucky to have a position where people will listen you'll
i'd like it to use it to the best of my abilities
so i guess that's why i've moved into the space where i have it's for my own emotional or mental you know peace of mind and satisfaction
and bill gates
you've also got a little more emotional in phase two
ah i i i've seen you almost choked up talking about your dad about how your wife motivated you how your dad's your hero and how all this means a little more to your heart than your head
so what motivated you to make this change
i think it's very similar i ah i loved my career in software and ah being part of building microsoft the personal computer industry the internet
ah you know my twenties and thirties i was <unk>
yeah
ah and i saw what innovation could do
ah but there came a point where i thought hey i should turn that work over ah to other people
and think about how innovation doesn't naturally benefit everyone it doesn't reach down um to the poorest in fact i've gotten a chance to see some of that as i traveled the world
and as a big believer in innovation i thought okay we we can push it in that direction
and so it's allowed me to learn a lot of new things
and i wouldn't be able to do it except for the the lock the visibility the resources that came from that first career
and i actually used a lot of what i learned then in terms of engaging scientists and driving innovation as fast as we can
and how important was your life and in this chapter two of your life
when i first said to my wife that i was considering ah retiring from my full-time work at microsoft ah you know
are you crazy
well no she she was careful not to jump on it because she wanted it to be my decision
yeah
you know that i would never look back and felt like that wasn't ah that i i really picked the time that i felt comfortable with that because they've been so central to my life
right
ah but she was certainly <unk> about it during my time at microsoft i'd always had somebody who is
my key partner paul allen
steve <unk> as the company became big and complicated
now in this era it's it's really my wife who is my
and so we get to do this together
and great motivator she is a driving force behind a lot of what you do
absolutely she's very energetic about these things she's actually in malaysia this week at the women deliver conference talking about reproductive health and how women get access to those tools
so ah she's equally passionate and also had a microsoft where some of the ways we think about measurement and managing people getting the best people
ah we've got a a common background
ah i mean ah when bill gates got launched into this phase two he talked to and convinced a lot of billionaires around the world especially warren <unk>
to donate a lot to have been philanthropic and donate to his organization or to other organizations and to do make change
what about in india we don't see enough of that we've got a great example of
who you highlighted in your
yeah in our show we we did ah showcase what mister
doing and i think he's doing really wonderful work and really we should all take you from that
and certainly i feel that i mean i do believe that in india there is a lot of philanthropy
yeah
huge amounts that we often donate but it's usually to religious
right
organizations we donate a lot to religion
yes
maybe that is a need in us to try safeguard
insurance policies
yeah you know because we feel that if you donate a lot to temples or mosques or you know religious institutions and and that's what i um i see most of the big donations are going so it's not that it's not that we don't donate
yes
you donate huge amounts but they're going to religious institutions whereas we don't donate ah you know into education or into health care
and i personally feel that if you if you you know donate into education and health care
ah the god up there is going to be really happy
probably be happier ah so i mean i think that i think it's time that that people who are well off financially in india and who would like to contribute to nation building
yes
to building this nation into what it can be and to try to achieve its full potential for the youth for the kids of our country
and for the for the you know the emotional happiness for all of us then that is one one area that we can really help in
do you think it's like
in in donating huge sums into education healthcare and other such things
rather than just religion
yeah do you think like you need two hands to clap that's a bit of a failure on the the lack of institutions that they can feel safe that the money is going to the right place
like if you donate to the prime minister's relief fund you just feel god knows what will happen where it will go part of the budget
but if you've got something on indian equivalent of the gates foundation or something where you know
i spend the money here it's not gonna go too much to salaries it's going to go targeted
i don't agree with that entirely um
because i feel that while yes we are concerned about you know where are we putting our money
where we are donating that's a concern which all of us should have certainly but i don't think that you won't find any institution or
and you you will if you really are interested i i don't think it's
yeah that's not a sufficient excuse as far as i'm concerned
so bill gates when you meet indian entrepreneurs ah billionaires are you getting any traction with them that they should also donate and to the second miracle a miracle of say vaccines
i'm sure that philanthropy in india will continue to grow
i think there's an awareness that although the government can do a lot ah that there are some things that are innovative
ah whether its good schools showing the way on that ah the people like
who i think do an amazing job and i'm sure there's others are out there like that
ah in agriculture there is
ah you know getting smart young people getting out there pushing innovative techniques
ah and so yes philanthropy is going to grow ah the only thing i do is i as people are interested in philanthropy i i share with them how much fun it can be
ah and talk to them about the fact that as you move from the place that you were successful ah usually in business you're going to feel a little uncomfortable
because you're gonna be in an area where the measures are not as clear
and you haven't had the twenty or thirty year period of experience where you're really familiar with the territory
i you will have to engage with the government at least ah to show the way on certain issues so it it's tricky
ah i think one of the earliest <unk> anywhere were was the <unk> family
ah they were actually a few years <unk> even before rockefeller and ah carnegie
and i learned a lot from those early foundations ah because they were pretty brilliant at what they did
yes
ah and i think the more people give the more awesome <unk> cheese there are the more it makes other people think okay should i do the same
and so i i hope
ah that ten years now we can say that this was the golden era of philanthropy in indian the rest of the world
and you you do find some traction when you talk to them
absolutely the interesting discussion is is very strong in fact you know they've been a number of meetings and ah people are finding their way
that boundary of how you connect and you know show models for the government ah that's take some capacity building is taking place
ah the u s is in this respect further down the learning curve there's no lack of ah places ah to give
and some agree the the universities have to reach out a little more and say okay here's a program that you could fund
they and they should look at how that's happened in the u s ah which is
very organized beautifully organized universities of america
so when i was teaching this was one of the tests that i will i will ask you know how you know you're an artist that's the main question and you know
to known when artist or not is like breathing you don't question breathing you have to breathe otherwise you just die so you breathe so if you wake up in the morning
and you have some ideas and you have to make them and this become like a kind of almost obsession when you have to create and you have this urge to create you definitely an artist
but you're not a great artist you're just an artist to be great artist there's all different types of rules and and you really have to
you have to kind of it's like ah it's like the <unk> to you like ah it's like it's nothing else in your mind
the only advice you ever hear is something you already know and it just gets confirmed if you think of all the advice that you heard fifty million pieces of advice people
and then maybe three or four pieces of advice you can think of having taken
when i was really young william <unk> told me um and i was really struggling we never had any money and
and william the advice that william gave me was build a good name you know keep your name clean
don't make compromises don't worry about making a bunch of money or being successful be concerned with doing good work
and make the right choices and protect your work and if you build a good name eventually you know that name will be its own currency
the only advice i have is probably thing is a lot of young musicians and artists already know is that
although some of them may have the ambition to be the next um the next <unk> or the next whatever
whatever it is um the number of those artists are very very small
um and often the artists who are very successful that way
um they
they don't have much flexibility it ah in achieving success they can lose a lot of their creative freedom
and have to keep making the same thing more or less over and over over again and that if the musician artist ah values their freedom and their
the ability to be creative then may have to maybe realize that they wont be making
hundreds of millions of dollars they might be making less money but they might have more artistic satisfaction
painter photographer filmmaker video artists whatever you do
nobody else can do that better than you
i think you know the thing is we're not in in a real kind impart any kind of wisdom to anyone else we're so immersed in the bullshit of our own activities
to know even how to give anyone advice so
my advice to younger artists will be something like
to be very sensitive to where they are in what times and what part of the world and how that
constitutes their artistic practice their artistic inquiry
i think the great artist have to be ready to um fail which is not many people do because when youth have success
in certain way than in the public acceptance of certain way you start somehow involuntary <unk> the same images the same type of work
but and you are not risking and the real artist you know always change their territories and they go to the land they're never been and their
this unknown territory and then you can fail and you can risk and did fail actually is what makes this this extra
you know ready to fail that makes great artist
so it's not that there isn't a thing to say to artist but a miss there specific thing they're going to hear is
it's not worth their while listening or you worth your while telling them so i think it has to do specific interaction of the person giving the advice and the person receiving it rather than
broad nostrils work hard
do your best do what you like and people will respect you for it it doesn't matter what's subject you take on in the end whatever you do is going to be a <unk> it will reveal who you are
if it's arrogant it's about you if it's pretentious that's about you don't think you can escape yourself by your choice of subject matter
um but there many things like that this term can say but unless someone is needing those words
that don't get hurt
make your own way in the world
that's wrap up warm wrap up warm eat properly sensibly
don't smoke and find your mom
find your mom
i had a very old professor like really which i love very much and he give me two <unk> he said to me if you're drawing with your right hand
and you're getting better and better and we can wish it was so that we doing a close eyes
you can draw anything you want immediately change to the left hand and that is very important advice because because when you become routine that is end of everything
and the second bit of advice he say to me you know your lifetime you probably will have one good idea if you're a really good artist
and if you're genius two good ideas and that's it but be careful with them
don't do anything that somebody else that you know deep in your heart somebody else can do better but do what nobody else can do except for you
well i think the best advice is is i thinking working with art is working with something that is very fierce very strong very robust
and
even though the whole world seems to say that art is fragile should be marginalized it's not important it's <unk> it's
you know doesn't belong to the centre of what the what reality is defined as artist should have confidence in the fact that well making
a drawing on a piece of paper is changing the world
by definition making art is making the world so it is an unbelievably rewarding thing to be an artist
and to be full behind that idea as a young artist and to actually see that having chosen live in many perspective strange charts to become an artist
it's also to have chosen to be a part of the world
to be a to be an artist actually to be a human being in these times its all difficult you have to go through life hopefully
you know trying to stay healthy you know being as happy as you can and and and <unk> you know doing what you want if
what you want is to have children if what you want is to be a baker if what you want is to live out in the woods or try to save the environment
or maybe what you want is to write script for detective shows it doesn't really matter you know what matters is to be is to know what you want
and pursue it and understand that it's gonna be hard because life is really difficult
you're gonna lose people you love you're gonna suffer heartbreak sometimes you'll be sick sometimes you'll have a really bad <unk>
sometimes you'll be hungry but on the other end you'll have the most beautiful experiences sometimes just the sky
sometimes you know um you know a piece of work that you do that feels so wonderful or you find somebody to love or your children or
there is beautiful things in life so when you're suffering just you know its part of the package you know you look at it we're born
and we also have to die we know that so it makes sense that we're gonna be really happy and things are gonna be really fucked up too
one of the oldest art forms painting has been around ever since our ancient ancestors first started producing charcoal creations on cave walls
while countless generations of artists have left their mark over the <unk> only some arts works have succeeded in <unk> time and culture to be revered around the globe
here's a look at the most famous paintings of all time found in museums around the world
number twelve american gothic now hanging up in the art institute of chicago
american gothic is one of the most famous paintings of twentieth century world <unk>
grant wood's defining masterpiece was painted in nineteen thirty and depicts a farmer and his daughter standing in front of what is now known as the american gothic house
initially locals and art critics took the somber tones and <unk> <unk> clothes as a critique of rural life
the onset of the great depression however saw the painting become associated with the <unk> and indomitable spirit of the american pioneers
number eleven the persistence of memory one of the greatest and most distinctive works of <unk> art of all time
salvador <unk> the persistence of memory really does stand out from the crowd
in the nineteen <unk> painting we can see melting pocket watches draped across a bleak landscape
the strange scene is widely thought to have been inspired by albert einstein's theory of relativity
<unk> fantastic creation can be enjoyed at the museum of modern art in new york
number ten the kiss painted between nineteen o seven and nineteen o eight during the height of <unk> <unk> golden period
the kiss <unk> <unk> and shines before your eyes as gold silver and platinum radiate forth from the canvas
influenced by both the arts and crafts and art <unk> movements the painting depicts two gold clad lovers <unk> in an intimate embrace
just one of the many highlights of the <unk> in <unk> extensive collection the kiss is <unk> most popular and <unk> work
number nine <unk> another of the art institute of chicago's most famous art works is <unk>
which was painted by edward <unk> in nineteen <unk> in the oil painting we can see four people in a <unk> late at night
light shines out of the brightly lit interior illuminating the darkness outside through the large glass window
while many take it to depict loneliness and isolation <unk> himself said it <unk> more to potential predators in the night
one of american <unk> most popular and <unk> paintings <unk> is the most renowned and recognizable of <unk> art works
number eight the great wave off <unk> the most famous painting to come out of japan the great wave of <unk> was produced by <unk>

the stunning scene with it's vivid blues sees an enormous wave threatening to <unk> three fishing boats
as it was developed as part of the artist's thirty-six views of mount <unk> series the iconic volcano can be spotted in the background
due to the fact that numerous prints were made original impressions of the great wave of <unk> can be found in the british museum and metropolitan museum of art among others

the night watch is one of the most magnificent paintings to ever emerge from the dutch golden age painted in sixteen <unk> by <unk> van <unk>
the enormous canvas portrays a group of civic guard as they head off to practice their shooting
for much of it's existence the painting was coated with a dark varnish which gave the incorrect impression that it depicted a night scene
leading to the name night watch the painting is famed for it's dramatic use of light that makes it seem as if the life size figures are actually moving before us
number five the scream the scream is a series of <unk> paintings and prints by norwegian artist edward <unk>

and recovered several months later in two thousand four another version of the scream was stolen from the <unk> museum only to be recovered in two thousand and six
number four girl with a pearl earring although it is often compared with the mona lisa
<unk> vermeer's girl with a pearl earring is in fact a <unk> not a portrait
thought to have been painted around sixteen <unk> by the dutch master the <unk> artwork depicts an imagined rather than a real girl
wearing a blue turban and a <unk> glimmering pearl earring tracy <unk> wrote a historic novel <unk> the circumstances of the <unk> creation
the novel inspired a two thousand three film with scarlet <unk> as the <unk> <unk> assistant wearing the pearl earring
number three the last supper painted in the fourteen nineties on a <unk> wall in a monastery in milan
the last supper is one of the most recognizable artworks on earth
while the years have not been kind to the original the convent still sees people coming from all over the world to catch a glimpse of the fabulous fresco
the marvelous emerald depicts the scene where jesus christ tells the twelve apostles sitting to either side of him that one of them will betray him

number two starry night vincent van <unk> defining work starry night describes the view he could see out of his asylum window

and is one of the most valued works in their extensive collection
number one mona lisa widely considered to be the most famous painting in the world
the mona lisa has delighted <unk> ever since it was painted in the early fifteen hundreds by leonardo da vinci
the painting is named for lisa del <unk> a member of a wealthy family in florence
in nineteen eleven the mona lisa was stolen by louvre employee <unk> <unk> an italian patriot who believed the mona lisa should be returned to italy
after having kept the painting in his apartment for two years <unk> was finally caught when he attempted to sell it to <unk> gallery in florence
today the mona lisa hangs again in the louvre in paris where six million people see the painting each year
today we're visiting true garden it's a vertical <unk> food farm i was really excited to go here
because i originally stumbled across true garden and their farm on instagram and it's so cool looking it's just a series of columns
that are covered in different vegetables and fruits that are completely fresh and i was mostly interested to see
what the biology of growing food was like because vertical farms grow food in a very different and sustainable way
my name's troy <unk> i'm actually a licensed <unk> as i've done consult on with my patients i realize it starts with the food they're putting in their body
troy is a licensed <unk> by trade he went through school in a very modern medical way of doing things
and through the process of having children of his own with their own illnesses and conditions and also being overweight himself
he changed how he approached food and what he put in his body and it changed everything for him in his family
my parents and grandparents were farmers in minnesota and we had black soil there here in arizona the soil is like this red clay stuff
sure
so if you don't amend it and really work that soil you don't get a lot of good quality produce out of it so when i saw the tower garden i can control the environment
i control the water i control the nutrients i love this i can control every aspect of growing my own food
so how does this whole process work basically the first step is to put whatever seeds you want into the coconut core
this grow medium here is <unk> core it's actually a certified organic grow medium and it's a by product of coconut husk and you throw it put your seeds in there
and then once they're one to two inches tall like this then we can come over here and and just plant these right in here they fit right in the in the pod
you throw it in the pump turns on every three to fifteen minutes depending on the program pumps the water and the nutrient solution all the way up to the top and then just using the law of physics
yeah
what goes up comes down right
yeah
and it just rains down there's a shower cap rains down and hits all these spots
so something i find interesting is that you only need that amount of soil
right
like you <unk> just miles and miles of dirt and soil to grow plants but you only need that at now
yep that's all i need
for every different plant that you're growing
ah nope just that small amount it's actually not even soil it's coconut husk if we use soil we'd have a lot more bugs we'd have to use pesticides and <unk> and <unk> i choose not to use any of those here
organic is what that's clean yep just food
yeah
do you think that's really happening today
well by the way you just said that now
vegetables typically that are transported into your state by law even if they're organic are sprayed with pesticides
so that's not ideal
the problem is our soils are depleted there the f d a has lots of studies showing that when those leafy greens are cut and travel what on average twelve hundred to fifteen hundred miles to get to your plate
they come across pesticides
yeah pesticides are there ah fifty percent less nutrients they've lost up to fifty percent in some cases there's hardly any nutritional value
here look at some of this basil ah let's grab a beautiful basil point you pull this out look at those beautiful roots on there
oh my gosh
i mean look at that
that's insane
this is <unk> days old yeah
the vegetables that we saw at true garden were just growing right there there was no soil there was minimal water
it was really just their roots hanging in these hollow tubes being saturated in nutrients and substances and growing to be the most beautiful vegetables
i mean if we pull one out here it's like a beautiful bouquet let's get one out of here so you can see i mean the the roots and you got these beautiful
now i know what my bouquets gonna be for my wedding
yes
oh my gosh it is so soft
yeah isn't that something once you try a piece of that
vegetables have a much more vibrant and bolder and fuller flavor then i think most of us have experienced
feel like it tastes different than what i'm used like i feel like most <unk> lettuce taste so watered down
summer's over this is even better
sweeter i don't feel like i've ever tasted <unk> that was this sweet it's stronger it's more unique from vegetable to vegetable
because you're not getting that dirt flavor a lot of that comes from growing the fruit or vegetable in this coconut husk
and feeding it with these nutrient substances without any soil it's amazing
i don't know how i haven't eaten vegetables this fresh before and i feel like everyone needs to like i buy expensive freaking <unk> at the store
all organic everything i i whole paycheck at whole foods it happens but it doesn't taste like this
well <unk> grow most <unk> in sand so a lot of times when you crunch on <unk>
you got like a <unk> taste to that
that's the sand that they grow it in so you always wanna rinse it well and get rid of that
one of the the craziest things i tried was the <unk> leaf
here try just a piece of this just a real just a really small amount
what is that
it's a natural plant <unk>
i just wanna eat this as like an after dinner dessert and then i will never eat ice cream again
isn't that isn't that so sweet isn't it
yeah i have had the <unk> powder but never a <unk> leaf oh that is <unk>
this is the actual <unk> plant here
wow that's amazing you could use it in so many things and it is so powerful i also tried a mint chocolate herb
and it tasted just like mint chocolate
so once we have a sprout we put it in the tower <unk> days later you have that things grow so fast
<unk> days
yes
so what happens is you get accelerated growth because the roots can get a lot of oxygen
since there's no soil there's no weeds which is amazing because <unk> weeds is literally the worst weekend activity ever
vertical farming it's just your head of lettuce or your kale or your <unk> or your berries or your tomatoes no bugs no weeds
what is the actual benefit of having a vertical farm versus having a normal farm that we're used in
big part of this with the vertical farm we're really saving on space we can use ninety percent less land but we can grow ninety percent more food
when you go brook like this this is one tenth of an acre we can grow ten times more food as a result of going vertical
plus our resources we use ninety to <unk> percent less water that's huge i mean what three percent of the water in the in the world is fresh water
so it's not just a commodity here in the united states but all over the world having fresh water so we got to really conserve our resources and if we don't
we're setting ourselves up for a major catastrophe
how many people do you think you could feed like just out of this space
out of this space we could easily speed um gosh ah ah hundred families on a weekly basis
wow as we all know our world is changing the land available to us is changing the quality soil that we have on our earth is changing
and this may be the most sustainable way to feed our communities moving forward if someone watch this video and wanted to start gardening tomorrow or today
what would be like your top three tips for doing that
grow the things you love to eat keep it simple use clean water use good quality <unk> we've got residential models
as well as commercial farms
residential model
so the residential model is about five or six feet tall just like you are and um one to two towers could easily feed a family of four depending on what you're growing
you're gonna be exposed to less chemicals you'll love it you'll really love it
i was a skeptic i absolutely thought the biology of this food must be different if we're not making it with soil and the same amount of water
and the same amount of sunlight as the vegetables and fruits we're used to but the matter of the fact is it's better it's got more nutrients more minerals
it's more dense in the rich vitamins that your body needs and it's just more environmentally friendly
you know as a <unk> <unk> i do <unk> and i got into this because i really saw not just my own kids but my own patients that were missing the food part
they were missing that nutrition part and as i corrected nutrition in them i'm like i'm like this changed their whole life
we were taught in pharmacy school just give a drug give a drug give a drug drugs are just <unk> they don't cure us if if you don't have good nutrition
that foundation that we're building our body on isn't there and so that leads to all sorts of things you know depression <unk> gut your gum disease
people that are constantly having headaches and they're not growing properly or kids don't grow properly cause of nutrition so start with good foundation
if you have a good good foundation with nutrition eat it what you grow or buy it locally you're gonna be way healthier
so crazy how your diet can affect pretty much everything it's hard to put into a sentence how cool and interesting i thought this whole experience was
i've always been a firm believer in what you put in your body matters and the food you put in your body matters
and we are allowing food industries to spray it with pesticides to transport it super far change its enzymes and nutritional benefits
so that when we're receiving the food it's not even giving us the fuel that we need to survive in a healthy way
the body is an incredible piece of equipment machinery you put good stuff in it gets good stuff out you put bad stuff in in time bad stuff would come out
but you can't correct it it just takes some some effort on our part to do what's right who said that <unk> you are what you eat but food be medicine not medicine be food
he said a lot more eloquently but ah you know i firmly believe that
true garden was quite possibly one have of the most beautiful things i have ever seen it was pristine it was green
not fake green not sprayed on green it was beautiful vibrant green
and the oxygen in that greenhouse i would like to one day live in a greenhouse with that pure oxygen
i'm really grateful for the opportunity to learn about my health to learn about my food and also to share the information with you guys
in hopes that it maybe changes one thing you don't have to change everything overnight do one thing that will make you better tomorrow than you are today
thank you guys so much for watching it was one of my favorite videos to make and share with you all if you care about health and wellness and wanna learn more
you should definitely watch our tutorial on how to make natural cleaning supplies because what you spray around in the air around you matters too
so we're gonna get this play all they way down ah when that i'm <unk> this morning
good morning everyone if you have not already don't forget to hit the subscribe button ring that bell
videos every tuesday and friday at odd occasion we do this sunday video what is going on i'm gonna take a couple of polls
today's video i am walking into my cow field we have moved the electric fence back into this field and we're gonna look at something very exciting we're doing something very exciting today
you'd have seen when we put the cow brush back up in january it was very wet it was very horrible
it was gross but the cows loved the cow brush
currently have two cows who fight over brush surely this means i need another one
they absolutely loved it you'd seen them using it all the time this is in the past couple of weeks
and the guys at mayo cow comfort and <unk> who'd like to send me another cow brush
but this cow brush is something different a cow brush that goes into the field
so obviously our cows are happily grazing we have about
ten standing up and over hundred and ten are chilling out bellies full of grass
getting a bit of that sun our plan is they are going to send me a cow brush that goes into the field which is great
so instead of using my brand new fences that we did for a viewing area back in the farm shop we are gonna use a cow brush which is gonna be fantastic
i was thinking of putting it in with the highlands that are in the paddock there but then i thought why give it to highlands when there's only four
when we've got hundred and twenty-three i think in the moment in the milking hood
why don't we put it here so it's gonna get used literally twenty-two times more
<unk> is coming soon and we're gonna find a position to put it up
i'm gonna guess here cause i want to have it in area where the cows can use it people can see it from farm shop when they come out of the farm shop and they see the viewing area though
horse and the highland might be something else coming as well but yes very exciting so that's the idea
i'm gonna put a white pole to say this is where i would like it
this is the position and <unk> coming in early <unk> imagine you're a normal human can you see this here this is me pretending to be a cow brush
there's yeah
all we're doing now is we're gonna wait for mayo cow comforts to come
so we had two positions and i think your ride does take that one out
it's a little bit further away
<unk> always right
ah
just to accept it
not very calm with it
<unk> back chris did such a good job we'll send him again he'll leave with chris today
we haven't got marco and <unk> unfortunately they are still in finland through this whole thing going on
was it as easy for them to pop down just just pop over you know <unk> here for top <unk> because it's just a human job
to get it in
hi chris you're back
and i think <unk> there as well shovel how big is this hole gotta be
it's the size of ash
okay so you put that down yeah and then go round it
so i'd like it here chris
that's all that's the middle of it
exactly where the post was is exactly where the middle has to be
precisely where it hurry was
now i didn't shed it away
happy
i want you to think i figured out in squares
we have just take it out the circle around the base has to be ten to fifty centimeters in then chris stood it in like thirty seconds
just a bit warm
what's next up christopher
double check that this fits that we've done it perfectly but i have no doubts
me and chris did it
how does it work now chris
twist this into the ground this is the anchor
okay
we knot and twist tie the poles to the cows and right then walk
see that would be better idea or something
cow power instead of horses we have two horses in there
i thought i'll tell you i'll tell you which one would do amazingly easily on your little <unk>
so we're gonna go get this play all the way down there when i'm <unk> this morning
cows are looking at you say hurry up tom could do with a good scratch
i think so i feel like your heads down you know like the game when we go out that drinking game
so i'm gonna happen to just go stop first
easy took that hoof
just like ten minutes
just warm yeah
i think the warmth
i see it all in chris
it's quite good if i don't say so myself
all to do with how the bars were set up to um screw in
all three with the muscle behind the bar walked you out to smoked plum chris told ya
hell of a piece of metal again
you'll see it soon but it's massive
with the play on set this on soft bolt it all down for the bristles on last
amazing just get the cows out of the hole
next one pick everything yeah
bolt ah washes
wow
shocking handling from us
this side and then we'll do this side
we just put the bolts in
she's in
out fire <unk> down three foot four foot down that screw four foot down that screw you can see where the brushes are gonna go we are firmly in
um me and chris will get some brushes put on
look at that confidence in these is terrific these are the same brushes we have for our cow brush which they absolutely love
they have a is it a year guarantee
bristles are year guarantee and they still work it has a two year warranty and you can register online for the full three years
all you gotta do is register online
that's it register when your brush is installed
amazing we're gonna guess it's as easy as we um the last time but we'll find out
my brush is not this clean anymore it's only been here for like five months
and they have absolutely used it loads so obviously it's gotta have a bit <unk> on it and i'm not <unk> to clean yet which you can do with the brushes
i'm pressured to clean it but i haven't got around to it yet
first two on the same way okay
i have everything on all the bristles one of my beef cattle is already on its way to play with it
laugh a little bit it's just a tension point which just keeps it all tight ready to go
big shout to chris for being on camera again when he probably didn't want to as much but he's he's done a great job
and it's been up for an exactly about fourteen seconds
and we've got something playing on it i'm gonna film it every time they jump on it we're gonna see them enjoying life
and being the happy cows that we know they are in the field
look it up that is perfect perfect a big
thank you to <unk> and mayo cow comfort for coming
and installing a cow brush if they saw that the cows loved in this back shed and they um they have brought one for my outside because we know these cows are outside
for six months a year as well it it's part of their range again it needs no power
it can live inside it can pressure wash outside and what you can do as well is you can <unk> the base of it
and then we can put it into the concrete area so if you gotta large out a large area where cows kind of roam a free roaming and <unk> area
if you wanna be technical you can place it inside for the other six months when the cows do come inside so it's very versatile
perfect for us we don't have the space to put this inside currently but who knows things could change and cows straight on it
guys thank you very much thank you to mayo comfort and <unk> for placing it we do appreciate please give the video a thumbs up
subscribe the youtube channel ah t p merch at premises farm shop okay okay slash

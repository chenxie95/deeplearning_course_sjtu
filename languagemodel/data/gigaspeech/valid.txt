hey friends i don't know about you but when i was a kid i knew absolutely nothing about money well there is a new show from marketplace brains on that will help address just that
<unk> <unk> is new podcast for kids in their families its all about money how it works how we use it where comes from and how we could all get a little bit smarter about it but in a fun way
million <unk> helping dollars make more sense this podcast is presented in partnership with <unk> the debit card for kids listen and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts
leila green is a trauma surgeon in houston
i meet people on the worst day of their life usually
well then i guess i should be glad we didn't meet in real life before leila could become dr green she had to do a whole lot of training
and you know what's really hard to do when you're working a bonkers number of hours eat properly
i was in general surgery residency at the time and kind of tired of eating like hospital food or fast food and things
and that's when she heard about this service a meal kit delivery that would send her all the ingredients she need to make three full meals plus instructions on how to make them no more <unk> trips to the grocery store and no more desperation big macs
so i thought well i'll try that i got a free box and so i said okay i can do this and i lived by myself um so i thought it would just something fun to do
what green is conveniently leaving out of her story is her level of cooking experience <unk> kit
i can heat things up
like
i had to buy so many different things like once like these boxes started coming you need all these like ah these equipment and things that i didn't have i had to buy <unk>
and like i didn't have a garlic press what is this okay but i i you know i'm a surgeon so i have to have all the right instruments where do you
you know to put this stuff together
getting a meal kit every week did force green to upgrade her kitchen <unk> game but more importantly it gave her back time something that as a trauma surgeon she does not take for granted
plus the meal kits helped green hone her cooking skills forget just pressing cook on the microwave green is now a master in the fine art of <unk> plus
you know you have to learn how to like chop everything up and set it aside and
right
you know you really do have to feel like you're cooking things cause you really do have to put everything together
right now i would think if you were a surgeon your knife skills wouldn't be too bad
oh no i mean i can i can cut people and carrots okay i can you know
in the year that green subscribed to that meal kit delivery service she made seared steak and pizza from scratch and a whole host of other things she would never normally prepare for herself and she documented her cooking journey on instagram
but eventually green finished her training and got back to a more regular schedule which allowed for grocery shopping and meal prep so she canceled her subscription
which was bad news for the meal kit service she was using blue apron you may be familiar with the company from such podcasts as all of them

when blue apron began in <unk> it was supposed to <unk> how americans ate it was going to gently pull us away from our <unk> and our t v dinners and nudge us back into the kitchen and for a while it worked until it didn't
and americans returned to the warm embrace of their boxed mac and cheese and takeout pad thai obviously a <unk> revolution didn't materialize
or did it the novel coronavirus has forced many of us to become intimately acquainted with our <unk> dishes and our garlic presses and our dutch <unk>
we made banana bread by the pallet and sourdough starter by the ton we learned how to sear <unk> and <unk> chickens and all manner of gruesome <unk> techniques in short boy did we ever cook
all this cooking at home created a maker break moment for blue apron but it wasn't supposed to be like that just a few years ago the company was valued at two billion dollars now it was barely hanging on by its <unk>
it's only lifeline a global health crisis so required so many of us to shelter in place for months and avoid trips to the grocery store
i'm lauren <unk> and from american public media welcome to the new seasons of spectacular failures the show that always <unk> the hell out of failure
legend has it that the idea for blue apron began with an <unk> steak there were these two guys matt <unk> and <unk> <unk> they were clever tech entrepreneur types
full of ideas <unk> had an m b a from harvard and cut his teeth in a big new york venture capital firm <unk> was a <unk> software engineer they met at a <unk> happy hour and decided to go into business together
but what kind of business
their original idea is not meal kits it is more of a research crowd funding idea called petri dish
that's alex <unk> he's a senior editor at forbes he wrote about the founders in <unk> petri dish wasn't the <unk> only startup idea
i think another one we highlighted in our article was <unk> parker for <unk>
i don't even understand
a high end but also affordable <unk> experience um yeah
so those two startup ideas a kickstarter for science experiments and a <unk> parker for <unk> were <unk> for the pair but then over grilled meat it hit them
<unk> and <unk> are doing dinner and they're struggling to ah make <unk> ah <unk> on a borrowed grill
and they're like you know wouldn't it be great if there's a service basically for amateurs like us
in fact there was but it was in sweden in two thousand seven a woman named <unk> <unk> created a company called
<unk> that translates into dinner peace in english
let me see if i can pronounce this right <unk>
da that's pretty good
<unk> wanted to solve the <unk> nightly problem that families around the world face what are we having for dinner because the answer can't always be ice cream
people started talking about hell hour hum you know like the hour between five and six when you have to run to the grocery store and ah fight with your spouse about who's cooking tonight what are we having
that right there is the spirit of entrepreneurship
i think the question is then is this a legitimately huge problem and is this a problem that a lot of people had as well
for <unk> and <unk> the answer to both of those questions was an enthusiastic yes now at this point it was <unk> and <unk> company had been around for five years and was growing steadily
it had a few competitors in europe but in the u s nothing of the sort existed which was great for <unk> and <unk>
and so they think hey we can start our own meal kit company for the u s market called part and <unk>
to be clear that's a terrible name and very quickly they changed it to blue apron named for what french apprentice chefs wear in the kitchen
at almost the exact same time a harvard classmate of <unk> began a rival meal kit company called <unk> but <unk> and <unk> weren't worried because they had brought on a ringer
matt <unk> a chef with a degree from the prestigious culinary institute of america and <unk> was the guy that was gonna make their business stand apart from its rivals
<unk> would basically go and source the ingredients farmers would say okay we would love to lock in these large extra orders
at a scale that is very um attractive to us you know many thousands of ingredients i think you know when he was in his food world that was a <unk> and great for blue apron
not only did <unk> design the menus and source the products but he also served as his social media face of the company he was blue <unk> culinary secret weapon and did a series of early youtube videos <unk> his <unk>
here he is trying to convince us that <unk> aren't vile
everybody likes <unk> but they're crazy what do you do with them they're tough they're spiny they're all over the place they're kind of confusing a lot of times people just don't cook them because they don't understand how to cook them so
he cuts into some truly revolting <unk> and proceeds to make my worst dining nightmare
get in there with a spoon and scoop out that really hairy <unk> interior and the reason why they call it the choke is because if you eat this you are gonna choke it's full of little fibers and it's like a fish bone
in the early days all the founders had to hustle like this before they had staff it was <unk> <unk> and <unk> packing up boxes in a small kitchen in long island city new york
then seemingly out of nowhere the company landed some sweet venture capital to the tune of three million dollars things were looking good for the startup
within the first few years the business took off in <unk> blue apron was shipping six hundred thousands meals a month by <unk> it was eight million meals and a billion dollars in revenue
within just five years of its founding the company employed forty-five hundred people and was valued at nearly two billion dollars blue apron looked like it was on the express train to <unk>
blue apron seemed to be sort of the <unk> the biggest market share the leader in this emerging category
which included <unk> <unk> and about a million companies with the word chef in the name
then i actually tried the products and it seemed at least to me personally just as someone um testing the products that blue apron overall kind of had the experience that resonated the most with me and i thought might resonate the most with americans
now the thing about americans is
we love products that claim to make our lives easier more convenient less of a <unk> and that's exactly what blue apron was doing it was saying hey working mom we know you have a lot in your plate l o l
we want to help you cook <unk> and delicious meals for your family without the <unk> of going to the grocery story or reading a cookbook
but it was also saying hey millennial we know you're a work hard play hard eat sloppy takeout at nine p m kind of person but we also know that you'd love to cook if only it wasn't such a <unk> pain in the ass
so we're gonna make it super convenient for you
this american obsession with convenience around food and in particular the magical <unk> meal minus the effort goes back to at least to the late nineteenth century says culinary historian laura shapiro
that was when a particular brand of utopian fiction began to emerge
the plot was sort of the same somebody is taking a walk they get <unk> on the head when they wake up it's five hundred years in the future and they're surrounded by all these strange looking creatures and it's a whole different world
and somebody takes them to dinner they take them home to dinner and it's a miracle dinner
the food just appeared with the press of a button or the wave of an arm and it was scrumptious and filling and most importantly back then <unk>
miracle food it was utopian food and that has been a dream i think that is attached itself to the american dinner table for decades and decades
not long after the emergence of this utopian fiction <unk> actually did start to look like a miracle you could buy vegetables in a can and chicken in a can and later full meals like spaghetti and <unk> in a can
then in the nineteen <unk> came the frozen turkey dinner just whack it in the oven and <unk> a <unk> <unk> of the real thing but it was quick and <unk> was a breeze
mother murphy lucky me my wife uses <unk> t v turkey dinners and make your husband lucky too get <unk> t v turkey dinners <unk> t v fried chicken dinners
<unk> t v beef dinners from your <unk> big freezer
when frozen fish sticks hit the scene around the same time oh buddy it was utopian fiction come to life
master chad <unk> ate mrs paul's fish sticks with his fingers
now i'm thirty-two and i use a fork sometimes
mrs paul's fish sticks you'll never stop loving them
it was an immediate success these you know <unk> frozen fish sticks that tasted not at all of fish which meant that ah that people adored them
obviously fish sticks took off and the industry used that as an excuse to <unk> everything chicken <unk> <unk> beans whatever you could deep fry and freeze the packaged food industry tried it
the post-war years also brought an explosion of fast food and takeout meals and now the twenty first century we can order just about any food we want from some vegan <unk> to a prix <unk> <unk> cuisine meal just by pressing an app
all of these iterations of the miracle dinner it's like they aim at three <unk> that women have always had when they think about making dinner they want it to be effortless
they want it to be delicious and they want it to have the moral value of home cooking
the home cooking aspect of this is perhaps the most resonant
the thing that home cooking delivers that none of these other things do is that it satisfies i think what we all feel as the moral imperative to cook
there's something that just doesn't click in when the thing comes in from outside
and this is a great thing for a company like blue apron because
blue apron inches a little closer to that it it just it gets you that much closer to feeling as though you have cooked to this
notice shapiro said feeling as though you cooked something because for her what blue apron is doing despite all of its fresh ingredients and chef inspired recipes is helping you assemble
they kind of fool you into thinking you're cooking where is real cooking hands-on cooking knowledgeable cooking has to do with cooking day after day
doesn't mean you're making fabulous elaborate meals day after day even if it's the simplest possible thing that's cooking
sure getting a dime bag of <unk> a <unk> of <unk> and a literal <unk> of sesame oil in your meal kit does have a somewhat <unk> effect
but in blue <unk> early years plenty of people were happy to have everything <unk> out for them but convincing potential customers that they wanted and needed a service like that that cost the company some big cash
in the form of free meals tons of <unk> and endless advertising anyone who listened to podcasts in <unk> through <unk> is bound to have heard at least one disinterested podcast host give a <unk> blue apron ad read
in <unk> speak all of this is known as the <unk> or customer acquisition cost
what it's supposed to be is the total amount of money that the company spent
on marketing to acquire customers divided by the number of customers that they actually acquired
that's dan mccarthy he's the marketing professor at emory university's business school and he's studied blue apron for years mccarthy says that in the early days blue apron was spending about sixty seventy dollars per customer
but then as people came and went blue apron had to spend more and more money to get new customers on board the customer acquisition cost just kept creeping up and up and up until it nearly doubled
and you can imagine if you're spending a hundred twenty just to bring somebody in ah when you talk about the amount of profit that you need after that to to break even on that customer that's a tougher proposition
the more money blue apron spent the harder it was to <unk> the investment which brings us to the second problem preventing customers from <unk> once the company has spent all that money to bring them in
how many customers stick around is measured by a really important metric called churn rate the churn rate tells you the rate at which customers come into and spin out of the business
if you're spending a lot of cash to land new customers and they don't stick around long enough to make any money off of them you have high customer acquisition costs and a high churn rate
that's where blue apron found itself and even the most basic cooking dodo could tell you that's a <unk> recipe for losing a lot of money
our pal dr green used blue apron for about a year which is way longer than most of its customers stuck around
yes about half the people were churning out in a month by six months about seventy percent of their customers were churning out they just weren't weren't able to keep those customers for as long as they they should
despite blue <unk> early success and growth one nut the company's never been able to crack is how to stop that <unk> how do you get people to subscribe and stay subscribed at least long enough to make a profit off of them it's a puzzle
but despite its high churn rate blue apron was still the market leader it had gotten a slight <unk> on rival <unk> and it was starting to look a real sexy to big investors
they were the eight hundred pound gorillas and even though the space itself wasn't that that large at the time it was still something like five billion dollars and growing really quickly
on its face business seemed booming but the whole meal kit market was on the cusp of a <unk>
in <unk> grocery chains <unk> and <unk> each picked off competing meal kit companies then another blue apron rival <unk> abruptly shut down and laid off all its employees only to be bought a week later
and so blue apron was at a crossroads says alex <unk>
for startups the most common <unk> are you know you fail you go public or you get bought those are really the only traditional outcomes and so for the companies that didn't wanna fail they were gonna have to go public someday or sell
like that that's that's just the reality
so blue apron had three choices pack it in sell or go public we're going to take a quick break when we come back join me in my outdated condo kitchen as i whip up some delicious blue apron meals
and we explain how the really terrible coronavirus was also a little bit good for blue apron plus we gaze into our meal kit crystal ball to see what the future might hold spoiler the future is delicious

no story about blue apron could be called complete without sampling the product so i ordered up a box and paid for it mind you
okay so i just got my blue apron box at my doorstep and when i picked it up i could not believe how heavy it was
when the box arrived it felt like christmas except better because the food wasn't mediocre and arranged in a <unk> basket
so let's crack into this box
inside there were two bunches of <unk> some loose onions and about a million tiny <unk> of nick <unk> including two <unk> of <unk> <unk> a quarter of a cup of <unk> <unk> and one teaspoon of something called <unk>
which according to the blue apron recipe was supposed to quote lend even more <unk> flavor to my dish <unk>
there's the tiniest the tiniest tiniest portion of brown rice i mean this must be maybe half a cup in a bag maybe three times the size
i decided that it would be sad to cook these dishes by myself so i invited my girlfriend over to experience the magic of blue apron with me
you have a choice between meals tonight
i'm so ready mostly because i'm so hungry
oh well we had the choice of three dishes but one of them had <unk> sauce so no thank you another was like a spicy indian situation and i was feeling kind of basic so i chose the <unk> and kale pasta with goat cheese
it says this <unk> pasta gets a <unk> punch of irresistible flavor from a <unk> of creamy goat cheese for delicious tang and our <unk> basil <unk> stirred into the warm pasta and <unk> kale just before serving
by the way that was a wrong
a touch of crushed red pepper
technically we picked the easiest dish so what things were going well until i dropped a garlic <unk> down the <unk>
oh hanna no get your hand out of the garbage disposal
after that near catastrophe we boiled the fresh <unk> <unk> the kale with garlic and red pepper flakes added the <unk> and the <unk> of goat cheese and voila
can i get you a bowl of pasta
what why yes
you could
and i'm here to report we made a damn fine meal the kale was tender crisp and very well seasoned the <unk> was perfectly al <unk> well done hanna and the cheese added some good <unk>
i would say we were perfectly satisfied diners but wait there is more
cleanup is practically nothing because everything came out of a packet so really we're only left with
actually that's really nice
a couple of dishes
i don't want to underestimate that i think that's really nice
but not everyone who's used blue apron has appreciated that the company has gotten <unk> for its abundant packaging though much of it is now <unk> and customers have complained that the recipes were too complicated
i made four blue apron meals for this story and for a <unk> cook with a reasonable amount of <unk> i thought the dishes were pretty simple to assemble also pretty tasty
i would make every single one of those dishes again but i do the shopping myself which i guess sort of defeats the purpose
when i opened my first blue apron box it was a novelty a <unk> and cardboard but then i forgot to cancel my subscription and i got a second box by accident
that one wasn't as exciting by then i understood the <unk> and the excitement of discovery kind of <unk> in this way i'm not too different from a lot of people who try blue apron says professor dan mccarthy
discovery doesn't tend to last that long there's a bunch of people they look at blue apron as this it's like i want kind of this surprise and delight every month
and the problem is that they may want that initially but after you've been surprised and delighted a few times you say you know i'm pretty good i i don't need any more of this surprise and delight
but blue apron <unk> were like ah yeah you do you need it and you want it and they believed in their <unk> ability not just to continually delight but do actually provide a valuable service to people
and all that meant that in <unk> the company had to work out its options pack it in sell or go public
and the <unk> decided on going public
now before offering up public stock in the company for the first time blue apron wanted to show strong customer growth so they started to amp up spending to bring in new users
remember <unk> the customer acquisition cost in the year before the i p o blue apron increased its marketing cash by almost two hundred percent
but none of this marketing resulted in a huge new customer haul and that says <unk> alex <unk> made investors a little less in love with the company
it was hard to make a really attractive you know <unk> story for like how blue apron really becomes that huge
blue <unk> books weren't the only thing that made investors turn up their noses around the i p o a couple weeks before the blue apron team was set to ring the bell for new york stock exchange amazon made a little announcement
it was buying whole foods in a thirteen point seven billion dollar deal for blue apron it was like getting <unk> at your own wedding by an impossibly rich and infinitely more beautiful guest of a guest
when amazon's acquisition of whole foods was announced that was just devastating um even just psychologically it felt like um you know here come the giants
and if amazon can sell things too online really well and whole foods has pretty good ingredients what is blue apron really selling here
and then of course amazon <unk> its own meal kit offering
everyone was ah very concerned that and basically this was gonna be the next you know i i won't call blue apron end you know but i would say everyone agrees amazon's way bigger so
they're just gonna bold their way right in and and stamp this this industry out and so that that was a big lurking concern
blue <unk> i p o in the summer of <unk> raised three hundred million dollars about a third of what the company anticipated stock went for about ten dollars a share rather than the expected fifteen to seventeen dollars
it was a turbulent um i p o to say the least
soon blue apron co-founder and c e o matt <unk> seemed pretty upbeat about the whole situation on c n b c
i'm honestly not here to really talk about the pricing of blue apron stock that's really up to the investors to decide you know blue apron is here because we're excited about the big opportunity that we're going after
we're tackling a huge market and we're focused on the long term quite frankly and the stock price today whether it's up down left or right is really just the beginning of this new chapter in our company's life that we're really excited about
one thing <unk> mentioned in that clip was how his company was tackling a huge market now if you're defining the market as all the people who eat food in america then yeah that's a huge market
but according to the good folks at market research company packaged facts that market has a ceiling and not like a cathedral ceiling
initially the market was definitely expanding exponentially and i think that's where a lot of the interest initially came from if you're seeing these companies that are having a hundred percent growth like that's really significant
that's cara <unk> she's a food and beverage analyst with packaged facts
one of the whole things that i think went wrong with the industry is people thought there was a very big <unk> market for meal kits but as it turns out there really isn't
it's hard to gauge but <unk> estimates that only about one percent of the u s population uses home delivery meal kits and she says the market kind of peaked two or three years ago
since blue apron started more than one <unk> meal kit services have come on the scene but only about fifteen to twenty are national operations with <unk> now the clear market leader
remember when we said amazon <unk> its meal kit back in <unk> <unk> says the company never did much with it and that's a pretty good indicator that meal kit delivery is not a growing global concern
i think that amazon saw that much of the market for meal kits had already been addressed by the competitors that were already there so they didn't try really to break into that because they didn't see much potential for growth anymore
it seems like amazon was right to hold off in <unk> blue apron <unk> two hundred fifty thousand customers and its stock price had <unk> just two dollars and <unk> cents a share by the end of the year
and there were more problems within a month of the i p o co-founder matt <unk> stepped down as c o o matt <unk> then the c e o resigned his post shortly thereafter
blue <unk> expensive brand <unk> new fulfillment center in new jersey had a bunch of tech bugs that needed to be worked out and workers from its california operation filed a <unk> lawsuit over a alleged missing wages
things were looking pretty grim for the <unk> company
welcome to trading nation i'm eric <unk> let's take a look at one of last year's high profile i p <unk> that's getting absolutely smoked we're talking of course about blue apron the stock sinking as much as four percent on friday
by the end of <unk> blue apron stock dipped below a dollar a share and the slide didn't seem to be letting up
the following summer the company tried to move meant to keep it from being booted from the stock exchange it's called a reverse stocks
split and basically it means that the company bundled it shares so you get a fewer total number of shares but each share is worth more like trading in four quarters for a dollar
the move raised the company's stock price but customers still weren't <unk> to blue <unk> boxes now at this point i would have thrown in the towel but not c e o linda <unk> <unk>
the company wouldn't make <unk> available for a chat but here she is last year on c n b <unk> <unk> on the <unk> about how <unk> she is about blue <unk> prospects
and our recipes our ingredients our culinary authority our brand recognition is by far still number one so we feel confident that when we're talking to investors they appreciate and understand that there's something here it's really just about getting execution right and making sure that we're actually
cool cool cool but also blue apron was thinking about getting down with some strategic alternatives says <unk> <unk> garcia
strategic alternatives which you know doesn't means a lot and and nothing at the same time right
it's like saying i'm totally happy being single but i'd be into dating if the right person came along
it's kind of like one of those things that companies will say when they're just like well we'd be open to you know getting bought or a partnership if you're interested you know kind of a thing
in early <unk> blue apron put the word out that it was interested in possibly getting scooped up maybe by a big grocery chain or someone else with deep pockets who wanted to own a meal kit delivery business
at the same time garcia says the company acted like it was in turnaround mode it decided to streamline operations including shutting down its fulfillment center in texas
it also did away with trying to shovel everyone who had ever eaten food into the top of its customer funnel
they've decided to focus on what they call their core customers and these are people who aren't going to do like a lot of people and use a coupon and you know get blue apron for a month and then cancel their subscription
so at the same time blue apron was looking to sell it was also doubling down on its mission these were <unk> efforts it wanted to save itself
and then came the most unlikely lifeline anyone could think of a global pandemic a highly contagious virus that required those of us without essential jobs to practically never leave our houses
online grocery delivery shot through the roof and suddenly everyone remembered about this company they heard about on a podcast ad three years ago
the pandemic has been actually a bit of a good thing for them because it has raised demand
blue apron sees a lot of potential in what the company is offering especially given that more americans seem to be interested in cooking at home thanks corona
if you're blue apron then you're probably thinking you know well if we do a good job some of this will stick
in the first quarter of <unk> when coronavirus brought america to a standstill blue apron customer orders were up a bit though they didn't spike like the markets hoped the company still lost twenty million dollars but that was a little better than the previous quarter
on its first quarter earnings call of <unk> the company's c e o and c f o shook their <unk> like they were on an episode of cheers but like the version that features slightly wooden corporate executives
so now i think the combination of those thing um you know puts us in a good position going forward and and ah you know we can't specifically um guide what can happen in the second half of the year because of all the uncertainties
you know we do believe that there will continue to be some positive um effects as we move out of q two
the pandemic seems like it's given blue apron a decent little boost in the second quarter the company brought in twenty thousands more subscribers but that's still way below where they were in <unk>
it's anyone's guess whether blue apron specifically and meal kit delivery more generally are here to stay the business <unk> <unk> founded in sweden thirteen years ago is still delivering weekly meal <unk> to busy <unk>
and despite its own turbulence market leader <unk> is still cranking out boxes and there's no shortage of small meal kit companies looking to fill paleo or vegan or regional cuisine niches
no one knows what the true impact of a global pandemic will be on how we eat and where and when not yet anyway grocery delivery seems like it's here to stay
maybe high-end restaurant takeout will also stick around in some form it's hard to tell whether all those people who took up home cooking out of necessity will continue to bake <unk> sourdough and whip up elaborate <unk> when we can all safely frequent our favorite local spots
blue apron is banking on a sea change in how americans eat the company that was shopping for a buyer just a month before the pandemic hit is now trying to turn a <unk> global event into a <unk> opportunity
one big blue box of food at a time

but that really really changed for me when we traveled to rural connecticut to spend some time with <unk>
i've lived on this farm for twenty years ah before the two boys and it's really my dream place
<unk> named this place wild rose farm there a few chickens <unk> in a wire coop behind a muddy pasture where there's also a horse
this is one of the oldest farms in <unk> county
really
yeah the house is <unk> so older than the united states of america
we get there in time to watch her feed the animals including her constant companions three dogs <unk> rocky and olive
he's hungry too
i think he thought that the mike was a dog watch out
so <unk> leads us inside the house and i remember we took our jackets off in the mud room and hanging there was a <unk> <unk> ski jacket
and <unk> stopped and she pulled out a pair of these <unk> teeth out of the pocket joke teeth
i always say that he wore these little teeth cause he was such a <unk> to school every day
little silver teeth
yeah
ah
<unk> son jesse had these teeth in this coat at sandy hook elementary school the day he died
my name's <unk> lewis and i'm the founder of the jesse lewis choose love movement
and i founded this organization following the murder of my <unk> son alongside nineteen of his classmates and six educators in one of the worst mass murders in u s history
here in sandy hook connecticut in <unk> <unk> lived through every parent's nightmare
and following that i realized that ah there isn't a they out there
and by they she means someone else who's gonna come into our schools and our homes and help kids replace their anger and violence with warmth and compassion
right then we come into the sunny kitchen which is painted turquoise and bright yellow
every surface is covered with paintings <unk> done and photos of jesse and his brother j t
and one of the cabinets has <unk> paint on it and on it is a message from jesse
we we hardly ever use this this is ah <unk> <unk>
<unk> didn't notice this message until she returned to the house several days after the shooting to find clothes for jesse to wear in his casket
she walked in and froze
i saw that nurturing healing love and i couldn't believe it
nurturing healing love you can see those three words they're spelled <unk> in a <unk> jagged <unk>
i thought it would never be able to come back here i don't know why i'm crying cause usually i don't sorry
i'm usually really good at keeping it together ah just give me a moment ah
<unk> says she has no idea how or where her little boy came up with those three words
but the moment she saw them she realized
this is my life now i knew i would be spending the rest of my life spreading this message
and by the way six years later you can tell what a moment it was because it's all i talk about it's all i do
it is the focus of my life every waking moment every breath every word that comes out of my mouth is about nurturing healing love really

so cory yes kindness is important but i guess i always just assumed that my kids would learn it naturally through <unk>
just if you love them they'll become kind
well you know what anya you are not alone in that assumption
we often just expect people to be kind without talking about it
we think oh you're a good kid you're gonna be kind
that is jennifer <unk> she's one of our expert guides today through what turns out to be a pretty complicated subject
kindness has been a part of sesame street from the beginning so it's not a new concept but
but she says the folks at sesame and lots of child development experts are starting to notice things warnings
not only in the headlines but in research
and that brings us to our first takeaway that parents and teachers are sending kids really mixed messages about kindness
exhibit a is this study jen points to out of harvard a few years back
<unk> children for example thought that their parents valued academic success over kindness
in fact about eighty percent of children believed their parents were more concerned about good grades and their kids careers than whether they were caring towards others
eighty percent and the parents on the other hand they got surveyed too
and they didn't realize this they they were totally wrong about the message that they thought their kids were getting
yeah and this kind of like <unk> this is just one of many reasons <unk> worries that this culture is creating huge problems
now at epidemic levels
and i'm not talking about just school violence and bullying and loneliness but also substance abuse and mental illness
and of course her life is a really stark reminder cory of just how high the stakes can be when we talk about things like mental health and kids who are troubled
sometimes it's frustrating for me because we act like we don't know what to do
and we do know what to do
after she read that message from jesse <unk> lewis reached out to a team of researchers and educators and she created a plan to essentially teach children kindness step by step value by value
yeah the jesse lewis choose love enrichment program they estimate it's now reached over a million students
in fact in the past decade or so schools all over the country have woken up to the idea that they have a responsibility to teach kids how to treat each other
yeah and not just to prevent the next tragedy but also because research tells us that these <unk> skills often called social and emotional skills
they make up about half of the equation that determines whether kids are gonna be successful in their lives
so let's follow <unk> lead and sesame <unk> and talk about how the science of kindness can translate into action
takeaway number two
kids are born to be kind
but also unkind
here's what we mean
so on the one hand people have neurons in our brains called mirror neurons and they respond in the same way when we experience pain like we're picked by a needle as we do when we watch someone else experience pain
it's a mirror
it lights up the same receptors in our brain as physical pain
soon after birth children for example will be more likely to cry as a result of hearing another child cry than they are in response to any other sort of noise
thomas <unk> says we see signs of what is called empathic distress even in tiny babies
he's a psychologist who wrote the book on how to raise kind kids literally
that's what it's called he's also been a family counselor has two kids and fifteen grandkids
and tom told us that babies moral sense seems to go even deeper
studies going back to the late <unk> have found infants as young as three months old prefer a kind or helper puppet over a mean aggressive character
so this is like i was saying cory i always thought kids are just born to be kind
yeah but the problem for kids is that there are also a lot of barriers to kindness
for example there's a small study of <unk> who were exposed to another child's distress say a friend fell down on the playground
only about a third of the kids actually responded in that moment with altruism with kindness by say going over to the child offering a hug calling for an adult
zachary
let's check on him bella he's trying to check on you
he's trying to help you up
yeah and we actually saw this kind of scene in-person on a recent trip that we took to a preschool on the campus of eastern connecticut state university
i'm gonna help bella
oh great let's see
what a kind friend
let me help you bella
and it really got me wondering would my kids be that one in three would yours
yeah i don't know i mean i really hope so
but what is it that gets in the way of that kindness that act of kindness in the moment
a bunch of things
ah young kids are naturally <unk>
sure
every parent knows that
ah so they might just be oblivious to another child's pain
you know and there's also individual temperament right
so some kids
they really can't handle other kids pain they they shut down
or maybe they're really shy they're waiting for someone else to step up
you know decades of psychology research tells us this is a grown-up problem too
sometimes the presence of others automatically serves as an <unk>
but there's also another more disturbing barrier to kindness that adults really need to understand here and it's prejudice
so there's another yale study of six to <unk> babies
ah um
they wanted a puppet that did not share their snack preference punished
punished
yeah so it's not just that these babies showed a preference for those who look or behave or think like they do but also a kind of hostility to those that don't
wow
yeah so for all these reasons children and grown-ups alike don't always reach out to help
instead we often do the opposite
it's true we hide from other people's pain we run away from responsibility
and that's why <unk> says
you don't really need the skills and tools
what you need is the courage to be with somebody in pain and just be present
and that's our third takeaway
kindness requires courage
the jesse lewis choose love program for kids from <unk> through high school actually begins with courage
and i wanna mention that reports of the shooting said that jesse himself showed incredible courage
when the shooter stopped to reload he yelled run and the investigators said that he saved many of his classmates lives in that moment
yeah and <unk> definition of courage is even bigger than that sort of
courage
heroic courage
um for her it includes the courage to reach out to a hurting friend on the playground or or a child you don't even know
yeah absolutely i i mean the courage to offer comfort to someone who's lost a loved one even if the idea of death is really scary to you
it's also <unk> says the courage to stand up to someone who's bullying you or someone you know by taking their perspective and seeing the world through their eyes
gosh you know what would make you act that way
what's going on in your life
i feel compassion for you
ah ah i see the pain
is there anything that i can do to help ease that pain
you know hearing about courage in that way in that moment really spoke to me cory because i have to admit this
i was a little afraid to sit down with <unk>
i mean someone who had gone through something that i as a parent fear so much and to look that pain in the face
but the way that she has transformed that experience into a positive legacy is is so inspiring
one really practical way <unk> choose love plan builds courage is by teaching kids to stay calm
they practice brave poses and brave breaths to stand up tall like superheroes and calm down their bodies and their minds
yeah there are few different reasons for this which make up our fourth takeaway
yeah takeaway number four
kindness takes mindfulness
jen <unk> at sesame says if you're more aware of your emotions you'll also be more aware of everyone else's
and you'll be less likely to lash out violently in frustration or anger
<unk> is something we all struggle with
and that's why mindfulness is so important and really learning how to manage our own emotions
and i think the earlier that we can practice those skills the better we'll be in adulthood
in fact the folks at sesame are so convinced of the connection between mindfulness and kindness that they like to use a special word <unk>
you hear that <unk>
anyway lots of the social and emotional learning programs introduce tools like meditation relaxation yoga to help kids work on this <unk> connection
so we talked about the courage that it takes to step in when someone else is hurting even if that person is being hurtful towards you
and how to cultivate that quiet in your mind that lets you do that
our next takeaway is about what to do when your child hurts someone else accidentally or intentionally
or on the other hand when someone else hurts your child
takeaway number five
apologies are a skill
and forgiveness is a gift you give yourself
yeah before jen started at sesame workshop she spent her days in a classroom
i remember when i was a preschool teacher briefly that we were told we don't force children to apologize to each other
and i remember in my early twenties thinking that's absurd
you should totally tell children to apologize to each other
the problem jen found out with forced apologies as that they're usually pretty worthless
sorry
they don't even realize that that they're supposed to mean it you know or feel it
yeah so tom <unk> and jen <unk> both told us instead of focusing on kids <unk> the words sorry
we should help them really take the other person's perspective and this is important repair the harm done
yeah and this is a great tip
jen says you can actually take a moment like this
and direct one child to look at the other child's face and posture
and this helps them learn how to read feelings
so it's really about more conversations and about looking at emotions and emotion knowledge and looking at faces to see how your actions affect other people
jen says sesame street has improved over time in how it depicts apologies on the show
it now has characters discuss what went wrong and why and how to make it better
so <unk> might say i was really wanting to play with my scooter and i didn't want to share it
and i realized that you probably wanted a turn too
and i should let you have the time with it
you'll get it zoe
but but but wait what about your turn <unk>
<unk> <unk> can be patient and wait for his turn
so what do you say zoe
and then the other character would say yes that's how i was feeling that you weren't sharing
and it was hurting my feelings and then when you shared it made me feel better
yeah
all right nice job sharing <unk>
all right thanks
so in that interaction you're giving children a lot of language to describe how they're feeling
that may be a lot to expect from a <unk>
but you know apologies are a skill kind of like learning to scooter
and they improve with practice
yeah and starting these kinds of conversations early is crucial to raising a child who runs to help when somebody's hurt
so remember that small study we mentioned of kids on the playground
well it also looked in-depth at the parenting styles of their mothers in different situations
when one child hurt another many of the mothers responded with something casual and bland
yeah like oh don't do that
but the researchers found that the moms of the helper kids those one in three who ran to help they were different
yeah they were warm and nurturing but they also took it really seriously when their child hurt another child
so they'd say something like
you hurt amy
pulling hair hurts never pull hair
and as a result the child was more likely to take it seriously later on and respond <unk> when she saw another child crying on the playground
tom also says that children should learn to make an apology of action
what we grown-ups might call restitution if you break something you fix it whether it's a broken toy or a hurt feeling
this is also where things get hard for us grown-ups too
yeah
because all the experts we spoke with were really clear kids do what they see
and <unk> lewis says that means when parents screw up we need to apologize too
wow mom made a mistake you know
ah and i <unk> what just happened here
and i got angry i'm sorry you know can you guys forgive me
if anything <unk> talks even more about the other side of an apology forgiveness
that's one of the four core values of her choose love program along with courage
and she says when she first pitched the program people weren't sure about forgiveness
that's a very lofty topic for kids
don't you think that's a little too complicated
not at all she says
the choose love classrooms have turned forgiveness into a hands-on exercise
we literally take string and scissors and we cut the cord um because that's how i talk about it
like if you're angry at somebody you're attached to them with an <unk> cord
and it runs out of your side into the side of the person that you're angry at
i love this too because <unk> is really focusing on the benefit of letting go of anger
and she says you know holding onto anger it can be as bad for your health as smoking cigarettes
and it was at this point where sitting with <unk> in her kitchen her back is to her refrigerator which is covered with photos of jesse and her other son j t and we just had to ask
we've been talking about forgiveness
did she forgive the person who murdered her son
absolutely
without hesitation yeah i i without hesitation i absolutely forgive him
so we've been talking about kindness in the darkest hours those moments of conflict
loss and pain hurt and anger
and those are really important
i mean that's when you really need kindness
yeah but how do you build kindness up
well if you want to really grow kind people there's a lot you can do when things are good when you are full of joy
that's our takeaway number six kindness grows with sunlight
what do we mean by that
you have the raise the capital of kindness
<unk> simmons helps run the social and emotional programs for schools in oakland california
and she focused a lot on kindness when she taught elementary school
you have to point it out
you have to name it
you have to appreciate it when you see it
for example every day she'd hold circle time
and a lot of times she'd ask this
you know what were some ways this week where your classmates were kind to you
turn and share a moment where you felt someone was being really kind
tom <unk> says it's not just about celebrating kind actions
it's encouraging kids to identify as kind people
yeah because people are more likely to be kind if they see it as part of who they are
yeah this idea of taking special notice when people are kind to you well another word for that could be gratitude
yeah part of how <unk> keeps going she told us is by constantly reminding herself even out loud what she's grateful for
my gratitude lists are all day long
and i start in the morning by ticking off ah the sun's out and ah i can get up out of bed and literally like i'm ticking them off all day
um and when you're focused on gratitude you're not focused on the <unk> thoughts
and tom agrees
there's a payoff to practicing gratitude in this way
not only can raise the stock of kindness in your family in your classroom but research shows that people who are thankful are also happier
yeah he suggests that at <unk> for example families go around and mention their <unk> that they're thankful for that day
yeah we do this in my house
all right who wants to go first
me um i'm thankful for animals and pandas
thank you for this food and this day and that my <unk> today
it's not always easy
sometimes um my guys don't really want to do it they just want to eat
thank you for um this breakfast um
and
but we do it
the point of all this is to really carve out a time in each day for your kids and you to acknowledge you know we're not self-sufficient
ah we're not islands
we need other people and other people need us
that's a great point cory i've got to try that
we've come to our final takeaway takeaway number seven kindness requires
practice practice practice
yeah in fact <unk> lewis says
we were gonna change the name of our program from choose love enrichment program to choose love enrichment practice
and similarly tom says kindness as a virtue isn't random it's a habit
and that's not just calling out kindness when you see it in your kids
it's giving them lots of opportunities to be kind you know
and you can start with chores at home
chores yeah that's a really good idea
so tom says you know not for an allowance but just to give the message that this is what we do to help out because we're part of something bigger
and for my daughter lulu who's seven that chore ah really is taking care of the cat
you know when we got the cat she promised that she would help out not only with the feeding but also the litter box
this is really giving her the message that there's another creature depending on her
yeah totally
and you can also and should you know take this model this idea and take it out into your community
you know have your kids help pick up trash in the neighborhood or help folks at a shelter
raise money for a good cause whatever it is
and here's the really good news tom told us
getting our kids to be helpers to be in service it doesn't just benefit the grown-ups that they become
doing this regularly actually feels good chemically
it's what brain researchers call <unk> high
doing a kind act lights up a part of the brain that let's us experience joy
and that's why he says we're happier when we're helping and jen at sesame agrees
kindness really does make you feel good
and that's why <unk> says we should talk to kids directly about this <unk> high
there's so much science that shows and i say all the nurturing healing love that you give out you get back
so this is getting me thinking more about that study of middle school students that we opened the episode with
um ah
you know our kids they hear from us every day do your homework
study for the test
how well did you do
and they hear us talk about sweating some promotion or working hard on a project
but you know do we ever stop and ask them were you kind in class today
yeah did you help somebody who was hurting or sit by that kid who always eats alone
it's no wonder our kids so often think that we value grades more than kindness
so i'm thinking more about how to raise the capital of kindness at home
and we've gone through these great strategies right
yeah yeah i mean the the goal here everyone we talked to said this said this word
they used the word culture
you have to create a culture of kindness whether you're talking about home or the classroom or anywhere
time for a recap anya
all right i'm feeling love let's do it
alright
here we go takeaway number one
we grown-ups seem to stop sending our kids mixed messages about kindness
yeah we say we want our kids to be kind but we have got to walk the walk
takeaway number two kids are born to be kind but also unkind
yeah so empathy is part of what makes us human but and this is a big but
there's a difference between feeling someone else's pain and actually acting to help
yeah kindness is not just a feeling it's an action
and that's why our takeaway number three is kindness requires courage
the courage to embrace other people's pain the courage to put other people's needs before your own
but also courage to see someone who's hurt you or a friend or someone in your family not as a bully
but as someone who's struggling
the kind of courage to see the world the way <unk> lewis does
there are only two kinds of people in the world good people and good people in pain
takeaway number four to build kindness practice mindfulness
being able to stay calm and patient will help you every time
especially when someone hurts you
so takeaway number five is apologies are a skill and forgiveness is a gift you give yourself
remember parents and teachers alike the old <unk> sorry it's not good enough
and when you're on the other side of the harm forgiveness may feel hard but it will also feel good in the long run
speaking of feeling good our takeaway number six is kindness grows with sunlight
or as jen at sesame says
we often are quick to tell children when they're doing something wrong and trying to correct them from doing something wrong
instead can we spend more time catching them doing something right catching them doing something kind
so create a culture of kindness and gratitude recognition of kindness in your home and in your classroom
and takeaway number six kindness takes practice
and grown-ups can help with that by creating opportunities for your kids to be kind
whether that's chores at home or family service projects out in the community

hello everyone and welcome to radio ombudsman in lockdown but the sun is shining outside my study window
our guest today is the first guest who carries the title president in his name and that is peter <unk> who is the world president of the international ombudsman institute
and the introductory music today has been composed produced and played by <unk> hamilton a talented young musician from north london
thank you <unk> i welcome feedback on our introductory music
and if any listener wants to use radio ombudsman as the showcase for their musical talent please let us know
peter <unk> is a big beast of the ombudsman world he's a <unk>
he's now ombudsman for ireland having recently been <unk> to serve a second term
he has a long association with wales where he occupied a variety of senior positions in housing and social care
he then became public service ombudsman for wales between two thousand eight and thirteen
he's been chairman of the british and irish ombudsman association for two years and currently he's the president of the world board of the international ombudsman institute for the last four years
peter you're extremely welcome thank you for being with us
thank you rob very glad to be here
peter um i'm very interested to hear a bit about your early life
where were you born and tell us a bit about the values that were instilled in you when you grew up
um thank you rob i was born in dublin i was born into a fairly ordinary working-class home
my dad was a um mechanic with the state transport company my mother was um as was the case with many in the day a housewife
we lived a very ordinary family life
i didn't enjoy school and i was taught by the christian brothers so i have some of my learning to thank them for
was ah i wouldn't say they contributed to a a very happy <unk> but the rest of my childhood was very enjoyable so
my mother would have been quite religious it was a very different ireland at the time
our house was busy there were often relatives or neighbours popping in for cups of tea
and so was a a pleasant place to grow up
so you had a community service background before going to work in local government is that's that's correct isn't it
yes so i i worked for the welsh housing agency when it was set up that was funding housing associations on special needs housing
but then i went to work for cardiff housing department
i was responsible for services like homelessness and sheltered housing for older people and so on
and also managed the gypsy sites in cardiff so very interesting job
but i gradually became more involved in mainstream housing through that
and then before you became welsh ombudsman you were you were chief executive of the arts council of wales was was that good fun
it was very good fun it was at a time shortly after the creation of the welsh assembly
the government in wales was interested in <unk> if you like doing things to bring people together and they saw the arts as a valuable way of doing that
from my perspective obviously i was also interested in community arts and arts outreach to people who were otherwise excluded
so it fitted very well for me i i never had any expertise in the arts but i greatly enjoyed it
and it was a very good time for the arts in wales
now i think you must be one of the very few people to have occupied national ombudsman jobs in more than one country
i don't know whether there's anyone else like you in that regard but what was it like moving from being ombudsman in wales to ombudsman in in ireland
it was interesting
i think the ombudsman in wales was a very significant player in the evolution of the <unk> administration in wales
um but particularly the work focused within the health sphere
and an awful lot of the complaints that we dealt with were to do with clinical judgement
so moving to ireland and firstly i found that i don't have jurisdiction over clinical judgement
but also i have jurisdiction over a much broader range of government services and local government
so was similar in some ways to wales but it was a a bigger job if you like
in the context of the a um whole national government and a different set of issues to deal with
in ireland you're also you wear many hats you're also the information commissioner
and you deal with local government ah standards as well
is is that do you find that an advantage in terms of being ombudsman
it's very helpful if you're committed to the same kinds of principles you're committed to good public services you're committed to openness you're committed to transparency
those values work across all of the different hats i wear
i suppose the biggest difference is as ombudsman you make recommendations but in ireland in the history of the office they've always been implemented
as information commissioner you make binding decisions but those get challenged in the courts
so despite what many people think to be the case being an ombudsman in some ways is more effective in terms of having outcomes achieved than having binding powers as information commissioner
what would you say have been the biggest challenges to you as irish ombudsman
you've obviously successfully dealt with them because you've been <unk> for a second term but looking back on the six years that you've had what what are the biggest challenges
the biggest challenge we faced was with the investigation into the <unk> <unk>
as we looked more closely at the issues there this was about women who had been held against their will
often young women who'd had babies sometimes <unk> who'd been held against their will and forced to work for many years in <unk>
what i was looking at was a government compensation scheme and the department of justice had chosen to interpret that scheme very narrowly
so they were excluding young women people who at the time were young women and had worked in the <unk> but been detained in industrial schools
which shared the same sites as the <unk> but not technically resident in the <unk>
so we looked at that and felt that there was a huge injustice but the initial response of the department was to reject our findings
so that required a <unk> campaign which ultimately led to the government changing its mind
to be fair i suspect if ministers had been involved from the outset i don't think that the rejection we initially saw would have happened
did any of the people who um experienced this detriment get in touch with you or was this the nature of you seeing the <unk> and acting on their behalf
no we had a small number of cases but we investigated the whole scheme and so some of the people who benefited wouldn't even have known of my office
so that's the advantage of having the power of own initiative to an ombudsman
ah yes it is you can investigate
even if you get complaints sometimes you're constrained because you can only investigate on the facts if you can't undertake <unk> investigations
if something comes up that needs to be looked at there's no constraints on me looking at that
and particularly i've found that ah in the context of excluded groups it's a very powerful tool to use to make sure that people who don't come to you can nonetheless have access to justice
yeah and is that regarded as controversial in ireland i wouldn't have thought so
no no it's just part of the ah toolkit available to the office i don't think anybody gives it any second thought
and you you behaved very bravely in in this investigation because at one point when you were being blocked by ministers you threatened to go to the
is that is that right
when i was being blocked by officials i went to the minister for justice and through him to the
the prime minister
i asked that they personally look to resolve the matter because it was such a a stark injustice some reflected very poorly on the government of ireland
gone the minister for justice both acted with great <unk> and the matter was resolved almost immediately following their intervention
i don't think you can be an effective ombudsman without having the kind of guts that you've shown throughout this
and the i hope you will <unk> with those <unk> that don't have <unk> powers because it seems to me to be a great hand
i don't think it is i mean even in a welsh context where i didn't have them at the time
you could be investigating something in one health board and see immediately that it was likely that the same problems were arising elsewhere
but technically you couldn't extend your investigation beyond the body you were investigating
that ability to extend an investigation to cover whichever bodies are involved is very powerful
so a lot of my work let's say with asylum seekers and refugees in accommodation provided on behalf of the government
and i will be looking at complaints that are to do with healthcare that are to do with access to benefits that are to do with all kinds of things access to housing
other than the services provided by the department of justice in providing the accommodation
so it is just that capacity to broaden out an investigation as well as the capacity to <unk> an investigation where you don't have complaints
now my current <unk> investigation is looking at the situation of people under <unk> living in nursing homes
that's become a much more pressing issue and the coronavirus crisis one of the people we've interviewed has already died another has contracted the virus
so although at this point it's not possible for obvious reasons to conclude the investigation
what we have done is written to the leaders of all the political parties who are currently involved and talks leading to the formation of a new government
to highlight the issue of people in institutional care so that at least what we've learnt to date in the course of our investigation can hopefully help to shape the policies of the incoming government
can we just move on a little bit
you you are the president of the international ombudsman institute which is a very important and prestigious job which is very valuable to <unk> all over the world
what added value do you think the i o i brings to to our discussions
well i think one the very important things is <unk> learning from each other
being an ombudsman is necessarily an isolated role what you can't do is be too close to the people in the services which are within your jurisdiction
so consequently we have more in common with each other than we do with the people whose services we're looking at and learning from each other is very important
the i o i provides structured training opportunities that's been one of the the very valuable things we've done
it provides best practice papers to show how things can best be done
and of course rob you yourself have been responsible for the best practice paper on on peer review and the work you've done in that field
and but also i think the i o i has played a big part in supporting ombudsman organisations under threat
we've seen for instance colleagues in many countries around the world who because they're doing their job are being threatened or ignored by their governments
and we've seen things like budgets being cut and we've seen people being denounced by government ministers and so on
so the solidarity of the international ombudsman community is very important but we also intervene quite directly
i give an example of um cyprus where the <unk> was looking to interfere in the work of the <unk> office
following intervention from the i o i and others with the government of cyprus and the parliament in particular the threats were withdrawn
and in poland the ombudsman was threatened with large cuts to his budget we sent in a commission of inquiry
we interviewed government ministers we interviewed the judiciary
and we carried out press conferences we talked to n g <unk> and we managed to get a stay of execution
and so we saw major threats to democracy there but our intervention along with those of others has helped to ensure that that office is still there and is continuing to operate effectively
that polish intervention was crucial
and what's one of the remarkable things about it was you actually went there didn't just talk about it
but you put the political institutions under pressure by asking them to give an account of what they were doing
absolutely so we did that in person and we did it through the media so that it had a very high profile within poland i think it's ah it's no good
i did the same in cyprus media interviews and talk to people on the ground
i think it's really important that solidarity is not something that comes just in the form of the letter though sometimes a letter can be effective enough in itself
but that you actually scale the intervention to the nature of the challenge
we we've talked about this quite a lot when we've not been on the radio but
how important do you think it is that we as <unk> do not get involved in political matters
or do you think this is a cultural relic of british imperialism
whatever about british imperialism no i think it's a very complex question
i think that for an ombudsman not to be involved in politics is scarcely possible because what we're actually doing is overseeing the services provided by the state
and so therefore any comment we make on those services has the potential to be political
what we can't be is party political and what we can't do is speak beyond the evidence of our <unk>
so i talked earlier on about seeking to um effect the formation of the government in ireland to to promote particular policies to favour disadvantaged groups of people
but i'm doing that on the basis of investigations i'm carrying out
i'm not doing it as peter <unk> citizen i'm doing it as ombudsman of ireland based on the evidence from my <unk>
and under those circumstances i think it's entirely appropriate to intervene
i think it becomes problematic if people are seen to be intervening on issues which go beyond their own work as ombudsman
i think that's where it would become problematic
but i do think that if you've got evidence that it's important that you use that evidence where it can be most effective in securing justice for the people who've come to you
so we're moving towards the end but i wanted to ask you about how you're coping with the coronavirus
what sort of impact has it had short term and longer term on on the way you operate
yes it's an interesting one
um the the first thing was that we surprised ourselves by being able to get ourselves in a position to work remotely much quicker than we might have done otherwise
i suppose if it's proved anything it's that when there is a crisis it's surprising how long-term problems can be solved in a hurry
and so we've been able to operate all of our services more or less without change throughout the crisis
we've had some changes in volumes of work coming to us
we've put a bit more emphasis on project work but by and large people are able to make their complaints to us
they can ring us they can email us
they can ah contact us on the web
um we're even able to collect our post though we're discouraging people from using the post at the moment but the effect of that is that we can keep going
the difficulties we face are probably more to do with the difficulties being faced by the services we're dealing with
so we've told the health service we've told nursing homes and we've told the department of social protection which deals with benefits and pensions
that we understand that it will take them longer to respond to us and that in some instances they won't be able to
so so we understand that and but in general we've been able to keep going
just give an example of the kind of things we've been dealing with
we had one gentleman stuck in poland who couldn't get back to ireland who'd been denied benefit in ireland even though his wife and children were in ireland and he normally lived and worked
and we were able to intervene successfully so that he got his benefits so we're able to deal with issues as they arise
i think in the longer term there'll be two things really one of them is just practical
we now know that it's possible for more of our people to work effectively from home and i can't see us going back to the situation before where only a very small number of people did that
i think more people will work from home as a consequence of what we've learnt during the crisis
but the second issue for me has been the appalling death toll among people in institutional care many of whom shouldn't be there
and i think we have to <unk> our efforts in working on their behalf after the crisis to make sure that should there be a resurgence or should something else like this come along
that they're not as exposed and as vulnerable as they are at the moment
it it makes complete sense for the ombudsman to be looking at both health and social care matters
and not as in this country to have a separation where one ombudsman looks at social care and the other looks at health
i i'll just if i may rob just add something
one the things that's noticeably different between ireland and the u k and england in particular is that there is a single national ombudsman in ireland
so that issues of health and social care can both come into my jurisdiction
the reality is these these are complex <unk> issues
i'm trying to deal with them with two separate ombudsman offices it's complicated enough as it is
trying to do so in the context where you have m p filters
where you have different systems applying in different parts of the u k is impossibly difficult for yourselves
but you manage it very well along with the local government ombudsman
and i have to say you've managed in practice to overcome the difficulties but it's also an impossibly complex scenario for <unk>
in ireland somebody wants to complain about public services they come to my office
in your case it's much more complicated
and i do hope that the proposals for ombudsman reform that we've seen in in the u k over recent years are not entirely lost
and that we do come to a much more satisfactory situation where there's a proper national ombudsman and where people can bring their complaints regardless of what particular public service they're complaining about
and i do hope that happens before i die which i'm increasingly becoming doubtful about but we'll we'll have to wait and see
peter you conducted the peer review of my organisation and then you appeared before the select committee in parliament
so that was not an expected development
ah what what was it like being being the peer reviewer who had to go before the u k parliament
it was an interesting experience robert
i think it would have been much more challenging if i hadn't been um quite so impressed by the quality of the service your office provides
it wasn't as though when we looked at the service we used a lot of objective criteria
and obviously ah with any office there is room for improvement but in general i was able to give reassurance to the committee as the quality of service that <unk> were receiving
but also to highlight some of the deficiencies in powers and in jurisdiction that are causing you difficulties in practice
but then i suppose what i'd want to say i was very impressed by the quality of the people in your office
and it was a very good experience they were very open with us
we talked to your staff without talking to yourself to the managers so we were able for people to express a view as they so fit and i think people were very complementary
so i think as i say it was an an interesting experience
it's always challenging to go before parliamentary committees and the session was quite searching
i think the committee wanted to reassure itself that this wasn't some kind of <unk>
but we were satisfied in the end that we were able to say no we've looked in detail at this office
there are areas which can improve but by and large this is an improving service that's delivering <unk> ombudsman service to the people of england and to the u k
well i think the structural point is that thanks to the i o i this this whole system of peer review looks like it has legs for the wider ombudsman community
and it is an effective and inexpensive way of adding to scrutiny of ombudsman schemes so thank you for the role that you played in pioneering that
one thing beyond that too rob is that ah
since the review was undertaken the i o i along with other bodies have worked quite hard
what the venice commission and the council of europe in developing a set of <unk> principles for ombudsman offices the venice principles as they've become known
and they've now been adopted by the council of europe
and that's the first time there's been a proper international standard against which <unk> offices can be judged
and so i'm keen to see them being used as they are being used now in the context of peer review
so that there is an objective set of internationally recognised standards against which you're measuring a particular ombudsman office
so i think that's again marks another step forward and one that i'm very pleased to have seen develop
i think when i undertook the peer review of the <unk> ombudsman with my belgian counterpart
we used those very same venice principles as the benchmark against which to judge the <unk> ombudsman
and it is very helpful to have that because it's without prejudice
it applies to everyone so i think it is an important development
so two final questions how have you peter <unk> reacted to working remotely being at home with your family
i've enjoyed it to be honest
it hasn't been too frustrating the technology can be an issue from time to time but it it hasn't been too difficult
it it's been less difficult than i would have expected
does time goes on i think the issue of visible leadership comes into it doesn't it
so you know you actually want to to be with your people again but but it works surprisingly well
and
as i say i think for the office itself i think we'll see more remote working in the future
thank you so lastly then it's what i always ask my guests
what advice would you give to young colleagues newly arriving as <unk> in the embryonic ombudsman profession
for me there is um there is a couple of characteristics that have to be embodied by people working in the service or as an ombudsman
we have to be objective we have to be fair
we have to be <unk> so the first advice often is make sure you know the whole story before you reach your conclusion
but <unk> all of that i would say that if you haven't got a passionate commitment to justice then you're in the wrong job
because what this fundamentally is about is people who believe in fairness people who believe in justice and people who want to use their own efforts to make sure that nobody is denied access to justice
and that's what we're here for
thank you so much peter
your answers were stimulating and also inspirational
we're all very grateful for the time you've given for this interview
thanks a lot
my next guest will be the <unk> ombudsman <unk> <unk>
so he'll be joining us from <unk>
in the meantime it's rob <unk> on behalf of radio ombudsman saying have a good day and stay safe
from the new york times magazine i'm <unk> <unk> this is sixteen nineteen
this week wesley morris on the birth of american music
so last fall i am at my friend's house we are making dinner i'm chopping vegetables and i asked my friend brett who was cooking with me can you put on some music
and he said what do you wanna listen to and i said have you ever heard of yacht rock and he said what i said yacht rock have you ever heard of this and he goes no i have not
so he finds the yacht rock station in pandora which i don't know why or how he's still a pandora guy with all due respect to pandora he is one and he finds the yacht rock station
at some point brett has to go run an errand i think i might have sent him on one i don't remember but he's gone so i'm alone just me with the vegetables and the yacht rock
it gives me plenty of time to really think about the songs i'm hearing
we're talking about music made between the years of i don't know i would say like nineteen seventy-five to about nineteen <unk> things like
<unk> how long
seals and <unk> to doing summer breeze i'm hearing things like
steal away by robbie <unk>
and the <unk> brothers what a fool believes
it is like our soft <unk> period in american popular music
the joke of yacht rock is that whoever invented it whoever's making a playlist out of these songs is basically saying that they're inconsequential and that what's in them doesn't matter
but what i know i'm hearing is something bigger and deeper than that
every song has something about it that is similar to the other songs
i'm hearing things like <unk> by <unk>
which seems perfectly <unk> has a really good beat sort of builds to its chorus
but then at the end
i'm hearing
the great <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and sixties
there is something jazz like in the <unk> music of something like <unk> dan
you can hear in somebody like michael mcdonald
that is like a gospel breakdown
what i'm hearing in all of these songs is basically blackness
and the song in which i am hearing it the deepest and strongest and most powerfully at least to me standing in that kitchen chopping those vegetables was when kenny <unk> this is it comes on
it's got a kind of loosely disco like rhythm to it there's a lot of <unk> sort of going back and forth and around
sure kenny <unk> is basically <unk> the verses in this song
doing this very light
cool
and then in the <unk> kenny <unk> disappears and who shows up michael mcdonald
giving kenny <unk> plenty of time to gather himself
when he sings the word miracle he doesn't sing miracle he goes miracle
like he is scraping the bottom of a pan to get all of the good bits off of it before you pour the gravy in
scraping the pan is the blackest thing you can do as a singer and here is kenny <unk> as this white artist doing it
and then the gravy comes
he is like at the top of the church at this point
he has elevated himself to the <unk> there's like no more he is like at the roof trying to clear a way to get to heaven but there's just church roof in the way
he's not the greatest singer but there's a kind of gumption and nerve to the singing of this song
that cannot be denied a tip of the hat to him
i just had to stand there and i just i i i actually cracked up i i just put down the knife and i cracked up and it felt so pleasurable and then i started thinking about all these other singers i love
i'm thinking about amy <unk>
i'm thinking about annie <unk>
i'm thinking about george michael
i think about chris <unk>
you practices this kind of <unk> blues that gets written off as country because he's a big white guy in a hat
and one of the many phases in which david bowie really wanted to make r and b and soul music
this is the sound not just of black america but the sound of america it is deeply american almost especially when it's sung by british people like david bowie and annie <unk> and amy <unk>
and it fills me with pride like i know that there is something irresistible and ultimately inevitable about black music being a part of american popular music
but it also reminds me that there's a history to this a very painful history and in the most <unk> ironic way it's this historical pain that is responsible for this music
some of the oldest recordings we have of black american music are from the nineteen thirties
and they're songs that would have been sung by americans born into slavery there's this one called old ship of zion
you can hear in it these four men their voices are moving in and out of each other
and it's beautiful and it's also sad you can feel that in your bones
and then there'll be music that was completely the opposite like old coon dog for instance
you can hear the <unk> in the song
and you've got this <unk> this great african instrument that becomes the bedrock of american music in so many ways and that thing is dancing
and then you have someone like billy <unk>
and oh my god you can hear in his singing what we would now call something like the <unk> day
years and years of hard work
and unimaginable sorrow
you can also hear in all of this music
this undeniable sound of hope
all of these melodies and cadences and emotions are things that wouldn't be passed down generation after generation it's what you would have heard on a plantation it's what you would have heard walking by a plantation
it's what you would have heard passing a black person doing his job entertaining himself doing the drudgery of work the way a guy named thomas dartmouth rice did sometime around the eighteen thirties
as the story goes t d rice a white man this anonymous nobody actor trying to make ends meet
one day he's touring with a <unk> in cincinnati or maybe it was pittsburgh we don't really know but the myth basically goes t d rice happened upon an old black man cleaning a horse in a stable
the man was doing his job on property owned by a white man named crow
he heard the tune this old black man was singing he saw the way this man moved his body as he was cleaning this horse
now we don't know what tune this old man would've been singing
whatever rice hears coming out of this man's mouth is <unk> to him and what he sees is an opportunity
because <unk> in the eighteen thirties looked like this
italian operas
british plays entertainment imported from europe all the people performing this stuff would have been white the audiences would have been white
after all it's eighteen thirty slavery is in full effect
and when it came to entertainment there was nothing new nothing truly american
and so when t d rice hears this black man singing this song and moving his body in this particular way ding a light bulb goes off
and he takes that light bulb and runs all the way to the theater he figures out a way to melt down some cork
let's it cool presumably takes a rag or maybe even his hand if it's cool enough
and then he paints his face black
he goes out on stage but instead of doing his regular act he's got this horse <unk> tune except now he's given the tune lyrics
come listen all you <unk> and boys i'm just from <unk> i'm going to sing a little song my name's jim crow
and the lyrics give the horse <unk> a name and the name is jim crow
so the crowd goes crazy they go so bananas the man gets twenty <unk>
this is the first time a paying audience is basically <unk> by a white man with a black face this is the night that jim crow was allegedly introduced to america this mascot of american racism
and this is what america really wanted which was its own original art form that is not an italian opera and isn't some british guy coming over and <unk> all over them
and here is thomas dartmouth rice giving it to them this is the night that american popular culture was born
oh boy i mean you know how it goes this sensational thing happens and then everybody wants to get on the <unk> and do their own
so you have other minstrel acts who come along and try to do what thomas dartmouth rice is doing a song and a dance
and a black face on their white skin
and then from these solo acts you have basically bands forming
and the bands have all the instruments that you would have in a band that you'd recognize now there is a <unk> and a fiddle and some <unk> and <unk> in the form of bones which would come from a pig sometimes
that is the formation of what will become the minstrel <unk>
and the place that <unk> took hold was in the north
places like philadelphia and new york and boston where you'd have these theaters dedicated to minstrel acts where minstrel acts would just move into a theater and do their act night after night after night after night after night
and a lot of these performers had never been <unk> south to have a meaningful relationship with black people and so they just made stuff up based on what they thought black people were like
they were able to draw on things that were coming to america from other parts of europe like the <unk>
and so you would had over the course of the formation of this culture an inherent mixing you had some amazing mix of an imagined blackness
real actual irish melodies and polish music with what we would now call gospel but spiritual <unk> <unk> together with this african <unk>
basically welding into a fusion that becomes the thing that everybody wants to try to do
the whole thing just sweeps the nation and for the rest of the nineteenth century this is the shit can we say that
and so for the rest of the nineteenth century this is the shit
this is america's primary form of entertainment people are going crazy for <unk> <unk> you have little boys going to bed and dreaming about how they can become part of this minstrel show
some of those people having these dreams go on to become people like stephen foster
stephen foster the man widely credited as being the father of american music
some of his songs some of his most famous songs songs you know songs you love songs you still sing songs your children if you have them they still sing some of those songs were written for <unk> performers
and if you listen to something like <unk> races you can hear in it all of its minstrel properties
the song of course is written in so-called negro dialect i mean instead of saying going you're saying <unk>
like instead of saying o f for of you get a lot of d e for de this is a white person imagining how a black person would sing this song
this is a white person imagining how a black person would sing this song
and that was a gold rush era hit
this is the i wanna hold your hand of eighteen <unk>
part of the problem that we still live with now is that it was so much the heart and soul of american culture that it wasn't that it became not racist
it just was a thing that you did if you wanted to be an <unk> at any point after eighteen thirty you in all likelihood were at least gonna try to be a <unk> minstrel even if you were black
after the civil war ends and there's an opportunity for black people to perform they have to do what the nation wants and what the nation wants at that point is <unk>
and now giving you noise in tempo
f e miller and <unk> <unk>
so black people blacked up and performed as black people who weren't actually black
by the time you have black people painting their faces black to perform as black people the only question you can really ask at this point is what the hell is going on why is this happening
what was so <unk> about seeing black people represented this way why would a white audience have <unk> for it so much i think one of the things that it offered was an opportunity to feel good about a thing that actually felt really bad at the time
people were really torn about whether to continue with slavery or whether to abolish it the minstrel show didn't really give you an answer
but it provided a platform by which you could either escape from actually having to think about that question that really was tearing the nation apart or depending on which show you would wind up seeing
it fully engaged you in the lightest possible way about enslaved people and how you didn't really have to feel so bad for them because they like being enslaved you got to laugh at a thing that you actually felt so <unk> about
you get to watch these black people who are really a source of national agony outside the theater become fools inside the theater and in sitting in that theater watching these white men in <unk> make fools of black people
a white audience could feel cultured they could feel civilized they could feel superior to the people they were watching be made fun of
and in a crazy way watching them <unk> would really have been an opportunity for a white audience to feel so much better about their own humanity
by the time you get to the twentieth century <unk> is still with us it is the basis upon which american movies are built this country's first movie blockbuster
d w <unk> the birth of a nation full of white men <unk> in <unk>
and america's first talking motion picture
the jazz singer about a jewish man who feels most himself not as a jewish man struggling with his jewish identity and pleasing his <unk> father no no
it's when he blacks his face up and performs mammy as a negro
some of <unk> favorite stars did numbers in <unk>
judy garland performed in <unk>
bing <unk> and fred <unk> both performed in <unk>
white christmas has a whole number most famous number in white christmas involves a <unk> tune
but at the same time there's the beginnings of a recording industry and you had black artists who had access to recording studios
out of these recordings you have people like muddy waters
inventing and perfecting blues rhythm blues ideas blues expression the expression of
of a fully human black self in american popular art
he had a kind of confidence that most people would never have heard coming from a black person before
and this is just the beginning
you have the advent of a place like blue note records where lots of amazing jazz was created and then released into the world people like sidney <unk>
and then louis armstrong
and duke <unk>
you have black musicians thinking about how to move not only music forward but american culture forward
thinking about how these instruments can do other things besides make what we think of as western european classical music
and taking music to a place that nobody had ever tried to previously take it
people who just kept pushing it forward and beyond
and then you have the development of the single most important movement black people have ever had <unk>
and that is the advent of motown records
motown is the most powerful <unk> expression of black glamour of black self-confidence of black <unk>
its project was to get black producers black musicians black singers to take quote white quote western musical ideas of orchestration strings and horns
and straightforward <unk>
and you marry them to a black weekend
where on saturday night you're at a <unk> joint having a good time with rhythm and blues music guitar and drum and bass
sex basically
and then you go home slightly hung over
and you wake up and you go to church on sunday morning
where there's a whole other musical experience involving hand <unk> and different <unk> arrangements and call and response
a lot of feeling a lot of <unk> a lot of gratitude
you have the combination of these three different areas of musical expression happening at the same time in just about every single motown record
or whether it's the four tops doing reach out i'll be there
or martha and the <unk> doing heat wave
on something like heat wave you can hear hands slapping the <unk> like it actually is sunday morning
then when everything is firing
it's just the most exciting romantic sound you're you're ever gonna hear and at the center of it is what can only be described as a <unk> <unk> blackness
here you have in motown a force that is actively combating these ideas of black people as being inherently inferior
motown is the antidote to american <unk>
and this is what i was thinking about standing there in that kitchen chopping those vegetables it's the thing that made me laugh was just how all that history
is just very silently <unk> through this music it might not even be aware that it's even there it's so thoroughly <unk> into american culture it's gonna show up in a way that even people making the art can't quite put their finger on
what you're hearing in black music that's so appealing to so many people of all races across time is possibility struggle it is strife it is humor
it is sex it is confidence and that's ironic because this is the sound of a people who for decades and centuries have been denied freedom
and yet what you respond to in black music is the ultimate expression of a belief in that freedom the belief that the struggle is worth it that the pain <unk> joy
and that that joy you're experiencing is not only contagious it's necessary and urgent and irresistible black music is american music
because as americans we say we believe in freedom and that's what we tell the world and the power of black music is that it's the ultimate expression of that belief in the american freedom
when andy griffith passed away in twenty twelve c n n covered his death off and on the entire day
you've all seen this type of news coverage before an overview of the career images of the star in their prime phone in conversations with other celebrities who were close with the departed
larry king is one of the people who called in to talk that day he'd had andy on his various shows numerous times and he mentioned something in passing that's really interesting
what larry said is that a lawyer named percy foreman was the man who inspired the character <unk>
this was a weird thing for anyone to say because most people even today believe that character to be based on a different lawyer named bobby lee cook
however in twenty fifteen three years after larry king said something that most people would assume was incorrect the creator of <unk> did confirm that the character was based on percy foreman
a criminal defense attorney from houston texas who lost only <unk> of the fifteen hundred cases where clients of his faced the death penalty with only one of those losses resulting in an actual execution
percy was able to achieve this record by being an incredible lawyer no denying it but also due to the texas court system's practice of using juries to determine guilt as well as sentencing in the case of a guilty verdict
so instead of one judge who's heard it all before determining his client's fate
percy had twelve average citizens from the local community sitting right there waiting to be convinced that the victim in this situation wasn't a victim at all
they were up to no good the community was far better off without that element in it and even if his client had killed them well hell they hated killing
foreman called it misdemeanor murder that's where a jury might convict you of ending another person's life and send you on your way with the type of punishment you'd receive for a misdemeanor crime
often nothing more than probation no time at all it's essentially a sanctioned form of <unk> justice
percy foreman had such a long run of wins with this strategy that it's still being used in texas today people who have conversations about this sort of thing will sometimes refer to it as the texas defense
now jim denny wasn't from texas he was from tennessee
the buffalo valley area about sixty miles east of nashville was a real poor area to be born in nineteen eleven
when a sixteen year old jim denny got hired to work the <unk> of w s m radio's parent company he must have seen it as an opportunity to make something out of himself
denny got this job in nineteen <unk> that year the young radio program w s m barn dance was referred to as the grand ole <unk> for the first time on air
every time an odd job came up at the <unk> jim would take it so he could hang out backstage see the artists and see how the show was made
within twenty years denny had worked his way up to director of the artists service bureau at w s m which meant he was in charge of booking the acts on the <unk>
there's a few funny things from jim <unk> time at the grand ole <unk> like the one about elvis <unk> big debut
elvis was still a teenager when denny did sam phillips the favor of letting elvis come on the show to play his <unk> arrangement of blue moon of kentucky
it didn't go well denny is rumored who have told elvis backstage you ain't going nowhere son you ought to go back to driving a truck
<unk> also the guy who fired hank williams over the telephone and there's the time when jim made johnny cash wait outside his office for two hours before letting him in to ask why cash should be allowed to play on the <unk>
cash mentioned that he presently had a song called i walk the line in the top ten
jim denny was what many people referred to in those times as a hard man today i think they'd have some different words for him and that's why ernest <unk> tried to shoot him in nineteen <unk>
you are listening to cocaine and <unk> the podcast about twenty century country music and the lives of those who give it to us
my name is tyler <unk> <unk> i heard the stories my whole life
as far as i can tell here is the truth about this one
it's shocking to hear ernest <unk> name associated with any kind of violence whatsoever
there are plenty of stories about him but most of them are about how great a guy he was he had an adorable nickname e t you can hear admiration in the voice of everyone who calls him that
crisp texas is a ghost town now ernest <unk> was born there in nineteen fourteen into a family of <unk> like most <unk> children ernest grew up working on farms all over the area
long days in the field entertainment from a stereo in the evenings an early bedtime and you get back up the next day to do it all over again typical day for a <unk>
like a great number of artists we'll learn about in future episodes it was all over for a <unk> ernest <unk> the first time he heard jimmie <unk> sing
the obsession with instant and it would steer the course of the rest of his life
hearing jimmie <unk> is what led ernest <unk> to decide he simply had to become a country singer
it's also very specifically what caused him three decades later to want to shoot a three <unk> magnum at jim denny
in nineteen <unk> jimmie <unk> died young of tuberculosis symptoms he was thirty-five
the death of his idol was extremely upsetting for ernest however it also made him realize that he was going to have to get serious about chasing his dreams
he moved to san antonio made a few guest appearances on a friend's radio show and managed to secure his own early morning show which aired twice a week not bad for a <unk> kid
but don't get the wrong idea he was nowhere near the big time and the pay was quite slim
e t had to keep two other jobs besides the radio gig some days he was a ditch <unk> in other days a drug store clerk
holding down three jobs at once was necessary to support himself and his young wife elaine they didn't waste any time before starting to have kids either
ernest was more than happy to work hard if it kept him moving toward the life of his hero jimmie <unk>
he'd had this small picture of jimmie for years now and it was in pretty bad shape so he got a phone book and looked up the number for jimmie <unk> widow carrie
he called her on the phone to explain that he was such a big fan and to see if she happened to have a bigger better photo of jimmie that ernest could have maybe even one that was <unk>
carrie was super nice and she did have such a photo that ernest could have and went so far as to invite him out to her house in <unk> texas to get the picture
ernest drove out there the next sunday he wasn't working taking elaine and their baby justin on the trip
they'd planned to stay for maybe ten minutes and ended up hanging out for over two hours looking at costumes guitars and pictures brought out by mrs <unk> hearing her stories about how high on the hog they'd lived merely a few years earlier
e t could never have guessed when he woke up that morning that he'd be laying down to sleep that night having held jimmie <unk> signature martin acoustic guitar with <unk> name <unk> in pearl across the <unk> and the word thanks written on the back upside down
so he could flip it over to show audiences
choose your biggest dead hero and try to think of how you'd feel if a similar experience happened to you it's mind blowing
okay now add this on top of that a few months later carrie <unk> called ernest to say she'd listened for his radio show as he'd asked for her to do
on one hand she offered to help e t out with the access she still had to music business big shots
on the other hand she didn't think he sounded like jimmie <unk> when he sang which is basically the only thing in the world ernest <unk> wanted to do in this phase of his life
and everyone around him had told him that's exactly what he'd been doing the whole time
anyway she still hooked e t up with elsie <unk> the writer of a few great jimmie <unk> songs
ernest <unk> made a couple of records that didn't sell very well did some touring and ended up back home doing low paying radio again and working two or three side jobs like before driving around a beer truck was one of them
after a while back at home ernest had to have his <unk> taken out he'd later say the doctors told him not to sing or <unk> for a while after the surgery but he didn't listen
jumping right back into his normal routine <unk> his throat
it changed his voice forever
ernest held a self <unk> sense of humor about his own voice for the rest of his life he loved to say that nine out of ten guys sitting in bars around the country could sing better than he could
i don't know if he really believed that it's always been strange to me i think george jones <unk> the greatest country singer in history is exactly what happens when you add ernest <unk> new singing style and roy <unk> voice together
you just heard some ernest here's a little roy <unk> from nineteen <unk>
now george <unk> would have told you hank williams was his favorite singer you don't get hank without ernest and roy i've seen <unk> <unk> named as an influence on george
<unk> borrowed from ernest as well however you want to say we got to george jones it always comes back to roy <unk> and ernest <unk>
now the part of ernest you can hear in george is the tendency to hold on to a note for longer than you'd expect picking the melody up and putting it back down in ways that are impossible to predict when hearing them sing a song for the first time
no matter if it's a song you've heard performed by other people
here's georgia in nineteen <unk> doing his own composition just one more
both versions of this song are great
it's possible ernest really didn't like his new voice about a million people disagree with his opinion he had that <unk> in nineteen <unk>
in nineteen forty he had his biggest hit walking the floor over you this song is still synonymous with the name ernest <unk>
if someone only knows one ernest <unk> song it's usually this song
we like introduce a man who has become a legend in his own time
e t was finally big time
the texas <unk> ernest <unk>
he joined the grand ole <unk> in nineteen <unk> and formed the first incarnation of the texas <unk>
<unk> would stay working for the rest of his life so members of the texas <unk> would be replaced every now and then
buddy <unk> jack greene billy <unk> leon rhodes and cal smith are only some of the notable players who joined the band on their way up the ladder
this was the first way ernest found to extend a helping hand to younger musicians like the hand carrie <unk> had held out to him
your dad made all those guys household name
yes he did
just <unk>
he was the first one ah to call names out on records and he loved doing that he loved the guys and they were a big part of his show i mean ah and he wanted to make sure they got the credit for it
and so he started calling their names out when they get took a course but he was never jealous of anybody in his band <unk> him you did you know he didn't mind that at all as he proved with jack greene and cal smith and
ah and because he had the <unk> with him for a while and <unk> worked some dates with him george jones stonewall jackson and he was always pushing them and he like roy i think understood that the bigger they became the bigger he became
george jones and stonewall jackson were never texas <unk> justin meant e t took those guys out on tour with him as opening acts to help them build their own following and often he did a lot more than that
yeah ah i i don't have many but but i have one ernest
johnny paid check
ah ernest one time i was hanging around the streets and it was snowing and buddy <unk> took me on to meet him he always wants me to meet him
and i had met him but i mean i wanted to sit and talk with him maybe get ready to go on tour and i didn't have anywhere to stay you know i was at that stage in my life
and evidently buddy had told him that
the <unk> said we got on and he said i talked for a while and i was you know and he said well it's about time to leave he said yeah
he said you working as we follows to work and i said no he said you are now he was going on like ten days out in texas and it was snowing here in nashville and i had nowhere to you know i just i was in my in in that place where i always you know
he took me on the road wound up giving me a suit i didn't have nothing to wear so he gave me one of his old suits and took it to the cleaners and i had it cut down the first date we got in texas
and it was so ah there was two pockets in the back that's how much they had to take up but i it was a and and i still got a picture of me in in in in that suit
and i i he let me go out and i opened his show for him for ten days and he fed me and at the end of the tour gave me some money so that's the kinda guy he was
you can't tell the hank snow story without talking about ernest <unk> e t told johnny cash not to smile when he performed <unk> prison blues so people in the audience could really feel the song
cash never forgot the advice hank williams senior was heavily influenced by <unk> music and ernest is the one who convinced the grand ole <unk> to bring hank back after his first failed audition
e t got hank to promise he wouldn't touch any booze for three months to swing that one
in nineteen <unk> enough radio listeners wrote letters complaining of not being able to find his music that he launched the ernest <unk> record shop in nashville if you couldn't make it there in person they'd ship records directly to you
it was a game changer for country music fans and would help keep the music alive when rock and roll <unk> america in the <unk>
the record shop operated at a loss of ten thousand dollars a year for the first two years it was open but ernest knew how important it was and he kept it alive
the <unk> was a great promotional tool for him and he'd started his own show on w s m in the following time slot when the <unk> was over fans could stay tuned in for the <unk> <unk>
ernest played host to <unk> stars and newcomers alike making sure to remind you this music was available for mail order from ernest <unk> record shop he took the chance to keep jimmie <unk> memory alive pitching his records as well
ernest never grew out of his fascination with jimmie <unk> and never stopped <unk> his debt to <unk> widow carrie <unk> death had left carrie in a pretty bad financial situation but she still got money from the sales of his records which were declining
he realized the more jimmie <unk> records sold the better off carrie would be so e t pushed those records as hard as he could
carrie loaned and eventually flat out gave him that guitar of <unk> which is why you'll frequently see pictures or videos of ernest <unk> playing a guitar that says jimmie <unk> on it
in nineteen <unk> ernest helped found the jimmie <unk> memorial festival in <unk> hometown of meridian mississippi that's a stand-up guy
you can find plenty of people who'll say the same thing about jim denny
remember jim poor kid from tennessee worked his way up from the <unk> to become director of artists services at w s m and manager of the grand ole <unk>
director of artists services was a fancy way of saying he booked the musical acts that played on the radio station as well as the <unk>
denny was a powerful man in nashville and he acted like he knew it
where ernest <unk> built a reputation for helping young musicians jim denny had a reputation for acting like a dick
the johnny cash e t gave advice to is the same johnny cash who had to wait two hours outside <unk> office
jim denny might not have been a dick he could have simply been a businessman who paid more attention to the bottom line than how many friends he had
<unk> the guy who had to be convinced to let hank senior onto the <unk> and he's the guy who called hank to fire him over the telephone but ernest <unk> was standing in <unk> office when that phone call was made
he said he saw tears in jim's eyes
hank had missed a scheduled <unk> appearance most likely for no good reason other than that he was drunk denny said he thought firing hank would make him realize he needed to get his act together
that's not what happened hank williams died four months after being dismissed from the <unk> it's tragic but you can see how jim denny thought he was doing the right thing in that situation
this is important to recognize because the year hank williams died is the same year that jim denny formed <unk> publishing with webb pierce
if you don't know what a publishing company is it used to be the heart of the record industry on the surface a publishing company's purpose was to make sure sales <unk> were going to the right place
they took a big percentage to do this so anything that could be done to make a hit out of one of their writer's songs they'd do it and if they forgot to send you your whole royalty check sometimes well shit happens
roy <unk> and fred rose had started <unk> music back in nineteen <unk>
so many country writers were being screwed over by publishing companies based out of other cities that they needed to be one in nashville an honest publishing company run by country artists for country artists
they were the best game in town until jim denny formed <unk> in <unk>
as head of artists services at w s m and manager of the grand ole <unk> jim denny controlled who got to play on the <unk> their place in the lineup and how long they got to play
can you see where this is headed
if jim denny owns a country music publishing firm while retaining singular control of the most popular country music radio program in america then he's essentially printing his own money
once he's got a writer signed to <unk> then he's getting a huge piece of any money their songs make if that writer also wants to be a performer congratulations you're on the <unk> tonight
if the writer doesn't want to be a performer congratulations webb pierce is the biggest star on the <unk> and he's playing your song on the grand ole <unk> tonight
roy <unk> was pissed off and he didn't stay quiet about it he said denny was giving the best bounce to his own artist artists signed to <unk> rose had a tendency to see roy's point
artists signed to <unk> had a tendency to think jim denny wasn't doing anything wrong weird huh
long story short in nineteen <unk> w s m fired jim denny over his conflicts of interest
he started a booking agency and signed most of the <unk> artists some of whom had resigned when denny was fired then denny contacted the philip morris tobacco company
their competition in the cigarette business r j reynolds was a sponsor of the grand ole <unk>
so when jim denny called with a chance for them to get their product associated with all those acts philip morris wrote a check big enough to fund the biggest country music package tour anyone had ever seen
half the <unk> <unk> lineup these fans listened to every saturday night was coming to stages across america for live appearances
with philip morris paying for everything the admission was even free
it looked as though everyone was getting what they wanted until the philip morris country music show booked a stop in meridian mississippi on the same week as the fifth annual jimmie <unk> memorial festival
but it was worse the philip morris show would take place on the second night of the two-day jimmie <unk> festival
for five years ernest <unk> had worked to grow the jimmie <unk> festival from scratch this is a tremendously difficult thing to do e t put in the effort to honor his idol
jim denny wasn't simply setting up shop across the street with some healthy competition
he brought a free show to town on the same night with half the grand ole <unk> lineup and several big names you would have had to buy a ticket to see on the jimmie <unk> event the previous night
it's hard not to see that as a giant middle finger can you imagine what would happen if <unk> set up a festival eight miles away from <unk> on the same weekend for free
it would crush <unk> this was such a big deal that they didn't even have the jimmie <unk> memorial festival the following year
they <unk> to put one on again in nineteen <unk> but carrie <unk> health had already taken a turn for the worse and ernest <unk> was never involved with the festival again
mostly a kind man e t was different when he'd been drinking a beer or two while gambling with the guys he'd be fine but it was the times when he'd get drinking for a whole day or two or five
mirrors would get smashed windows broken he had a thing about glass apparently
according to billy <unk> ernest <unk> reaction to the philip morris country music show <unk> the jimmie <unk> memorial festival was to get drunk and stay drunk for the better part of a week
they <unk> him back to nashville but he was still drinking and he was still mad as hell at jim denny
finally he called denny at home in the middle of the night to cuss him out denny said something like well if you're so mad about it then how about you just meet me down at w s m right now and we'll settle things for good
that sounded like a great plan to ernest <unk> he strapped on a gun belt with bullets and three hundred <unk> magnum in the holster and drove downtown in his <unk> wearing house slippers
meanwhile when jim denny had hung up the phone he simply took it back off the hook again so ernest couldn't call him anymore and then went back to sleep
so ernest <unk> is drunk off his ass with a loaded gun when he stumbles into the lobby of the national life building where w s m was located
it's close to five thirty in the morning people are starting to show up for work
there's more than one version of what happened next the gun gets fired in all of them
bill williams the news director at w s m says he was walking in to work when a gunshot rang out in the lobby and a bullet went over his head into the wall
he turned around you know pretty scared and saw ernest <unk> standing there in his house slippers with a revolver
when he asked ernest what the hell he was doing ernest said my god i've shot the wrong man
whether or not he'd been actively trying to kill anyone we will never know for certain it seems to me like he thought he had successfully shot someone and was only upset that someone wasn't jim denny
either way ernest settled down after thinking he'd shot an innocent person bill williams called his boss jack <unk> to tell him what happened jack told bill to take ernest home
he would have except the police had been called as soon as other employees heard a gunshot in the office building
ernest <unk> went to jail for drunk and <unk> plus carrying the weapon
it was mandatory to hold public intoxication <unk> for three hours
so ernest bought cigarettes for all the other inmates and sang songs with them while bill williams waited to take him home
sixty dollars bond got him out and that was the end of that
jim <unk> name was kept out of the papers though everyone in the business could read between the lines and see who ernest had wanted to shoot
the incident seems to have had no effect on <unk> career whatsoever apparently if all e t was trying to do was put a bullet in jim denny then that was fine
his career lasted into the <unk> he was still doing over two hundred dates on the road a year and he only quit in nineteen <unk> because of problems from his <unk>
in nineteen <unk> his lungs killed him just like his hero jimmie <unk>
the <unk> <unk> still airs every saturday night and you can still buy music from ernest <unk> record shop or online at e t record shop dot com
we're told that in nineteen <unk> ernest <unk> made up with jim denny before jim passed away from cancer the jim denny artist bureau stayed in business for only a few more years
jim denny was <unk> to the country music hall of fame in nineteen <unk> <unk> jim <unk> publishing company was sold to mel <unk> in nineteen <unk>
ernest <unk> had been <unk> to the country music hall of fame in nineteen <unk> while he was still alive
thank you for listening to the first episode of cocaine and <unk> i hope you like it and i promise i'll get a lot better at doing this
wherever do you listen to this it would be huge for me if you could share this episode with just one person if you're listening on itunes or stitcher that i'm told that getting reviews is really important so i guess please give me a review
ah be nice every episode of cocaine and <unk> is written and produced by me tyler <unk> <unk>
each episode also has a companion blog post at cocaine and <unk> dot com go check that out for links to the books i read the video clips i watched and the music i talked about in the episode
before i get to the liner notes segment of the post show you can email any questions you have about this episode or the podcast or me or life in general to questions at cocaine and <unk> dot com
if enough people send in questions then i'll make a q and a episode to close out the first season alright liner notes
okay first of all if i didn't make it clear it is impossible to <unk> ernest <unk> importance to country music
aside from influencing basically everyone who matters he was one of the first if not in fact the first artist to bring an electric guitar player with him on to the grand ole <unk> stage
if you want to call it a <unk> <unk> and it happened after ernest <unk> it was influenced by ernest <unk> before i get to the story and episode i'd like to address one other thing
in the <unk> <unk> moody try to start an alternative association to the country music hall of fame called the country music pioneer association
the c m p a had a <unk> newspaper that <unk> essentially used to rant against the industry and print whatever shitty rumors people sent in
among these rumors was one that ernest <unk> died broke and alone in a cheap downtown motel shunned by the country music world he done so much to help
this rumor is still spread as fact and i do not believe it's true
charlie <unk> even has it in his autobiography which isn't the only thing charlie got wrong in that book but i'll talk about that another time
first of all the source was ernest <unk> estranged wife next ernest died owning seventy percent of the ernest <unk> record shop which had multiple locations running and was very profitable at that time he was not a broke man
it's just that's not realistic
i believe ernest chose to turn visitors away because he was wasting away is <unk> and didn't want anyone who loved him to have that as their last memory of him
i don't remember who it was but someone actually did get in to see him and they point blank said they wish they had not gone to see him
they could tell he was uncomfortable about it and they were uncomfortable about it and they don't like having that be their last memory of him so he was trying to avoid that
and i think justin said that people would go will try to see earnest and he would tell justin to tell them thank you but he'd rather not have the company
so you know i mean the end i i don't think that ernest <unk> died you know and it's sad state of affairs i think that he did
i think he did a lot for the country music and i think he went out of way that he wanted to go at it seems like to me okay back to ernest <unk> and jim denny
what what about this story right is was that crazy um it's just so many things like the the roots of country music are just growing all over this story you know you got jim denny showing up right as the grand ole <unk> is becoming a thing
ernest <unk> gets in there and his throat is broken so he can't do what he wanted to do is whole life which is imitate his hero
and his throat gets broken and so now he's got a create this new thing and he ends up influencing fucking hank williams senior and like everyone that is that's crazy it's amazing i love the story
um i i won't even try to pretend to remember the first time i heard this story it it gets around you know ah
at least the part about ernest <unk> getting drunk and going down to the radio station with a gun and shooting them firing off around to the wall you know
if people always bring that up as an example of how wild and crazy these old guys were everybody laughs about ernest getting hauled off to jail and ultimately getting away with causing a little bit of trouble you know um boys will be boys
and nobody ever seemed to know why it happened and that's all i ever really wanted to know people will tell you the story just like what why did he do that but i don't know who cares it's just funny like well i wanted to know so i found out ah
thanks to ronnie <unk> very well done biography on ernest <unk> ah that finally had the story for me and the big jimmie <unk> festival thing why that affect it early so deeply that was in there
um the most detailed account of bill william's version of the lobby shooting was in there
um i went with bills version because a he was the news director of w s n with a reputation for being able to throw away that day's new script and add lib the news without making a mistake
and b he was the one right in the middle of it you know he called his boss at home he went with ernest to the jail a shout out jim <unk> um everyone else just seemed like a <unk> trying to get their name involved you know
like a security guard saying that he told the ernest to put the gun away and ernest fired at off to dare the security guard or whatever you know i mean
no offense if your security guard but i've hung out with a lot of security cards and you all are full of shit so i'm going with the news director guy
also i'm aware there are you know different <unk> history type opinions about how well elvis <unk> debut on the grand ole <unk> did or didn't go
my thing is um he didn't get an encore you know that is a fact he didn't get encore he was a special gust and special guests almost always get an encore so the fact that he didn't get one
i'm going with it wasn't good you know i don't think it i don't think it was good you know
ah i've seen every year from nineteen twenty-four to nineteen <unk> cited as the year of danny being hired at the parent company of w s m that insurance company the life insurance company ah i don't really care what year he you know exactly was a see
there was a biography of johnny cash that quoted a rolling stone interview with johnny talking about jim denny making him wait outside his office for two hours
ah <unk> jordan biography on jim reeves had a bunch of great information on the jim dandy <unk> scandal i found a billboard magazine from nineteen <unk> reporting that philip morris paid over four hundred thousand dollars for the talent on that first package tour
that is a mind-boggling number nineteen <unk> four hundred thousand dollars
for probably ah i don't know eight ten probably ten acts on the bill that's just that's bananas
ah i'm gonna say this guy's last name wrong craig <unk> <unk> harvey <unk> i don't know he wrote a book on the history of w s m called
called air castle it's a really good book it's just a mess of subject you know the history of w s n there's so much there
i know i'm gonna keep coming back to this book for future episodes a lot of when i got out of that for this was about <unk> firing because pretty much everywhere else you hear people talk about denny getting fired
they're all like yeah i don't know it was just like weird no one really knows why he got fired or you got artists who were with cedar wood saying jim dandy got <unk>
you've got artists who were with a cuff rose and denny was corrupted and he had to get out of there you know so this w s m book was really good just to find out straight up what happened
i mentioned that hank senior was heavily influenced by ernest <unk> but also some of the most charming stuff i ever read about hank is the way he acted around ernest
you know they were peers they were contemporaries it hank was influenced by him but then he you know got to come to the show
and be a part of the big time and you just get the idea that you were just like a kid in a candy store around ernest <unk> you get ah the idea that you just really love being around this guy and you couldn't help messing with him he's always screwing with ernest
ah ernest <unk> song walking the floor over you hank williams took that image of walking the floor and put it in your <unk> heart you know you'll walk the floor like i do
ah and he he had a monster head with it and he just couldn't he couldn't leave ernest alone about it you know just like hey ernest we think about that i stole that stole that image yeah i got your image boy like just like kind of shit
that clip of justin <unk> talking and the clip of johnny paycheck talking are both from the country family <unk> d v ds which are pretty much all amazing if you've never seen those
ah i think it's bill anderson that hose them there's gotta be twenty of them in a siri they always got different old school people on their sitting around talking telling stories
just i mean if you see one ah any of the ones with grandpa jones any of the ones with grandpa jones or little jimmy dickens on them are fucking hilarious you've gotta see them um just
just clown just everyone just <unk> on each other and we are talking like people old enough to be your grandparents just <unk> on each other a harder than you ever did in college that's great
ah there's a book called andy and don with the confirmation of percy foreman inspiring <unk>
percy is no longer alive and his new york times obituary had some other interesting information that i did not know
ah like jack ruby ask percy foreman to defend him after shooting lee harvey oswald but then there was this communication error like ah
jack ruby's people told jack that informant want it like five times as much money as he could ever ask for anyone or something so he was like well screw that i get someone else
ah and informant like seem disappointed that he didn't get that case so i guess he wanted that but informant did represent martin luther king juniors assassin james earl ray
but only long enough to convince him to plead guilty so yeah james did not get away with that ah
oh yeah the <unk> defense thing um i have spent a lot of time in texas and this defense thing is so effective there
that i went into this episode with the understanding that that was actually a lot like that's a statute on the books in texas
ah people who lived in texas their whole life believe they live in a state with a law called that he needed killing law and i know that because these people have told me that
and yeah i i always just thought it was a law in texas like you can straight up murder a mother <unk> if they deserve it you know if they've got coming
you shoot them they're dead he needed kill in this is still the wild west don't mess with texas
ah it was only after uncovering the percy foreman <unk> connection that i learned that it was really just a legal defense strategy that works so incredibly well there it may as well be a law
it's pretty intense
ah i think that's it oh um next week if you're listening to this early i'm just putting us up on the website and if you happen to listen to it early
then next week i'm going to be talking about <unk> lynn song the pill it's about the birth control pill and it was banned from radio and i was looking into why and ah i found out a lot of really really interesting stuff you know thing
the kind of stuff the you know everyone no one could be really surprised by but when you hear the actual numbers on these stats
it's ah it's crazy it's really crazy um definitely come back next week <unk> lynn the pill
see you there
hello everyone i'm stephen west this is <unk> this thank you to everyone that supports the show on patron and thank you to the people that don't support the show by going through the amazon banner you find out more about both those things on the front page of <unk> this dot org
apologies for the voice and my lack of execution today um just getting over a cold i i but had been too long since i <unk> you with my voice and i want to give you guys this today's episode is part six in a series on <unk> and <unk> i hope you love the show today
so in a culture where there's so much social currency connected to being a victim and i having some burden that you carry around with you throughout your life there maybe some you out there that feel a little left out while that maybe you're the kind of person you look at yourself you don't feel like a victim
maybe you don't sit around poised waiting to make other people aware of some bad thing that happened to you in the past well enough of that crazy talk get off the bench cause your uncle steve's putting you in the game i'm here to tell you don't worry my friend you are a victim you really are
turns out we're all victims just by virtue of being born because just think for a second about how horrible the world was for us when we were all babies think of what it's like being a baby
imagine going through something similar today and if you made it on the other side tell me you wouldn't be part of some sort of advocacy group for the people that are currently going through it think about it you didn't choose to be born imagine being rounded up against your will and being <unk> off to some alien planet you know nothing about
you find yourself once you get on that planet absorbed into some foreign tribe you don't speak the language you have no idea what anything is you you think the remote control to their t v is food you're completely defenseless and who do you have as teachers on this journey
what just some random man and woman that happen to look like you didn't go to school for this stuff being a baby being a baby is like going to the world's worst community college or they don't even have teachers they just pull some random people off the street and say ah teach these kids about rocket science go
except it's worse than that we're not just learning about rocket science we're learning everything about what it is to exist how we look at other people how we look at the world how we look at ourselves within that world what i'm saying is the struggle for us former babies out here was real
and i think it's safe to say that when you're living in the middle of this chaotic world as a baby just try to figure things out no one's really blaming you for just sort of going along with a lot of the ways people were doing things around you
there's a lot to figure out and a lot of these ways we've learned to make sense of stuff are totally arbitrary a lot of the ways we think about stuff have just been sort of almost by accident passed down from generation to generation philosophers realized this
and at the time of <unk> for over three hundred years people had been pointing out how many of the ways we look at things in the western world are largely derivative from the way christianity describes being a human being
that's how entrenched religion was in the lives of people back then and that even if you've never been to church even if your family's fifteen generations removed from ever having stepped foot in a church some of these things are so foundational that generation after generation of confused baby try to figure things out
just went along with certain assumptions about existence that have their origins in christianity for example ah there's a certain <unk> way that a lot of people look at important crossroads in life right like for example they'll say
okay so i need to choose a career path for my life i need to declare a major big decision what do i do well whenever i close my eyes and think about what i want i honestly don't know what i want i can't make that big of a decision yeah i've narrowed it down to a few things
but how can i ever know
i can spend hours a day thinking about this stuff i have faith it's gonna come to me some day i have faith that i'm gonna wake up one day <unk> gonna happen to me some life event is going to occur
i'm gonna realize my calling in life in that moment people do this same thing with relationships they'll say i have this vague idea up in my head of my one and only someone don't know exactly what they look like don't know exactly what they're gonna be like but i'm confident one day i'm gonna meet someone
and there's gonna be this moment when i look at them and i realize they're the person i wanna spend the rest of my life with people do this with anything they they'll do it with motivational videos on youtube one day i'm gonna watch the right person screaming at me to be a better person
and from then on out it's gonna be easy for me to go to the gym and eat pine cones for the rest of my life in other words there's a certain <unk> way that some people look at life choices that some thinkers believe is a long lost relic of the <unk> way we used to think about the nature of existence
that a reasonable expectation to have when navigating your life is that one day you're gonna wake up and there's gonna be some event some miracle that you witness some transcendent moment where you realize the divinity of jesus
if you have any further questions about the nature of existence just you know forward them to the pope's inbox that's a reasonable thing to expect in that worldview well this isn't the only example of these long lost remnants of christianity in our thinking
and another major one another one that a lot of people in today's world still use to make sense of things is the way that they look at themselves and who they are just like in christianity where yes you have a body but your true self is a soul
it's an eternal spirit hidden deep down within that body that you have an intimate access to just like that a lot of people in today's world think of their true self or the answer to the question who are you as a personality hidden deep within us that only we and our closest friends have access to
you know they'll say things like sure when i'm out in public i do kind of put on a mask to other people for the sake of social utility i mean i don't act like my one hundred percent true self in the starbucks drive <unk>
yeah i tell people things they want to hear i play the game because look the fact is it's just not useful too
not to mention i don't really feel comfortable giving a hundred percent of my true self to the person in the starbucks drive <unk> who am i really though well that's something i reserve for my family my closest friends in fact even some of my closest friends don't know everything about the depths of what it is to be me
maybe for some of you out there there's only one other person in this entire world that has full access to your true self hidden deep within you but <unk> would say is this really how the self works
is the self really like the christian soul hidden somewhere deep within you that only you have access to <unk> would say it very well may be that you put on a mask when you go out in public for the sake of pragmatism and it very well may be that you've reflected on yourself
and you have this idea up your head of who you are that's only accessed by you and your closest friends but don't ignore the possibility that there are multiple levels of deception going on there maybe you're telling yourself a story you want to hear the same way you're telling the starbucks <unk> a story
this concept is a common one in <unk> it's actually one of the main themes in <unk> book crime and punishment the idea that you know we often think we know a lot more about ourselves than we actually do in practice two examples of this
ah bear with me for a second on the first one's a little <unk> but i think it's a really good example to pull us out of this conditioned way we often look at the self and it <unk> us to honestly start asking this question where is this self that we're talking about really located
first example imagine a guy that thinks he's napoleon you know he spends all day every day dressing up in parisian military garb he builds a <unk> out of couch cushions in his front room agonizing to himself how am i going to conquer moscow
that guy now this man believes beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is napoleon if you set him down and then asked him candidly no but who are you really deep down inside he would say i'm napoleon <unk> commander of the armies of the north
husband to a murdered wife father to a murdered son and i will have my vengeance but is this man really napoleon we know he's not napoleon in fact in a weird way as outsiders we seem to have an advantage when it comes to knowing who he really is
interesting here's the less <unk> example and try to think about how this applies to you imagine a guy sitting on the couch watching t v with his pals they turn on the news and there's a story about some mass shooting that happened at a walmart somewhere
he hears the story gets kind of angry turns to his friends and says you know what that guy and people like him they better hope they never shows up at my walmart someone pulls out a gun when i'm there i'm not gonna be one of those people on the news <unk> camera screaming and running out of the store
i'm going to the sporting goods section i may i'm gonna go up into the <unk> like i'm tom cruise and snap the <unk> neck i'm gonna do this because that's just the kind of person i am that's me i'd sacrifice my life for the greater good now he may tell his friends this
he may believe that who he is deep down beyond a shadow of a doubt but if next saturday he's out shopping with his family someone pulls out a gun and all his wife and kids see is a a <unk> of smoke and he's running out the back door who is that guy really
in other words when we reference this thing we call our self intuitively it can feel like well i am my self i know who i am so no one can tell me who i am but me
in fact if you just recited that statement in most public settings people would be like yeah yeah you tell them only you know who you are deep down inside but is that a delusion is that just a narrative that we tell ourselves to simplify this concept of the self
<unk> says that when you take a closer look at the self it's not a soul it's not a personality hidden deep within you what we're referencing when we talk about the self turns out to be much more complex than that with me more moving parts
and i think a good place to begin if we wanna understand <unk> views on what the self really is is to talk about two foundational aspects of what it means to be a human being that to <unk> seem to be constantly intertwined and dependent upon each other what he calls our <unk>
and our transcendence if you are a human being that's alive right now you have both <unk> and transcendence put very simply our <unk> is the collection of facts that are true about us at any given moment
and transcendence is our ability to change or the possibilities that we have at our disposal let's break it down further though remember last time when we talked about being in itself versus being for itself being in itself as being kind of like matter this inert <unk> blob of existence
fully affirmative and being for itself as being consciousness or the source of all <unk> well one day when <unk> trying to meet his monthly quota for obscure sounding philosophical descriptions the way he describes the relationship between these two <unk> categories is that being in itself
quote is what it is and being for itself quote is what it is not well as weird as that sounds in a vacuum after listening to last episode we all know what he means when he says it but then <unk> points out something very mysterious a very strange coincidence
when you look at the relationship between these two <unk> categories two things that are easy to write off as just these meaningless abstract concepts that <unk> cooked up one day when you look at how being in itself and being for itself relate to each other
<unk> notices there seems to be a similar sort of relationship at the foundation of who we are as people see because on one hand all of us have our <unk> and <unk> is kind of like being in itself it's the fully affirmative set of facts that are true about us
you ask me who i am and oftentimes i will state the facts about myself oh i am one hundred and seventeen years old that's a fact i am a horse <unk> by profession that's a fact i make <unk> thousand dollars a year i drive a ford focus
i i i'm scared of spiders things like that right in other words statements of facts that are currently true about us that's what makes up our <unk> but what <unk> would want us to consider is that while these kinds of statements are no doubt useful when it comes to describing certain pieces of who i am
they never tell us the full story and the reason why is because human beings are far more complex than that to fully understand a human being just by default is to understand a type of being that has possibilities none of us are pure <unk> in other words
the only time a human being is pure <unk> is when they're dead yes we have a set of facts that are true about us right now but we always have the ability to change into something else and if we're trying to describe the self if we're trying to look at the whole picture of who someone is
the choices we make about which of these possibilities we're gonna bring about end up being just as important as the facts about who we are right now for example if i'm going to school to become an i t consultant or if i'm training for a marathon or if i'm losing a bunch of weight for wedding pictures
a big part of understanding who i am is understanding the thing i'm actively trying to change into an i t consultant a marathon runner in other words part of understanding the full picture of me is understanding what i am not yet
you can start to hear the weird <unk> description creeping in there just like being in itself is what it is and being for itself is what it is not in a sense i am what i am i have a <unk> but i also am what i am not yet
when i consider my transcendence just like being in itself and being for itself these two aspects of what it is to be a human being <unk> and transcendence are entangled intertwined and in some cases reliant on each other for their very existence
your <unk> and transcendence are constantly affecting each other and that's because the facts of your life are often times caused by what possibilities you decide to bring about and the possibilities you've decided to explore are almost always limited by the facts of your life
let's stop with the <unk> and give a real example alright me i'll use me as an example i am six feet tall a hundred <unk> point two pounds this morning now no matter how much i want to
i am never going to become a horse jockey it's just not gonna happen for me as long as there're people out there that are four four eight <unk> pounds the <unk> that i'm a certain height and weight limits my ability to transcend and the result of that is
i'm never winning the kentucky derby it's not happening this is an example of how our ability to transcend is often times limited by the facts about us another example i was born with a particular face and a particular ability to put on muscle
no matter how much i want to i am never going to be an instagram model the the <unk> of my face my ah my <unk> and and all the other stuff going on there
look i will never be the kind of person that people wanna voluntarily look at and then click an emoji that signifies how they're feeling about the most recent picture of me it's not gonna happen and these facts about me are the parameters i live my life and exercise my freedom within see because that's the thing and this goes for all of you out there
when <unk> talks about radical freedom when any of us talk about being individuals that are free to act as they choose we're never talking about total freedom right it's always freedom within certain limitations
you know we often say things like i can do whatever i want to do but you can't really do anything you want to do right i mean ultimately you're a human being you can't wrap yourself in a protective <unk> and then emerge a unicorn in three days you can't fly to the edge of the universe and look at what's on the other side
no freedom is always freedom within certain limitations and it's those limitations that give a lot of what you choose to do in life it's value we see this in all the various different forms of art you know when someone writes a really good <unk>
we see it as good not because they're the greatest words that could ever have been possibly strung together now the beauty of the <unk> is because we understand that we have given an artist total freedom within a set of limitations that we impose
five syllables seven syllables five syllables go in other words the limitations are a big part of what makes the <unk> beautiful and this applies to life as well
the <unk> that you were born into your own individual limitations are always going to affect the possibilities that you have and what you ultimately choose to do with your life so try to live your life like it's a piece of art you're creating um
but yeah ultimately the point <unk> making here with the concepts of <unk> and <unk> it's not only to stop thinking about your self as though it's this artifact hidden deep within you inside of a vault but also stop thinking about who you are as though it's this static
unchanging thing that you can point to the point that is making is that who you are is always in a state of constant change sometimes small changes sometimes bigger changes but changing and in flux but don't go extreme in the other direction
don't start thinking of your self as this ethereal thing that can never be defined again all the way up until the day you die when you're finally turned into total <unk> you will always have certain facts that are true about you and certain possibilities at your disposal to bring about
unless if you're dead you've never arrived at a destination as a human being now at first glance this may seem like <unk> writing a self help book no no single fact about you sums up who you are release your inner transcendence no
no like we touched on last time <unk> thinks that when people are truly faced with the number of these possibilities are free to choose from most of the time they don't get excited they're horrified by it in fact most of the time once people realize this stuff
<unk> thinks that the secret covert desire of everyone whether they realize it or not is to escape this duality it's to turn themselves into either pure <unk> or pure transcendence or as <unk> says we all secretly want to become god
let's talk about what he means by that think about the way followers of the <unk> religions have traditionally looked at god what is it like to be god well god is perfect god is in this moment everything he will ever be if god had a job interview and the person asked him what's one thing you'd change about yourself
god literally doesn't have an answer to that question but then on the other hand god is all powerful with the snap of his fingers he can do anything he wants to do in other words in this old style traditional view of what god is on one hand
god is perfect as he is pure <unk> but on the other hand god is all powerful and capable of bringing about any possibility he wants in other words pure transcendence <unk> would say this is no coincidence
and it's also no coincidence that as people navigate their lives they have all sorts of tactics they use to turn themselves either into somebody that ignores their possibilities and are perfect as they are right now or someone who ignores the very real unfortunate facts about themselves
and they stay lost in these unattainable dreams their entire life this is the context we needed to understand a concept we talked about well over a year ago on the one episode we did on <unk> the primary tactic that people use in their lives to turn themselves into either pure <unk>
or pure transcendence like god is what <unk> calls bad faith let's take a look at the most famous example of bad faith that <unk> lays out because we already talked about it in the other episode i'll keep it brief
<unk> talks about sitting in the middle of a cafe in paris watching a waiter as he does his job then you can imagine a waiter in the nineteen <unk> right dressed up in his little outfit very upright good posture very proper
he holds the tray in a particular way he walks and changes direction in a very <unk> particular way like a good waiter does <unk> can't help but point out that this guy doesn't seem to be a self with <unk> and transcendence in this moment
he seems to have relegated himself to just playing the part of a waiter he's going to the motions trying to turn himself into pure <unk> just a waiter and nothing else now even though waiters don't act like this often in today's world
go to most restaurants and you can find some modern version of what <unk> talking about here i mean there's so many servers out there that have fallen into bad faith and are just sort of playing the role of the same person it seems to be a modern <unk> of what it is to be a server they all say the same stuff
hi i'm john i'm gonna be taking care you today can i get you guys started with a <unk> bucket of shrimp or some drinks or something but it's at every stage of the meal how's everything tasting for you guys you all save room for desert there's absolutely no rush i'm gonna leave the check here i'm gonna go over there
ask yourself is this the way this guy talks to his mom is this the way he talks to his best friends no he's fallen into bad faith and is just playing the part of a server now the point <unk> making is not that waiters need to be more creative it's not about waiters
<unk> thinks that as human beings we have a tendency to gravitate towards this trap in all aspects of our life we make <unk> about what we are all the time i am a stay at home mom that's my identity
i am a libertarian i am a mormon and that's that what we're desperately trying to do with these <unk> is give ourselves an essence in a world where existence <unk> essence
all these things are just us wanting to think about our selves as some static things set in stone and run from the possibilities that we have now when we take an honest look at the possibilities at our disposal it <unk> us and produces a feeling called nausea
and we use bad faith to <unk> this feeling of nausea we're constantly doing this with ourselves now if all you ever read was <unk> being and nothingness you might get the read from the book that this tendency we have to gravitate towards bad faith
is an <unk> condition of being a human being and that even when we're self aware of the bad faith we're engaging in we're still engaging in bad faith if all you ever read was the main text of being and nothingness you might get that impression and it certainly sounds like a really sad picture
but in one of the footnotes of being and nothingness <unk> <unk> to a way out of all of it and perhaps to an ethics that he'd write later on in this life well he never writes an ethics um and it may be because you know his lifelong partner
and fellow <unk> simone de <unk> produces what many consider to be the greatest <unk> approach to ethics called the ethics of ambiguity next episode is part two once simone de <unk> so we're gonna be talking all about it um but enough of bad faith let's get back to answering this question who am i
really here's the thing when it comes to these concepts of <unk> and transcendence we've been talking about when you just think generally about the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have where are those things located where are you looking to find those
those things aren't hidden somewhere deep down within you that only you have access to you may have a particular perspective of the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have but not only do you have an incentive to slip into bad faith and tell yourself a story about them
<unk> would say you don't have some privileged v i p access to the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have i mean hypothetically any other person if they were diligent enough has access to your <unk> and transcendence
in fact just like the guy that tells himself that he's napoleon sometimes other people are better at telling us who we are than we are but how is this possible the reason it's possible is because the self is not the christian soul to <unk>
just like your <unk> and transcendence what we're referencing when we talk about our selves is outside of us it's an abstraction it's the <unk> of all the things you've ever actually done in your life
when you want to get a solid answer to the question who am i you don't reference the story that you tell yourself in your head that's clouded by all sorts of bad faith and <unk> thinking like the guy that thinks he would try to take down the <unk> at walmart
no we tell ourselves stories all the time what follows from this is that the true measure of your values the true measure of who you are is what you actually do it's the collection of what you've actually done thus far in your life and <unk> says that when you stop looking at the self
as though it's the thing inside of you and you start looking at it more accurately as this abstraction that's outside of us what you inevitably start to realize is that it's impossible to ever get a full picture of who you are without referencing the way that other people view you
more than that it's impossible to ever get a full picture of being without referencing other people and mean here's what he's getting at so far when it comes to describing being we've been presented with being in itself and being for itself but it's right here fairly late in being
and nothingness that <unk> lays out his third <unk> category what he calls <unk> let's talk about what he means <unk> would say that an intrinsic part of what it is to be you is existing alongside other people and all of the consequences that come along with that
this is <unk> concept of <unk> now how does <unk> affect my answer to the question who am i well again this concept of the self is outside of us it's an abstraction
and what <unk> points out is that there are many aspects about who we are that are given to us by other people for example whether we're trustworthy or not whether or not you're a trustworthy person is an aspect of who you are that's mediated by other people right
whether i'm a nice or mean person look i may think of myself as a nice person but if every single other person i encounter all throughout my life says that i'm mean for all intents and purposes i'm a mean person this concept of the self
and how other people view us seem to be connected to <unk> but the flip side of it being that interconnected is that it leaves us an what he <unk> is a a perpetual state of being judged by the people around us
we're almost always being turned into pure <unk> in other people's minds for example have you ever walk around in yourself conscious about the way you look maybe you just got a new pair of shoes and you think they look weird and as you're walking around you feel like every person that passes you is looking at you and they're thinking
wow what were they thinking when they picked out those shoes this is obviously a person that doesn't care very much about the way that they look in other words they're looking at you and they're turning you into an object in their subjective view of the world pure <unk>
you will henceforth be known as the weird shoes guy in that person's mind this is constantly going on but <unk> not saying it's always bad that being around other people is some paranoid everybody's thinking bad things about me all the time thing
people very well may be thinking really good things about you all the time the point that <unk> wants to make is that this whole dynamic this dynamic of other people seeing you putting you on trial and turning you into pure <unk> in their minds this is going on all the time
simply by virtue of the fact that we exist alongside other people and that while the insights other people give us about who we are are no doubt valuable we have to be careful not to slip into bad faith on either side of this dynamic of being for others what i mean is
just because somebody sees you wearing weird shoes one day doesn't mean that you are now weird shoes guy in <unk> in other words don't slip into bad faith when it comes to what people think about you no matter how convenient it may be to prescribe yourself in essence and deny your transcendence
don't turn yourself into pure <unk> and just accept what other people tell you you are maybe you are weird shoes guy right now but you don't have to be in the future but the other side of that is don't deny your <unk> don't tell yourself your shoes are fine
don't tell yourself that you don't care what anyone else says and that what other people think doesn't matter to you at all obviously it does that's slipping into another kind of bad faith
so to sum this up i guess look intuitively
it may seem to us like we have a sort of special access to knowing who we are and that we choose to share ourselves with only our closest friends we trust early but <unk> would say that the reason it seems that way is cause what you actually have is a narrative about yourself
perspective and that the reason it seems like your friends reinforce this picture of who you are
is because that's the very criteria we all use to choose who our friends are gonna be is whether or not they reinforce this picture that we have for ourselves that's what we like about our friends to <unk>
for example if a big part of the way that you view yourself in your identity is that you consider yourself to be a smart person <unk> would predict that most of your friends are gonna be people that are not so smart that tell you that you're smart all the time
or people that ask you a lot of questions that you then answer making you feel smart or other smart people that commend you on being smart like them to <unk> we choose our friends because they reinforce the way that we view ourselves
of course we give them privileged access to our biased narrative of ourselves
and of course it's gonna feel validating of course it would seem that you know better than anyone else who you are but again <unk> would say that the true measure of your values the true answer to the question who are you
is what you actually do thank you for listening i'll talk to you next time
there's sort of like a before we met and an after we met and no gradient
yeah
like i don't
just like i don't even know this guy and then this is the person i work with on everything
and i'm pretty sure the said to him i was like this my best friend
i'm <unk> <unk>
i'm <unk> <unk>
and we're buddies
it's a little hard to summarize the partnership between <unk> and raphael because as best friends and creative collaborators they've done so much over the years together
let me start individually <unk> <unk> won a tony and a grammy for his performance in hamilton
he played thomas jefferson and the marquis de lafayette in the original broadway cast
he's also the vocalist in the experimental hip hop group <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an actor writer and director he's an award winning slam poet and started appearing on h p <unk> def poetry jam at the age of eighteen
over the twenty years these guys have known each other they've worked in theater poetry music and film and usually in some combination of those mediums
they <unk> and <unk> in the film <unk> which premiered at the sundance film festival in two thousand and eighteen
and president obama named it one of his favorite movies of the year
<unk> takes place in oakland which is also where <unk> and <unk> are from
their story begins at berkeley high school here's <unk>
i'm not sure when we met or when we were formally introduced but surely at some sort of poetry event because we were both sort of coming up in that scene
and i was older four years older than him
my freshman year his senior year that's a lifetime apart in high school
my memory of him in high school is like <unk> always had like a very <unk> way about him
and i don't know that this paints it accurately but this is a representation of is like at some point <unk> was like i'm just wearing <unk> pants to school every day
and ah i'm sure that wasn't the whole time i got this little window of it
it was the whole time all the high school for sure
that's amazing
it was like as a rule but we would see each other at these poetry events and he was really really good at writing poems
like a way more sort of focused writer than i had ever been in that situation you know
so i remember that i remember thinking that here's a person that's actually better than me at this thing
and that's pretty cool
then over the years also after when i was in college when i'd come back home for the summers sometimes i'd drop in just to watch like poetry things that were happening sort of check in on the scene
and he was like the dude he had like become that guy
and i remember that so differently
i like barely finished high school in a very in a very nontraditional way and then went off and did this show on h b o def poetry
this just in a skewed perspective for today's youth y'all ladies ain't thin enough fellows ain't trim enough
want to be sexy y'all don't go to the gym enough cut to commercial
came back and had just enough money saved up with some friends to open a very <unk> recording studio and we were looking for other artists we didn't have anybody else recording at the studio
and so a mutual friend of ours one of his close friends who was the older brother of one of my close friends was like you know <unk> <unk>
yeah we really got set up on like a rapper play date
and so our friend justin was like you guys should work together you're two of my favorite rappers
so i was like yeah yeah and he played me stuff and it was really good
i didn't have anywhere record i was recording songs in my mom's closet in the little closet in my room
i hadn't been in a lot of studio spaces so i was oh studio
i don't know that this qualified as an actual i
i know that yeah
because i hadn't been there yet
but i don't think we had any idea like what meeting each other and actually getting time was gonna be like
finally we started it was like this is the song we're gonna work
we had listened through some beats and it was like let's work on this one
i just started writing and yeah it happened really fast
and at some point we looked up and everyone else was gone and it was just the two of us in there we were still making music
we just made music until the sun came up and like began the ritual that day of like going to the car at eight a m
and playing everything that you'd recorded and then like dragging your body home to sleep and kind of doing it all over again
i'd been making music for many many years and it had never been that much fun before
suddenly there's this person that like writes a verse in five minutes and can nail it in a take
and at the time we were like working with some random singers and several like couldn't ever sing the line and rappers who took like an hour to get a verse down
it was just like wow this is so easy and then we were just have songs done
what we always joke about is like there's sort of like a before we met and an after we met and no gradient
yeah
i don't even know this guy and then this is the person i work with
on everything
and i'm pretty sure this said to him i was like this is my best friend
like
as a young artist early on when i'm still trying to figure things out and creating is hard for me being around somebody who just creates all the time it was so addictive
i don't have the technical skill set that <unk> has so like he was so fast in pro tools
he was so all of these things that i just i would have to labor over and then all of that stuff became really impressive too
once you know as we started working together and i became aware that he had taught himself all of these things like nobody ever really showed him how to do anything it seemed like
and he was editing videos and shooting thing you know ah the whole range of what it takes to be a music artist like out in the world he had taught himself to do
i didn't really know anybody like that
you know over the next four or five years we recorded hundreds of songs that <unk> heard
no-one will ever hear
like shit ah hundreds
and wrote a play together and then we lived together and it was like oh man
when we're around each other this much it's like we have too many ideas
it was like the the right amount of proximity for like the full version of creativity that we had always
like we had thought we'd already tapped it and we like did so much shit that year
yeah
i think <unk> we were doing great
yeah we're definitely making it and we were definitely broke
the thing it was like
got on the radio
this is also great listen now he says we this was really <unk> was known right
he had a song that got played on like clear channel radio and then got named like one of the bay area freshmen ten it's like
best new whatever
he got named one of those but <unk> never would take that for himself and it was always like us
we are and so like we played those shows together and like would end up making no money on these gigs
because he would bring me and a band like four or five other people to play music use the entire fee to fly us out to a wherever georgia and like play a show where no-one would make any money but we got to play a show
he was like doing that from jump for so long
why was that how you would always do it
well cause i wanna i don't i'm uncomfortable with i statements
berkeley is shit
i'm a good roll
they feel self indulgent
that was raised to not feed an ego that feels constantly eager for food
what i love about that period is like we were all pushing to little different degrees of success
we're just kind of <unk> that like almost in a scene that we kind of make sense in
they didn't understand <unk> very much at all i feel like the more commercial bay areas scene
and they only sort of understood me like it was very like yeah yeah you're in but like don't try to make any changes you know
and i think that's a big reason that we went to l a
we could see the top of the ladder and it's not getting any <unk> or more receptive
and we maybe can make this movie and maybe there's like different music opportunities down there but it's definitely not gonna happen here
and then suddenly we like packed up from the west oakland place and moved to l a
also we had already been we were working on <unk> and so we'd been traveling up and down
and our producers we had been driving to meet with them really frequently
we were <unk> it so hard and we got to l a we were so poor <unk> was delivering <unk>
yeah i was like i couldn't be an actor in l a is what i decided
we're just like swinging and missing
just tried to figure out like what does it mean to be in the bigger pond and like wanna be artists professionally
and we did five years in l a before <unk> went to new york to do hamilton
i think that was one of those things that came about for <unk> really organically
hamilton was such an interesting like must like it was a play it was like legit written for him to flex all the things he's good at
they were like who's this like rap kid that like turns out can also act
and the rest of us were like turns out like he's been doing that more than a lot of y'all you know
and the world saw <unk> in the light that best showed everything and they not only accepted but obsessed over it
and then i went to visit him in new york when the show was picking up steam
and the first thing that happened is this girl grabs my arm and looks at <unk> and goes oh my god is that <unk> <unk> to me
and i like start to realize that this woman is anne <unk> like and she's like <unk> out
and i'm like oh man like a major shift is happening
my life is changing very very quickly i was under stress constantly
<unk> is like calling and texting and emailing and i'm like getting back to the degree that i can
and so like yes obviously it would have been like so much easier and nicer if my best friend was also living in new york and somebody who has context for me outside of this thing
and i remember like somebody turned to <unk> and i was like i'm thinking about moving to new york so you'll respond more in person
i remember <unk> goes i didn't wanna ask
that's like a big ask and like i'm doing eight shows a week now like move to new york and like let's go kick it in the <unk>
you know like you it was like move to new york and i'll see you like at midnight sometimes
but as it was you just good for him to have a friend there but also like can i run your social media
because you're not posting enough and like people want to see this adventure and like there's a sincere way to do it
and i had done like a little bit of it with his twitter and stuff in the bay and in l a but like this was like give me your passwords i probably already had them
this was an admission that he was going to
and i was like yeah yeah do that
and especially if you actually don't have to do it
be <unk> i'm doing it
you know like like oh there's like a year of his instagram that's just his friend's version of how awesome is
you know
<unk> got started because around when i was <unk> one of my friends got killed in a way that sort of didn't make a lot of sense to most people in the community
and it was sort of like the breaking point because it was a woman because it was somebody like wasn't really involved in the violence of the world that we were existing in at the time
some other people had been killed and other people i sort of was close to there was a series of funerals people had gone to in succession
and this was the button on it it was just like a breaking point for me
and so i had written this poem about sort of like the numbness of that experience of like god is this like what life is
it's like people die and we get numb and we care a little less every time like how does this go
and then we just kind of started coming up with a story that was a movie that's in verse starring the two of us
we kept almost making <unk> and not making it
<unk> he finishes this massive sensation in new york he had like thirty days in june that he could shoot this movie
twenty-two
and in a month later we were in oakland shooting the movie
in the hometown like everybody who's an extra in that movie is a friend of ours that we grew up with
and it's still not a real movie to us it's still a thing we can't believe they made
in hollywood in a world that we always assumed we didn't belong in you know that we never really figured out how we would fit into anyway
to have doors start opening in a way where they're sort of asking questions about what you want to do it's crazy actually
it's just fun in meetings post <unk> now that we're associated together in this way and also people gonna able to see that <unk> is a great actor as well as a great writer
like or it's like what's he doing do you think he'd be interested in this
can you talk to him for us it's like pretty i love that i love that so much
and i still know the ten things that he can do that nobody's seen yet and that's still fun for me
the closest i have ever gotten to fighting with <unk> i think is like when somebody else i'm close to is fighting with <unk> right
i think that's sort of our good cop bad cop type of
where someone will be like <unk> to him and he's like i don't know what to tell you i've already picked my team
we have this expression that we always say we did this before every show and we kind of do it anytime we're at crossroads we're like
it's just like this whole ship runs on enthusiasm

from e s p n you're listening to thirty for thirty podcast my name is jody <unk> welcome to our fifth season of original audio documentaries as we've done before we're <unk> the entire season to one story is total over five parts
it's about a scandal that rocked n b a and tells us a lot about how power race and celebrity intersect in modern sports
for this season we're excited to work with e s p n ramona <unk> one of our top n b a reporters and l a needed and someone who's been covering the story from the moment it broke
ramona is your host for all five episodes the quick order of warning this season contains mature subject matter and language and now coming up back the break from thirty for thirty and undefeated the stirring up fears
<unk> sterling thought she was just gonna return some clothes to <unk> marcus when she got in her mercedes <unk> station wagon and made the drive from <unk> to beverly hills it was early in the spring of two thousands and fourteen
and even though <unk> was almost eighty years old she was still going into town as rich people call beverly hills four or five days a week it's hard to guess <unk> age if you don't know it
because she keeps her hair a convincing pale blonde and her face is very <unk> driving into beverly hills is basically like entering a state park for the rich and famous
there are the iconic brown and yellow signs that let you know you have entered a special place and <unk> sterling and her husband donald owned a ton of it
over their sixty year marriage the <unk> built a real estate empire in their <unk> they were the largest residential landlords in l a county
but most people knew her husband donald sterling as the long time owner of the los angeles <unk> one of the worst owners in all of sports his team was the <unk> of the n b a for decades
for <unk> it should have been would have been just a <unk> down <unk> drive to return some wildly expensive clothes but unbeknownst to her her husband was also at <unk> marcus that day
with a woman <unk> years his junior named v <unk> she wasn't the first mistress not even close but v was something different
<unk> told me that story when we met in the winter of two thousand and nineteen at the beverly hills plaza hotel or my hotel as she calls it
<unk> was <unk> at the time but she can tell that story of that <unk> with donald and v five years earlier with exacting detail
i happened to be there to return something and she was there with donald and with some other friends and we had a big confrontation she was very very very nasty and mean to me
what happened was that she ran into <unk> i think at <unk> and they started talking and i guess things got out of hand
that's v <unk> lawyer mac <unk> and when i told <unk> sterling his version of the story she scoffed
it was at <unk> marcus
at first i thought it was funny that <unk> took the time to correct him i mean here is a woman talking to a female reporter about her husband's infidelity who cares whether you confront your husband's mistress outside of <unk> marcus or <unk>
but the details matter here it's important to get it right because that meeting outside <unk> marcus that petty <unk> between a wife and her husband's mistress set off a chain of events
that in the end led to one of the biggest scandals in professional sports a controversy that forced the n b a to finally deal with donald sterling after decades of his bad behavior and had ripple effects throughout the entire league
this is the sterling affairs from thirty for thirty podcasts and the undefeated i'm ramona <unk>
i've covered basketball in l a for a long time the n b a is a league of huge personalities and even bigger egos fighting for power and if you want the real score that's the game you have to follow
i learned pretty quickly that there's no other owner in basketball with quite the same personality or ego of donald sterling sterling wasn't a basketball guy he was a personal injury lawyer and then he got filthy rich off of real estate
that's what he was really good at
i could never understand why he even kept the <unk> when his reputation as an owner was so bad but that's because i always assumed that deep down he wanted what everyone in the game is supposed to want to win
but rich people like donald sterling multi billion dollar rich people don't live in the same world as the rest of us don't play by the same rules when you have enough money it's like you're rubber everything just bounces off of you
even three decades of driving an n b a franchise into the ground when you're as rich as donald and <unk> you get to tell yourself that everything is fabulous
i feel fabulous
feel fabulous
fabulous
he was just so fabulous
i was born and raised in l a and i've never heard anyone use the word fabulous as much as these two do
they were fabulous it was just fabulous
even their court battles
i want to thank everybody who has helped me my attorneys they were fabulous
and of course anything related to their team
and the u s team that won at all the fabulous american team we are fabulous let's give a hand to america u s a
and donald <unk> life was fabulous why would he think otherwise nobody ever questioned him to his face anyway he did whatever he wanted he said whatever he wanted he had relationships with whomever he wanted
i didn't know v <unk> back then and yes that's her real name v just the letter v with a period she was born maria vanessa perez
but changed her name to v <unk> at about the same time she'd met donald at a super bowl party in two thousand and ten before that she had been trying desperately to climb out of the poverty that she'd grown up in
she'd been running a food truck business and trying to work her way onto reality t v shows and <unk> up to whomever was the most relevant powerful or famous then she met donald
there's an unwritten contract between young women and their very rich but much older sugar <unk> that helps each side pretend it's about love and not sex for money never talk about age pretend looks don't matter
money and hermes bags are gifts and never ever <unk> the wife but v <unk> either didn't know or didn't care because she broke every last rule in the mistress terms and agreements
she went right at <unk>
she said to the people in the office i'm gonna own the office one day and she said to the <unk> people she says this is gonna be my team one day i mean just bold really bold
and it all got back to me you know
she kept telling people she was going to be the next mrs sterling
<unk> <unk> is one of <unk> best friends and a longtime <unk> fan
she would stalk <unk> she would watch where <unk> would go and then she'd show up and i do remember the one time she went into the <unk> where <unk> was just <unk> around showed off herself then <unk> walked out
at <unk> games the entire extended sterling universe was usually there and usually just feet from one another sometimes <unk> and donald sat in their <unk> seats together and v sat in her seats directly across the court
other nights v would sit next to donald and <unk> was nowhere to be seen <unk> players like ryan <unk> and matt barnes got used to v being around you couldn't not notice her
she would just parade around the arena and it like it was so awkward like we kind of know what's going on but you're doing it in front of our faces as if we were silly and so it was an odd odd situation
nobody liked her we knew why she was here and we all thought it was crazy to begin with but you know it wasn't our place to speak on it at the time
<unk> employees often got caught in the middle of this bizarre triangle <unk> would call team president andy <unk> demanding that v not be allowed in the building and then donald would call <unk> and ask him to leave four tickets for her
these were relationships begging to <unk> but none of the entangled ever tried to solve the problem donald <unk> v each kept pushing each other waiting for someone to break
well the breaking started on christmas day two thousand and twelve v called the sterling house asking to speak to donald
we were all sitting down christmas day having dinner and she called
<unk> was mortified the family was sitting at the dinner table waiting for donald as he's pacing on the tennis courts outside fighting with his mistress
i don't know they had some argument and um the family heard about it you know and it just it wasn't a good scene
the fight with <unk> started when he hung up
not that that was uncommon even without v they fought often but this was escalating <unk> and <unk> youngest son scott had to step in before it got physical he confronted his father and demanded he stop this nonsense with v
and stopped <unk> his mother like this
it was a big moment but nothing came of it
a week later scott died
it was first reported to be a <unk> <unk> but later revealed to be an overdose he was thirty-two
and i don't think people realize this but you lost a child
i know
right around then
january first
<unk> was devastated
i was going through the motions of living
it wasn't just that the fight with v was a last volatile moment between donald and scott
when scott died donald stayed with v instead of going home to his wife as she grieved it was too much she kicked don out of the house
<unk> needed breathing room and i think don had pushed the envelope a little too far
i really thought that we probably were gonna be getting a divorce
but <unk> and donald had been together too long been through too much together had too much of their lives and their money intertwined
they did not divorce the situation simply continued to deteriorate over the next year as donald spent more and more time with v
plus <unk> was starting to learn about the gifts v posted pictures on instagram v driving the two hundred and forty thousand dollars red <unk> that donald had bought her
and the range rover and the two <unk> <unk> also found out that donald had bought v a one point eight million dollar <unk>
when i found out that he had paid for all the cars and he paid for this house i was furious
it was that anger <unk> brought to <unk> marcus with her returns on the fateful day she that she encountered donald and v it wasn't the first time the two women had run into each other or argued but this time <unk> decided she'd had enough
and that's when i decided i was gonna sue her
on march seven two thousand and fourteen <unk> sterling filed a lawsuit in california superior court against v <unk> seeking the return of all those gifts from donald
donald and <unk> sterling were worth multiple billions of dollars and had done what the ultra rich do put all their money and property into a joint trust
every dime the <unk> spent cost each of a them a nickel therefore <unk> argued the money that donald used to pay for the gifts was just as much hers as it was his
so she turned to the courts that sounds a little extreme well you don't know the <unk> calling a lawyer is how they get out of bed in the morning
to say they're <unk> is like saying there's traffic on the four or five and besides suing to get what they want had proven incredibly effective for the <unk> over the years
most people didn't have the means or the stomach to battle them in court they'd settle before they starved
she kept saying to donald you better have her drop the lawsuit and he'd say oh she won't really go through with it but she's just doing it for effect and she says well she better drop the lawsuit
but here's how the lawsuit the courtroom product of a bedroom dispute really came to change everything for some time now v had been recording her conversations with donald
<unk> i'm sorry
i'm so sorry too we made a giant mistake both of us
and according to v and her lawyer donald was aware she was making the tapes
he'd been forgetting things he said to her and the tapes were a way of reminding him
please leave me alone please please
she'd recorded hundreds of conversations over the past two years a lot of the recordings were mundane boring even but some of the recordings were arguments and captured a side of donald that he would never want his wife or anyone else to hear
i guess that you don't know that maybe you're stupid
no matter what the original intent of those tapes was they became something v could use as <unk> because v <unk> had no intention of returning those gifts from donald
she wanted me to drop the lawsuit
v says to donald i want that bitch wife of yours lawsuit dismissed
pierce o'donnell is <unk> <unk> lawyer
and he tried to get <unk> to dismiss it and she wouldn't do it
if donald couldn't or wouldn't fix the situation v decided she would take matters into her own hands it was time to use the tapes
to reveal donald sterling for who he really was

on april nine two thousand and fourteen a <unk> executive assistant texted v on behalf of donald
the text was to make sure that v understood she wasn't welcome at the game against the oklahoma city thunder later that evening that her tickets her v i p pass and her parking had been revoked
v responded with a series of escalating texts saying she was going to the game anyway and then some veiled threats
i would hate for staple center to get involved in what's going on
three hours later she got a response
mister sterling said to let me know if you need anything we don't want to have any issues at the game
v had her opening
no you tell mister sterling that i don't need anything nor do i want anything but thanks for asking let the games begin
attached to the text was an audio file and when the <unk> employee opened the file she heard this
in your lousy instagram you don't have to have yourself with walking with black people
and it bothers you
yeah it bothers me a lot that you want to promote broadcast that you're associating with black people do you have to
you associate with black people
i'm not you and you're not me you're supposed to be a delicate white or delicate latina girl
i'm a mixed girl
it was shocking the <unk> assistant immediately emailed the file to <unk> president andy <unk> and that's how <unk> learned about the tape too
i didn't even know that the tape was sent to the <unk> until somebody at a game told me that they said they received a tape from her
and i said well what is the tape about so i said to andy andy <unk> i said andy what are you doing about this and he says oh well she'll never do anything
<unk> had worked for donald sterling for nearly three decades he did what everybody learns to do after a while stay out of the really ugly stuff
donald and <unk> had cleaned up their own messes for six decades he figured they'd eventually make this one go away too but they didn't <unk> told her lawyers about the tapes
and they in turn went to <unk> lawyer and demanded to hear them and that's when v <unk> made her big move
i got a call by a trusted confidential source who said you have to hear this
mike <unk> was the news director at t m z at the time now he runs his own celebrity news site the blast
the first thing i did was say who's donald sterling i had heard the name i knew that donald sterling was important but i had no idea that he owned the <unk>
even for someone from t m z whose job was breaking the internet with the <unk> most controversial stories this felt like something different
i received the audio and said oh my god
it was the most repulsive disgusting
unbelievable
audio or moment that i'd ever heard in my lifetime come out of somebody's mouth that then once i realized who they were how much impact that may have
but no one in <unk> world seemed to realize
the fact is <unk> and several people in the <unk> organization heard the recording and decided not to act on it or weren't appalled enough to act on it maybe they didn't understand how big a splash this tape could make
i think this deals with very <unk> subjects like racism sexism
things that touch everyone in this country so i knew with all of that combined with the fact that it actually was on tape
and if i could do my job properly everyone was gonna hear it that this would be a gigantic thing
so mike <unk> called up the n b a their new commissioner adam silver had barely been in office for three months
i actually had never heard of adam silver until that day
turns out not even t m z was gonna release something like this without some due diligence
there is a balance between privacy of people and the public's interest in what is said in this audio and i think everyone will agree with me when i say this
this had to be heard period
after calling the league t m z called the <unk> to let them know they were about to publish a tape that would be very damaging to donald sterling
if you're donald sterling there's never a good time to have your girlfriend out you as a racist if you're the <unk> this could not have happened at a worse moment donald <unk> <unk> had been a laughing stock for decades
because honestly like these <unk> jokes is something we they're not even jokes they're statements of fact
in the thirty some odd years he had owned the team they'd only made the playoffs six times they'd never even moved past the <unk> that had all started to change in the late two thousands thought the team had drafted a star blake griffin
n b a rookie of the year blake griffin
and then ended up with another star chris paul
los angeles is electric with the addition of chris paul to the <unk>
had you heard of the <unk> before this
after a trade saga that rocked the n b a and somehow ended up in favor of the perennial loser <unk> over the n b a's golden child the los angeles <unk>
the buzz in los angeles has instantly shifted to the <unk>
in time for this season the <unk> had also managed to get themselves one of the best coaches in the n b a doc rivers
it's doc rivers to the <unk> three years <unk> million dollars
there was a hope of stability balance even winning
two thousand twelve saw one playoff run two thousand thirteen saw another and two thousand forty was gonna be the year where they might finally contend for a championship
i'm excited to bring a championship here to l a in a <unk> uniform
but now the <unk> curse was about to rear its head yet again
the one thing i can always rely on is that the <unk> screw things up
once the <unk> staff found out t m z was going to publish the tape andy <unk> went to coach doc rivers he needed him to talk to the team before the story broke
andy i remember coming into my office one day and said hey there's a tape that t m z has this is gonna come out it's not that flattering but it's not a big deal honestly i thought it was a sex tape because um donald sterling i really did
so doc did as he was told he gathered the players and warned them that something was coming superstar <unk> forward blake griffin and center ryan <unk> were in that room
doc gathered us
doc said hey guys we need to meet and talk
this is about to come out
we don't know what the heck this is going to turn into
people are gonna run with this none of us realized the extent um cause we didn't hear the recording or whatever it was
he tells us to kind of prepare yourself because we're playing golden state and the focus at hand is win the game
so i think we were all kind of like alright well this is another thing we'll get ready for this game
alright welcome back to sports center where we have some breaking news a disturbing story including the owner of one of the n b a playoff teams but
t m z dropped this story at ten p m pacific time on a friday night april twenty fifth two thousand fourteen
this is an audio recording <unk> of los angeles <unk> owner donald sterling making racist remarks to his girlfriend is being investigated by the national basketball association
why should you be walking publicly with black people
does it matter if they're white or blue or yellow
i guess that you don't know that maybe you're stupid
i was covering the n b a playoffs for e s p n when this scandal broke like literally i was <unk> at a game in portland and i got a frantic phone call from our news desk
telling me i had to listen to this tape
people call you and tell you that i have black people on my instagram and it bothers you
yeah it bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associating with black people do you have to
suddenly the playoff game between the trail <unk> and the houston rockets taking place in front of me seemed completely insignificant
i filed my game story and tried to start wrapping my head around this one
like t m <unk> mike <unk> as soon as i heard that tape i knew this was going to be huge
the disgraced <unk> owner in the spotlight
sterling has a long history of questionable behavior
it's obviously appalling it's very disturbing but um to be quite honest with you i wasn't too surprised
within hours the audio of donald sterling making racist remarks to v <unk> had gone viral
t m <unk> <unk> and reporters swarmed the lobby of the <unk> team hotel they had booked several rooms at the four seasons in advance so they could legally be inside the private property
outside the hotel was even more chaotic the whole world wanted a reaction <unk> team security advised players and staffers to stay inside their hotel rooms as much as possible they were on lockdown
when it came out i remember it just being chaos it just from then on it was just ah that's all anybody was talking about
by morning lebron james the biggest star in the league was saying there was no room for a person like donald sterling in the n b a
and across the country adam silver was facing his first real crisis
n b a commissioner adam silver sitting down in memphis addressing the comments made by donald sterling
the audio recording posted by t m z is truly offensive and disturbing and we intend to get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible
silver launched an investigation within hours
i'm not yet prepared to discuss any potential sanctions against donald sterling we will however move extraordinarily quickly in our investigation
if it was sterling on those tapes if they hadn't been <unk> or altered silver knew he wanted to punish him severely the league was outraged
because on top of donald sterling saying all these <unk> racist things sterling was also taking shots at one of the most beloved figures in all of basketball magic johnson
it was as shocking and as bizarre anything on the tape that a picture of v <unk> and magic johnson had set him off to hear donald sterling talk that way about magic
the guy who'd turned the <unk> into a dynasty who'd fought off h i v that's the guy donald sterling told his mistress wasn't welcome at his games
plain and simple when you heard those comments magic what was your reaction
that was really upset you know um you can't understand how hurt i was he shouldn't own a team any more especially when you have african americans renting his apartments coming to the games
and playing for him and coaching for him this is this is bad for everybody it's bad for america and so i'm really upset about it
even the famously apolitical michael jordan voiced his outrage
michael jordan weighed in there is no room in the n b a or anywhere else for the kind of racism and hatred that mr sterling allegedly expressed we cannot tolerate must not tolerate discrimination at any level
but the story was bigger than the n b a it revealed something raw and ugly it triggered millions of people
it's like what one of the <unk> who was <unk> donald and <unk> told me it had all the elements sex money sports politics greed racism
it had everything it even had the <unk> you remember the <unk> that <unk> punk welding mask meets florida grandma <unk> that v <unk> wore any time she stepped outside her house
but still say nothing is v <unk> not late this afternoon when she arrived home or when she left tonight wearing different clothes but color coordinated face shields
the woman who set this whole thing off was out there <unk> for the <unk>
have you talked to mr sterling can you explain the mask
this was a full on media circus
why are you wearing the shield why are you holding a microphone
i don't know it's my job well then it's my job
by the end of the weekend the first black president of the united states was answering questions about sterling
i suspect that the n b a is gonna deeply concerned and in resolving this you know we the united states um continues to wrestle with a legacy of of race
the tapes dominated the news cycle not just because they were juicy but because donald sterling was articulating something deeper more shameful
a plantation mentality that's at the heart of a lot of this country's history
that's an n b a owner a man worth billions of dollars going on for more than nine minutes <unk> the most vile of racist thoughts a white owner whose <unk> roster was stacked with a majority of african american players
including ryan <unk>
those words hurt when you hear i don't want people like that well the people like that play for you the people like that buy your tickets the people like that bleed just like you <unk>
earthquakes both real and metaphorical happened suddenly but they are anything but sudden the tremor is a product of tensions that build up for years until the fault lines simply break
los angeles sits on two fault lines the san andreas and race all of us know it we live with it donald sterling was another
anyone who played for him or worked for him or covered him in the press or lived in one of his hundreds of apartments on the one hand knew that it was all a matter of time until he blew up the underlying issues with sterling were well known and well documented
but like most insanely wealthy white men in america donald had managed to wiggle bully and fight his way out of all he knew how to play his leverage and power <unk> his adversaries and win you can call it that
but this time felt different
i remember i had said ah this is really bad really bad and i i knew something was gonna happen i didn't know what it was like shock
that's what we all were shocked but we shouldn't have been surprised
facebook's had fifteen months of quote fresh hell but two point one billion still use it or instagram or whatsapp messenger everyday
from american public media this is marketplace tech <unk> the digital economy and jack steward informally wood
despite the privacy scandals the federal investigations and the accusations of destroying democracy this week facebook reported its advertising revenue and global users are growing
in this week's quality assurance we take a deeper dive into why in its early years facebook prioritized growth over everything else
nearly every crisis facebook now faces stems from that nicholas thompson <unk> of wired says that's left <unk> navigate metaphorical mind field
there was a lot of <unk> ordinance that they were inevitably going to step on it some point
he's an author on the <unk> latest cover story which goes behind the scenes of the troubled company he says facebook's business is actually solid for couple of reasons
number one the advertising business model they came up with is one of the greatest ever and it doesn't require lots of changes they just built an amazing business model and the marginal costs of bringing in new advertisers are very low
secondly one of the smartest business decisions that mark zuckerberg ever made was to buy instagram and people don't really understand that instagram is owned by facebook or if they distrust facebook they don't distrust instagram so instagram continues to grow
so they make lots of money off of core facebook they have lots of user growth on instagram and whatsapp and the business is doing great
you would think at some point that maybe advertisers would start to push back i mean if facebook's reputation has really taken this really huge dent that it appears it has why do people still want to advertise with it
well because the advertising continues to work if at some points people have an <unk> feeling when they use facebook and therefore the ads are less effective then advertisers will leave
but at this moment facebook allows you to very specifically target specific users in ways that you cannot on other platforms and for lots of advertisers that's just a deal that's too good to pass up
now facebook is anticipating once up to a five billion dollar fine from the federal trade commission we heard that from this week about how it's handled some of these privacy issues
will they even feel that is the question they have so much cash on hand is is it a big deal
no so facebook put out in their earnings call they said they anticipate a three to five billion dollar fine i don't know whether that's because those are the numbers the f t c has been talking about with them or if facebook is just trying to set expectations as a negotiating tactic
i would not rule out the possibility that facebook is hit with a ten billion dollar fine or a twenty billion dollar fine regardless to your question even if it is at the higher end whether it's five or ten or twenty it's tiny
their market cap is up i believe forty billion dollars as we talk this morning so it's not a huge hit to them obviously they would rather have five billion dollars than not have five billion dollars but they will be fine regardless of what this number comes out at
the thing they really worry about is antitrust if there is antitrust regulation and it comes down hard on them that is a serious problem and that would make the market drop dramatically
what are the stakes for facebook's leadership around all of these scandals that the fake news the offensive content the privacy you you know you detail that they've got something like thirty thousand moderators now ah does that mean they're actually taking this seriously as a business risk
yes absolutely facebook is taking it very seriously as a business risk so there are two really interesting questions um in there so number one is do they take this seriously as a business risk absolutely are they committed to trying to counter fake news and all of the manipulation on the platform
absolutely what are the stakes to their business they are a very high if scandal continues to multiply there could be real consequences down the road what are the stakes specifically to top management meaning mark zuckerberg and sheryl sandberg two people who we most associate with the company
for zuckerberg he's going to run the company as long as he wants to he has voting control of the shares he's appointed his friends as board members he is in a good position
whenever he wants to go and run the chan zuckerberg initiative or just go be an intellectual thought leader or do bill gates type things he will go choose to do that for sandberg it's tougher
and there were moments in the last year where it seemed like she might be sacrificed or where she might be in big trouble zuckerberg has expressed his loyalty to her
but as the scandals multiplied and as they started to touch her in a way they never had before it seemed as though her position was at risk and it is also certainly the case that the public reputation of both of them has dropped
a year ago we were talking about each of them as potential presidential candidates now there's not a chance
what about the morale in the wider company in the wake of all of this do you get the feeling from the people you've been talking to and your reporting that employees are fairly satisfied there and that i'm laughing even as i say that or is there a whole lot of internal chaos at this company
there is a lot more employee dissatisfaction than there was two years
ago there are lots of employees who i talk to there who say oh this place is great it's cool you know the media hates us but that's not my problem i'm happy um and there are a bunch of other people who say you know we deserve a lot of the hatred we made a lot of mistakes
we trampled on people's privacy and you know i regret all that we've done i talk to a lot of people who are thinking about going to work there and it doesn't have the halo that it did two years ago
they still pay you well the fact that the stock continues to go up is great particularly for people who have options
but it is a less exciting place to work and that is one of the true risks for the company and one of the most adverse effects of the last two years for facebook
ah did any part in this reporting particularly you know give how much time you've spent on facebook directly now did anything really surprise you
there was one specific story that stunned me and that was the circumstances that led to the departure of the two founders of instagram kevin <unk> and mike <unk>
and when fred <unk> and i started reporting the story and we made a list of the mysteries we wanted to solve and that was at the very top why had they left it seemed strange they had left all of a sudden in september
no one knew why and late in the reporting you know months into reporting the story we finally learned the full story and that is that according to people close to them they had grown frustrated with <unk> increased meddling
they didn't like the idea that instagram was gonna be further merged with whatsapp and with facebook and there was real tension over <unk> growth
and there was a sense among some people at facebook that <unk> growth was coming at the expense of core facebook and that led to all kinds of tensions and then a big fight at the end of july and a moment where mark zuckerberg
according to people who observing all of this asked one of his <unk> to draw up a list of all the ways that facebook supported instagram the way it drove users towards instagram
and then he gave the list to kevin <unk> and said we're getting rid of all of these and according to people familiar with the story <unk> reacted quite badly to that and then went on <unk> leave came back and said i'm done here
and so the biggest surprise to us was that the departure of <unk> and <unk> which hadn't come out before was much <unk> much <unk> than i had believed when i began reporting the story
nick thompson <unk> of wired for context a five billion dollar fine would be a record tech penalty in the u s <unk> the twenty-two million the google have to pay in twenty twelve
and now for some related links the new york times has a good <unk> on why both facebook and the f t c would be happy with a chunky fine one ends up looking strong the other looks accountable but really nothing much changes
european regulators have been tougher on tech companies google facebook and twitter all have to do more to tackle fake news to satisfy them and they want to see progress ahead of e u elections next month that's according to <unk>
and even canada's getting in on the action according to the c b c this week privacy regulators there say facebook broke several laws over unauthorized data access they plan to take the company to court
if you enjoyed mark <unk> testimony in front of congress here in the u s with his <unk> <unk> like senator we run ads then maybe you'll enjoy hearing more directly from mr zuckerberg himself
i mean facebook was accused of not being open enough i'm not really sure how deep into the heads of tech entrepreneurs you really want to get but <unk> has a podcast now i'm not suggesting you listen i'm just giving you this information
it's called tech and society with mark zuckerberg just yeah don't at me my <unk> produce this weeks marketplace tech along with stephanie hughes and each row is a senior producer
i'm jack stewart for now that's marketplace tech this is a p m
this is a p m
if you want to get broadband access to every state you gotta know the local laws from american public media this is marketplace tech <unk> the digital economy i'm molly wood
the digital economy as we like to call it over here depends pretty heavily on access to the internet and that is still not a solved problem here in the united states
over thirty percent of americans don't have access to broadband internet which is defined as twenty-five <unk> per second or higher that's according to research released tuesday by the n p d group
the pew charitable trusts has an initiative dedicated to figuring out why this is the case today the organization's broadband research initiative is launching a new tool that lets anyone browse through broadband policies and funding in any state in the u s
it sorts the information in categories like funding competition and regulation infrastructure access and broadband definitions
like in alabama for example broadband speed is defined as only ten <unk> for seconds if your network is busy that's barely fast enough to stream netflix and high death
kathryn de wit manages the broadband research initiative for the pew charitable trusts she told me state policy is a huge deal when it comes to expanding broadband access
state policy matters because lack of access to broadband is a national issue but it is felt at the local level and states have taken a pretty aggressive approach to closing gaps in access particularly over the last five years
we've seen a significant uptick in legislation since <unk> um and what we can take away from this is not only do state policy makers see and feel that immediate urgency of ah lack of broadband access
that's they're saying it's important to things like education health care and ah economic developments but they're also saying this is what we want our state to look like they're setting goals and then they're laying out a path and a framework for how to achieve those goals
let's just dive into some of what is in the tool some of the different approaches that states are taking like could you give me an example of two totally different approaches that states might have taken
so going into this research we knew that states ah face similar challenges in increasing access to broadband ah but we learned that they're also taking similar approaches but adapting ah them to their needs that's really where those categories came from those groupings
ah if you look at goals for example ah you have states like minnesota and west virginia where their statewide broadband goals are focused on <unk> universal coverage
then you look at a state like california ah that has a goal to connect <unk> percent of the population and each one of its roughly twenty regions
how do you hope that a tool like this can help close the digital divide in terms of broadband access
well this tool is actually the first step in our ongoing research on how states are addressing gaps in broadband access so for us this was about understanding that <unk> landscape of broadband deployment laws
and it provides the basis for our next level of research which is a deeper examination of how states are addressing those gaps in access
what we hope though is that ah users will be able to use this tool to learn what other states are doing and how they're actually doing it
kathryn de wit manages the broadband research initiative for the pew charitable trusts we've got a link to that new tool and some analysis about spending per state at our website marketplace tech dot org
and now for some related links so this tool is super new obviously and pew hopes that policymakers and local governments will jump in and start creating some more analysis and comparison and of course they'll be publishing their own pieces
the first one that i mentioned there is about how states fund their broadband projects whether it's grants or loans or general funds kind of things or some creative funding
apparently illinois makes internet service providers pay into a special <unk> called the digital divide elimination fund and it uses that to pay for broadband <unk>
and in virginia a legal settlement with tobacco producers is paying to build more internet
look i'm not saying this isn't a little <unk> over here but it is interesting also i got to be honest i'm still hung up on that ten <unk> per second in alabama and probably some other states too i haven't made it through the entire tool yet
but <unk> regulation also says i s <unk> can call their upload speeds broadband at one <unk> per second so basically if you are at home trying to upload some photos to facebook or anything to the cloud ever
you'd be doing that at speeds ten times slower than the <unk> four g cellphone connection set it and forget it cause it's gonna take all night
another speed question is so controversial that even though pew is using the twenty-five <unk> per second speed guideline which is set by the federal communications commission network congestion usually means actual speeds are nowhere near that fast
and again a four g phone connection is faster than that on the best providers
it is such a big discrepancy that while pew says <unk> million americans don't have broadband microsoft put out its own map of high-speed internet access back in april
it said the real number of people without appropriately fast internet access for today's economy is more like a <unk> million in the united states alone
i'm molly wood and that's marketplace tech
this is a p m
let's take a break from real life for a moment to visit the somewhat near future on t v
although i have to warn you that's kinda dark too
from american public media this is marketplace tech de <unk> the digital economy i'm molly wood
the b b c h b o show years and years combines the politics economy and tech of twenty nineteen and imagines how it all might evolve over the next fifteen years
emma thompson is in it as a celebrity british politician with autocratic <unk> but mainly the show follows a family as they deal with the world changing around them
russell t davies created and wrote years and years he's also worked on shows doctor who <unk> and created queer as folk
he said the tech in years and years is like life it's complicated
show good and bad i think some of the saddest moments is is you you have a world war being announced on television and the little five <unk> kids just sit and staring into their phones playing their games
so yes there's bad stuff but that's very easy to talk about and yet there's very very good stuff i tell you actually when i made the choice to center this around a family
that came from one of the good sides of current tech which is very simply the whatsapp group i'm one of three kids and two sisters have two kids each we're a nice family we all like each other we get along
but up until a couple of years ago as my nieces have grown up two three years ago i would have texted them twice a year happy birthday and merry christmas now oh my god i went out the other night and i came back to the whatsapp group <unk> messages
because someone had cooked a <unk> with <unk> squash so yes there's good stuff if you choose either good or either bad you're not make it right you've got to get both in there because in the end it's not the technology it's it's the people
well it's great because some of the tech feels really immediate like a <unk> that projects a holographic sort of snapchat filter for your face that everyone can see in the physical world it's futuristic but it's also completely realistic
yes yes i think if that was invented tomorrow we'd all go and buy one i mean i find those filters fascinating
sends each other photos of themselves looking like a dog
rash of instagram filters like what dog are you or what cake are you i'm certainly a <unk> but i love those filters and i'm fascinated by the way we love those filters
and so the moment someone <unk> a filter you can see in the real world not just on your phone oh my god i would be <unk> you from my palace on the moon
do you have conflicting you know feelings about tech or is it like so many things where it just reflects the real world
yeah it's interesting ah i think it's both i think i think you have to be entertaining but entertaining doesn't mean being <unk> or <unk> um i think i'm getting older i think my stuff is full of warnings now to be honest it's funny now i'm in the middle of an edit of my next drama
h b o max over there which is about the aids crisis of the nineteen eighties
i've just watched an edit of an episode warning about viruses and we step out of our front doors and there's a virus on the loose it's you can't learn those lessons from history enough strangely what a world
i was telling people that i'm taking a little bit of comfort in a darker timeline like there is something comforting about the passage of time right like you fast forward in these episodes and increasingly terrible things happen but also
people are still living their normal lives talk to me about the sense of perspective
yes that's right i mean it's it was quite a hard show to sell initially with its concept of moving forward in time and every episode moves forward a year um but actually i sat there saying
been questioned about <unk> times
do you know what else moves forward a year in every episode <unk> abbey
and so did upstairs downstairs many years ago it's actually not a form of drama i've invented it's simply that this drama is going to the future ah by a year every episode that had people scared but in terms of drama in terms of how the characters are getting on who loves who
who's going out with who who's cross with who who loves who to take yearly jumps in there it's a very simple dramatic device so um
i knew that would work i had the the confidence of those those <unk> to say this will work and um
and it was to get sort of creep into the story which which is
in in societies when dictators arise or where huge changes are made and and where society might swing from left to right or right to left it doesn't happen overnight that's why i wanted
what ends up as like a <unk> span on the show is is to show show these things slowly creeping up on you and actually you're more concerned with having a tea or or falling in love
or or having a divorce that's actually the stuff the meat and drink of your life while the bigger shadows are falling on you unseen so i needed that stretch to show the small picture of people living within a bigger picture
so episode six introduces a virus and with the <unk> happening right now i wonder is that something you would have done differently
in the show was that just one of the many serve things going on in the future
it's interesting cause cause actually it comes up in episode six as as a means of isolating people within the story ah to to be honest um now i'm seeing a virus like this in action
it it would have dominated episode six too much it's amazing how it dominates ah every conversation now and episode six as a drama not not as a document of the real world but as a drama has stories to wrap up
we need to know
whether lovers will be reunited whether marriages will stay together so it's very interesting now that i thought think that's i've had done a lot of research into viruses and what would happen so i kind of you know i knew i knew the differences between <unk> and pandemics
but i chose the background it and um this is a separate drama in itself really my goodness this is some strange days again just keep getting <unk> what did we used to talk about in two thousand and six what what did we talk about can you remember interest rates
cows and cattle what did we talk about guinea pigs i don't know
i can't remember what we talked about two weeks ago even i mean do you feel anxious like when you reach inside creatively and and pull out
what in some ways it's like the worst case scenario that we're imagining our brains and put them on screen does that make you anxious
ah talking about my my family that lovely family i was just describing one of my nieces has just had twins that's one year ago ah lovely lovely baby twins and um and that makes me anxious i look at them thinking um
you know i do believe in global warming i do believe we're in trouble um i do believe that as a result the political situations i think that the the the heating up of our political situation is tied into global warming
on a vast scale that's very ah you for the first time in my life i feel for little kids thinking i'm not sure you'll have a better world i'm not sure at all you will so i have got anxiety and and as a writer that is bound to come out in my work
i do have to say that years and years does have a happy ending <unk> ending sort of <unk> but it is a happy ending because i also believe in that i also i think um real life could be disastrous enough when you're writing fiction you should reach for a happy ending
because it's hard work ah happy endings are tough to find and and miserable endings are easy so um i try to look for hope in it and i do have hope in people actually that um
we are great survivors and great thinkers and actually i think most people are nice i think people are fundamentally nice that word we're not allowed to use nice because it seems like a bland word but i think it's a beautiful word people are nice
i have to hope that our <unk> prevails
russell t davies created and wrote years and years
for some related links if you hadn't heard of years and years like me you are really not alone it did show up on a bunch of end of twenty nineteen lists as some of the year's best t v
and <unk> <unk> guide to the galaxy had a piece from last month about discovering the show and how great the characters and the technology are you'll find a link to that on our website marketplace tech dot org
and here's what else we're watching in tech tech stocks have been the beating heart of the stock market for quite a stretch now but the famous five facebook amazon apple microsoft and alphabet
lost a combined four hundred billion dollars on thursday as wall street had its worst day since nineteen <unk> on the plus side the founder of <unk> the chinese manufacturer that makes much of apple's components
said it was coming back online faster than expected after being closed due to the coronavirus outbreak as more and more people start to work from home we are keeping an eye on what's happening with internet connections and i t support
we'll have more on that next week but in italy bloomberg reports that <unk> national internet network has seen a two-thirds increase in traffic and that with the country's schools closed
and with the country's schools close apparently a lot of that traffic is coming from people playing the multiplayer games <unk> and call of duty
senior editor robin <unk> our engineer we have production help from <unk> man records this week
and like a lot of you we were all working remotely for part of this week and everybody did fantastic we're gonna be hearing a lot more about how to work from home in the coming weeks
here are some quick <unk> and <unk> for zoom meetings based on what i am hearing from some work places do mute your microphone and wear a shirt do not change your background to funny things while the boss is talking because you got bored
don't try to get a private tour of people's bedrooms and don't conduct your meeting while lying on the couch it's still work people it's still work
i'm molly wood and that's marketplace tech have a safe and healthy weekend or as i thought i put on twitter

whether you're giving for the first time or renewing your support this is a deal you don't wanna miss and it ends this week head over to marketplace dot org to get your shirt as a special gift with your donation today and thank you
welcome to the eight thousand hours podcast this interview with david <unk> is a bit unusual and that was actually recorded two years ago
we will considering a starting podcast back then and i recorded this trial episode with my colleague jess <unk> but ultimately we didn't have the time to go on ahead with the project but i thought why not dig it up and release it now
david <unk> is a <unk> at the university of cambridge and something of an academic celebrity in the u k
part of his role is to improve the public understanding of risk especially everyday risks we face like getting cancer or dying in a car crash as a result he's regularly in the media explaining the numbers in the news
trying to assist both ordinary people and politicians to focus on the most important risks that confront us and avoid being distracted by flashy risks that perhaps don't actually have that much impact
to help make sense of the uncertainties we face in life he's had to invent concepts like the micro life or a thirty minute change in life expectancy
we gave him a call because we wanted to learn weather he thought a lifetime of work had actually made that much difference to the world enjoy
here at the center for effective altruism we're interested in finding ways to compare what it means to do good and to figure out which ways of doing good do the most good so we ask question like which charity should you donate to if you want to help as many people as possible
what careers should you follow if you want to improve the world and which cause areas have the largest impact these are the sorts of questions that we think it really important to get clear so you know how you can make a real difference
to help us answer some of these questions we're joined by professor david <unk> the <unk> professor for the public understanding of risk at cambridge university professor <unk> spent much of his life trying to improve public understanding of statistics science and risk in ordinary life
he regularly appears in the u k media and writes on his blog understanding uncertainly it's great to have you with us today david
hi
so we've got so many things we'd like to talk about ah we'll see how far we get but first tell us a bit about your who you are and your position
yeah yeah i've got a strange job really i'm in the <unk> department at cambridge and i teach statistics to the undergraduates but i'm actually funded by a hedge fund <unk> capital management and and that much in order to improve
the public understanding of <unk> and risk and so ah what i've done since i've had that job for the last eight years is i suppose to try to join the general community of people who are
trying to improve the way numbers in particular are discussed in society
so what kinds of questions do you research and what outreach do you do to help the public understand numbers and uncertainly better
well i get asked to do a huge amount of stuff i suppose helping in ah various agencies communicating risk um you know about certain cancer risk about the risk of the the the screening for example risks and benefits of screening i i um my background is in medical statistics
so that's what i get to do quite a lot but i've done ah t v programs about climate change i've done ah radio stuff about um you know all sorts of threats to society from fukushima and and so on
and everything to do with and trying to get a handle on you know what are the important threats to to us individually and what would why my how we might go to make comparisons between between them so
um i i m very interested in rather than the great global existential risks so i'm more interested in the things that affect us all individually about how we eat or exercise and transport and so on
so yeah one of the things that i find very interesting in this area is that there's a lot of evidence that people tend to be very poor at estimating lots of different probabilities and so end up
<unk> the scale of the some problems of risk that they face and <unk> others um from your experience what kinds of problems do you think that people tend to be most prone to <unk> or underestimate and get wrong in very harmful ways
well the the there's been a lot of research on this by psychologists as you know and and it was when we talk about people i always include myself in this
you know i'm a subject to the whims my emotional gut reactions as much as anybody else so i m not making any claim about some superior knowledge and <unk> compared with everybody else because
we just know that the way we respond to things ah you know to simplify you know we can think in two different ways we can respond with our guts or we can try to engage our brain and think slowly about stuff
and and this so relevant when it comes to risk and ah particularly this idea the what what what's available to us is availability heuristic is very strong that
what we hear in the news we we hear about ebola we hear about terrorism we hear about you know the latest ah threats that might ah that might be in what we need some way we travel and we get very concerned about this well there's a plane crash or whatever
and because that's what's in the news that's what's is available to us so you know this what so prominent but of course so many of these risks are actually very small indeed this is not a threat to us particular at all
and and the things that are much more familiar we don't hear much of you know for example just in heart disease cancer all the other stuff that we get and largely the amount of that is because of the way we live our lack of exercise our <unk> diet
and so on of course is people get a bit bored with that because and and don't get so concerned about it
do you feel you've had any success improving public understanding of risks and getting people to focus on the stuff that really matters
oh i don't know it's right from asia i mean ah it'd be great to think so and ah yeah i've been involved in some good projects with me i'm proud of for example the redesign the cancer screening <unk> in the u k which ah present the benefits and risks
cancer screening in a in a very balanced way they they ah hugely <unk> it innovate it is that they don't actually recommend people go for screening they they just say these are the possible benefits
these are the possible harms make up your own mind and i i believe that's the right way to go about communicating risk is not to say oh you've got to watch you've got to watch out this is terrible say well if you do this this might happen or it might not happen
and weigh it up and and actually you may give people credit for some intelligence which i think people basically are don't think people are so stupid but i'm proud of is being part of a general community that's very strong in britain to do with public engagement in science
and
which i'm just the small part of that because it covers the materials on the radio stuff on television stuff in in ah some newspapers and in various agencies for example the statistics authority
which is just trying to take a much more critical attitude to the way that numbers and evidence are used in society and i think it's it works in in britain we're rather good compared with most people about
we don't have these massive fears of of vaccinations of nuclear power of of even g m <unk> and and so i i i think this is a sign that we in this country have developed quite a good ah public engagement with science community
yeah i was actually gonna ask you about um what potential you think there is for young people who want to have an impact on their career going into a career path similar to your own and trying to get into public outreach and engagement to um
to have a broader impact rather than necessarily just doing research and academia so ah how hard do you think it is to do this kind of thing and is it it sounds like this is definitely something you wish more academics did work on um
absolutely i mean i i really came to it quite late as as a real part of my career as i said again because a philanthropist and in a hedge fund and that provided the funding to be able to do this full time
but i was doing some before as part of my job and i increasingly feel that its ah actually a duty of academics who after all are publicly funded for a certain proportion of them to really spend some time on public engagement it doesn't suit everybody
not everybody at all although everybody should have a website explaining what they do and ah and that they should be ah also supported and there should be incentives within the career structure for academics to do this
i'm quite pleased in cambridge for example when we're looking at promotion of people their public engagement is taken very seriously indeed it is something i i i strongly support so it's not everybody but i think it is a very important thing for academics to do
and as they're doing their work it was in whatever area it has a relevance to society and it can ah potentially
improve society and they should be working on it
i i personally think statistics is a particularly important area for improvement of society and i feel this very strongly and many <unk> do um in terms of public engagement
the royal statistical society has now got an initiative of training up statistics ambassadors young <unk> who ah who want to do this who really want to get out there and communicate the importance of their work and try to improve the way things are done with numbers and evidence
um i think this is so exciting such fun
so a lot of young people we meet are thinking of going into academia do feel like that's a a good place to be to have a big impact in the world of course there are also some <unk> that you might ah be aware of from your experience of being in academia
yes yeah i'm not i wouldn't necessarily say you know to recommend yes you really should go into academia and you know it doesn't suit everybody and and frankly when did i started it's quite yeah it is very tough now
ah ah ah in most careers there seems to be a lot more pressures on than there used to be so it's quite can be quite a tough call i think but there is potential to do a lot of good stuff and you know people work people i work with and know in other areas whether they're working in
natural natural um you know natural threats natural disasters when they're working in <unk> whether they're working any area and plant sciences whatever are a really dedicated to trying to improve
a lot of the world and i'm i'm so impressed by the dedication but it is a tough job and you don't necessarily see in this sort of push to the other publish the work you've got to do all this you've got to go through all the seventh
all this business in order to build one's career it doesn't necessarily appear at first that you're actually doing a great and good in what you do very little of it you can see a direct impact however as i know that i'm um you know what's very good about it is that
it it is it's building a lot of <unk> skills that you can use um i find that in my statistical skills for example are in a massive demand and by all sorts of agencies um i could point in particular to the
importance of the millennial development goals and the sustainable development goals which are which are um
well which are replacing them in which they sort of monitoring of the um state of of of the welfare in different countries around the world has become absolutely vital and just being able to measure things and know what's going on and ah
to develop good ways to do surveys actually look at what works and how how you can um improve these measures it is has become enormously vital enormously important so i i think um well again i'm coming back to i think statistics is
particularly valuable area to go into
yeah absolutely and just a little bit more broadly the key idea behind effective altruism is that we want to try and figure out which altruistic activities which charities which career paths which causes do the most goods um we think that being able to
measure things or at least trying to measure things is incredibly valuable in making progress on those questions but obviously these are many of these questions are incredibly difficult to answer so a common criticism that we often get is people saying something like
oh it's impossible to figure out which charities or careers do the most good so you're wasting your tough time trying and you should just go with your gut or you know help personal causes um what do you think of this kind of objection and do you think there's anything to it um
you know concern about there being too much uncertainty um you know we often respond by saying that you know it doesn't mean that we shouldn't try and estimating this clearly the best we have but yeah what are your thoughts on this challenge
i mean this is not a a comment that's um just restricted to ah the area that you're talking about it happens all the time used to happen in healthcare it is said oh you can't put a value on a human life
um we've just go to do all we can to do good and we have to just go with our guts essentially no that this that view now certainly in the u k has been completely discredited you can put a value on a human life we do all the time
i'm sure everyone would agree that
not sure everyone you can agree and of course
but you have to
but nice for example has been doing this for over a decade
putting the value on the marginal benefit of particular healthcare intervention and assessing what should be supported under national health service according to reach all the criteria and we know this is not perfect we know this does not measure everything
but it's explicit it's transparent and they've done their best and i think it's a massive success and a huge example for other countries how you can go about it now we know it is a it's never perfect it's never perfect
but because people then trying to take that approach which i think has been extremely beneficial in healthcare and move it into all other areas now how can you do it so people are trying to do it with the environment and how can we measure the value of a tree well people are trying to measure the value of a tree
and i know what the value of a <unk> worth and it's quite a lot but
working out all these different trying to measure the benefit of a or how the sustainable environment et cetera what's the value of a species what's the value of this
i mean i mean it seems it's it's too easy to sit back and say oh you can't do it you can't measure that well well you can have a good go you can have a good go so as you say it's always a balance between trying your best realizing you're never gonna be able to do it
but not to be put off having a good go so it it's like a lot of things we do in statistics trying to measure things trying to model things that we always know what we do is inadequate but that doesn't mean we can't do useful things
can you tell us a bit more about nice and how they prioritized health treatments within the united kingdom
yeah i mean that's something i've worked on a medical <unk> i would be in a huge support of nice and essentially um what they what they do is when they decide whether decide to have a new vaccine or whether decide to have a new ah recommend ah
so for drugs to be paid for under the n h s for example they will look at what is the expected benefit of that of that intervention and what's the expected cost and then they look at how much it's gonna cost to
and ah provide an extra or they call it <unk> a quality adjusted life year so one year of life it's discounted if it's poor quality you will you will you will you will discount it it won't be worth a whole year and essentially they can make a comparison
and they look if something comes in less than twenty thousand pounds of <unk> ah just when they just paid for you know just yep fine we'll pay for it under the n h s if it's more than about thirty thousand then they really try
we don't want to pay for this
and try to go back to the drug company to <unk> a price for example between twenty thousand and thirty thousand wow you know that's that's more in the gray zone so and this has been enormously beneficial partly
in order to go back to drug companies and get them to reduce their prices but um and also to see that some interventions for example cancer screening come in extremely cheap they're just worth doing it it also means you have to be explicit for example in how much you value the future
rather than the present because they put in a discount rate currently three and a half percent and now that means that ah ah a year of life in twenty-five years time for example is only worth about half what a year of life now is worth and and that's taken into account
and now that that of course is controversial and if we are talking about big policy decisions for example about climate change that's far too big a discount rate we wouldn't care less about the world in hundred years time if we used that discount rate so in different areas
you might be wanting to use a different <unk> rate but these are taking economic ideas and moving them into very human decisions
and i think they are enormously helpful and illuminating but they're never perfect
yeah i've actually written an article with ah professor toby <unk> about why we shouldn't discount health even though we should discount financial returns about why why it's appropriate in one case and not in the other so we'll put up a link to that ah on the website ah so
a lot of people who are planning out their careers they feel just overwhelmed by uncertainty they they don't know how much they're gonna earn in one career or what's the chances of getting into academia or being elected to parliament
ah how do you think people ought to make decisions ah when they're just surrounded by so much uncertainty
well i mean you could say that we're always surrounded about this again this is common to everything we do we never know what's gonna happen in the future which is great people don't don't wanna know what's gonna to happen in the future people don't even know what what they want what they're gonna get for christmas let alone what's gonna happen for the rest of their lives
and so um the this is just a common problem and we need to distinguish what we might call risk and uncertainty risk is when it's a very well defined problem there's short term issues and buying lottery tickets when you know what the chances are
and then we can also take a rational approach when we're dealing with deeper uncertainty when really are not even sure what the options are of how our lives might develop then um it's very difficult to take a completely formal approach and say um i wouldn't
try to say oh we should be able to do all this mathematically at all however the basics of <unk> ideas of thinking through a rational decision are still very valuable because you think of you know what are the options available
what are the possibilities and ah you know what are the possible consequences of what i might do now that's always inadequate you're never gonna be able to think about the thing and however by thinking through that some things might come immediately apparent some immediate rankings of
what is preferable and not preferable might become apparent um and otherwise um you um um we might need to fall back and think on on broader strategies for making decisions in the face of
what we call deeper uncertainty now this is a deeply contested area and when governments make policies ah very often they're in these situations where they they can't even think of all the things that might happen so the they're in the situation of deeper uncertainty
and people have tested various ways to go about it the first thing is to not to think that you can optimize you can't be perfect you you cannot be perfect so there are sort of suggestions of people make in terms of general decision-making in these contexts
so to do with flexibility and resilience so you want to be you want you don't want to commit yourself to something you're not gonna be able to change because you can't predict everything that's gonna happen so you build in flexibility and <unk> to your decision
and that's the same in any business any government any any project at all the other thing is building resilience in which you are are essentially can cope with the unexpected and things and that means both and you know the possibility of really good things happening
as well as the possibility of really bad things happening that you are making sure that you haven't put all your eggs in one basket essentially so if something goes wrong you haven't completely gone up a total blind alley that you can't <unk>
which means operating from a basis ah most robust basis as possible so it means not trying to optimize the single path but building in <unk> which means yeah um i think in in terms of career of course building in
<unk> skills you're gonna be able to use in a variety of circumstances so i think these are standard tactics to respond to deeper uncertainty and which can be used in any in any situation
yeah that's definitely something that the organization eight thousand hours to advise people on you know how to have a big impact with a career is really focus on is specially early in your career like keep your options open choose things that are robust under you know in a lot of different possible things happening
one other question that we find we come up against a fair amount in thinking about careers and charities and all kinds of things is you know how do you go about choosing between a small chance of some really huge outcome like you know saving the world from a pandemic that kills millions
against some high probability of a very moderate or a more moderate outcome sooner helping people in your like of community um this seems like a very difficult thing to deal with do you have any thoughts on how people can go about making these kinds of decisions
yeah very difficult but again these are common decisions in our in always in our lives do we go for the high risk option or or the safer or the safer option and i i personally think that
actually a a mixed strategy is something that businesses i think would recommend although that's not what i do i'm not involved in in any investment decisions but often when i think people take ah an idea of portfolio
of ah ah ah risk taking because these are all risks you can't guarantee with anything that you do and these are all risks and so you that might have a certain amount invested in rather safe things with a safe return you're pretty sure
that what you're gonna do is going to have a reasonable return and that you really can predict the consequences of what you're what you're using your career or your money for what you're getting for ah on the other hand on more speculative
ah you you might be supporting something that actually might not come to now come to anything either because the solution it's promising
and won't work or the threat won't arise in the first place so um i i i think actually a mixed strategy in these circumstances again you know i wouldn't want to just put all the eggs in one basket so it's just
that wouldn't be appropriate i also personally feel that um that this is completely my personal reaction that i give is that um i i quite like a mixed strategy in which some of things are ah the the bigger
slightly anonymous
trying to where you you're all giving money
large organization is doing something which um is contributing in a pro probably fairly predictable way to to to um um improving things with people versus you know the more personal ones where you do have the personal
contact and and you might get slightly more some emotional feedback from them partly because they might encourage you to perhaps take on a more ah ah the feedback from the altruism might encourage you to take on a bigger after all
a a bigger commitment to the future
so there are various way of thinking about how to quantify the risks of possible gains associated with an activity can you explain what a micro mode or a micro life is
oh yeah yeah these are units that well i invented the micro life someone else invented the <unk> it's just it's just a way of trying to get a common scale for you know particularly because a <unk> is acute risks things that might kill you on the spot but otherwise you're healthy
and it's a one in a million chance of dying because of an action you might take so <unk> or something is approximately seven to ten <unk> and and then micro life which is something to do with chronic risks which is the risk of
um i think we can start on quite interesting which is ah bad lifestyle yeah lack of exercise or smoking or drinking or and yeah bad diet whatever ah which isn't gonna kill you on the spot um but
will ah short his life likely to shorten your life definitely not definitely at all um maybe not but probably will and so it's a reduction of half an hour in the life expectancy i find these quite useful because it enables you to compare all these different
things like diet and smoking and ah exercise and things like and and makes me for example but you know smoking is where you you know the biggest return or the biggest you know um in terms of not smoking but the huge biggest return and ah
drinking at low doses well actually it doesn't make much difference
huge a huge concern unless you're really <unk> it down um but exercise again i think it is extremely important and and <unk> important and and
it it just gives you a feeling of what's you know where the um you know where the priorities are which of course it's all a bit obvious that the priorities that people do in public health but it makes you slightly <unk> about um other things that people might be really concerned
so these these concept were invented to help people get a better understanding and make better decisions do you think that we could invent ah new concepts to help ah people think about how they can do more good in the world
yeah ah ah you know a <unk>
it's difficult i mean the <unk> is a start is a good one if you're really if you're if your area of cause is is to do with saving lives and improving health and lethal risk to the people then <unk> is a good one it's already established you can look at how many
so how many years of life are you gonna gain for and from your intervention and and and we know that you know if you're giving money for to some particular charities
promote
you know they're extremely cost effective in that way
it's more difficult if you have the broader idea for example of of of supporting education of of preserving the environment actual environment and so on quite hard to put a a number on that um within a within a particular area cause
ah cause then you might be able to do it but provide having metrics that
go right across different areas
is is difficult and i know that you know people criticize that
attempts to do
i still think it's worth trying to do i mean and people struggling to do this within
within the within environment and so on i don't think i've got any great idea to be honest um to ah i mean one possibility of course is
is looking at with general measures of well-being which again people are doing it's measured by national governments now to try to measure well-being um in terms of how people feel about the about they're lives and and
so general well-being <unk> which are not just i mean you know health related or length of life related and i think ah have got have got great potential but it's not gonna right you're not you're not gonna be able to get the perfect measure on them
so people are often asked you know how would you rate ah how good your life is going from ah one to ten you know typically they give answers between six and eight at least in the u k
maybe we could have a micro happy which should be something as good as moving someone from six to seven or seven to eight on this welfare scale
yeah yeah yeah no i'm yes yeah yeah exactly ah ah ah i think that no the scales um well actually i find them very revealing when people do measure them particular cross culture as you said
everyone says seven
maybe cause i like number seven but it also <unk> this idea why it's not bad ah you know
mustn't grumble
you know could be better but mustn't grumble you know so slightly british stoic attitude so um i think it's almost predictable what people are gonna respond but i find for example the age distribution of these responses and how the age distribution varies across cultures
extremely interesting and um the idea of um you know whether one could move
you know ah groups of people ah on that scale and would be very important and when i think of little charities and some of the ones i i i give to the you know
which are are not directly i don't think anyone could actually make people live longer but um you'd hope to would improve people's well-being and sense of happiness and considerably
yeah it is a fascinating area of a research and and there are significant international differences so i think in the u k and america and australia people do tend to give seven or maybe eight if they're feeling particularly good but in south america people are just for some reason more exuberant
and ah tend to often give <unk> ah even even when they're relatively poor ah but by contrast in ah eastern europe and eastern asia like japan and china people tend to give relatively low scores relative to how life they well seems to seems to be going from the outside
yeah yeah yeah no no people in different cultures i think in africa they're even lower people are very
yeah there are some countries that where the average is as low as four out of ten which may maybe half of people are giving less than four which is ah a bit unfortunate
for the gain i mean these are i they are they're very culturally and i think specific and so and but i think what i want to see is relative changes relative changes perhaps you know compared with
the average in that in that community that one would for you and um you can't just get everyone up to eight or whatever i mean there are very different cultural attitudes to do with i think that are reflected in those questions
yeah so by trying to estimate risks or the size of problems in this quantitative way do you think we risk being biased against approaches that are harder to quantify
yeah i think it always is a problem that people start believing you know that the model the measure which is a only a very inadequate thing starts trying to starts becoming the thing that you are in fact then trying to um you know you're focused on
to the detriment of all others you mean and and there's a real problem with over you know <unk> an any activity you know pretending that you can measure the benefits of everything
academic world of course is a and
real example of that where people start getting obsessed with impact factors and nonsense like that so and there's a ah ah real danger with with um believing these things too much and also in time
i think we should have a damn good go at trying to do it and just because something is is difficult and cannot be done perfectly doesn't mean that you can't at least have a have a stab at it because because you may
you know often
these things might can get really clear around things you know the great precision might not be required in order to determine that actually this is not an not an effective use of the sources compared with incidences
yeah and i think that rather than giving us a perfect answer to all questions using you know models and looking at different factors can as you say just help you to identify like clear differences or areas where you need to get more information because you just have no idea how to factor that in all
so i must say it can definitely be very useful um finally just to what extent do you think that the average person can benefit from a better understanding of statistics learning more statistics you know either in their everyday lives or in being more effective as <unk>
um and to what extent do you think i guess relating back to the past question it could potentially limit us
yeah i think i think um yeah of course i do of course i'd say this wouldn't i um but yeah i do believe that people would benefit from having them a greater idea of stats and measurement and number and quantity
and and the <unk> of that as well because the point about understanding statistics is both understanding their strength and their weaknesses the two are absolutely hand in hand and what people tend to do at the moment they're not you know i suppose not confident
with with with numbers and how they are constructed because they are in their whole are always constructed someone has chosen what to measure and the there is they tend to either accept them as if they're god given truth and that's you know the number and that's so vital
for you and that is it that's what we're looking for or reject them out of hand oh you can't put numbers
damn lies and statistics and this is nonsense and those two extreme views both equally idiotic
but if you've got a slightly more nuanced view you'll realize that statistics numbers and measurement are an incredibly valuable tool but they're they're just a tool and they they have their <unk> and <unk> so ah they both need to be
teach and understand the strength and the limitations and what i mean i'm involved in a number of educational projects in in which we're trying to do just that
so it's ah really a matter of trying to ah assign the appropriate weight to each different kind of evidence or each different piece of evidence that comes your way
i think i mean in the end what statistics is is to do with its quantitative evidence that's what that's what they want that the talking about and and evidence can be good or bad or you know a long whole scale it's not a true or false
um it's just evidence and we are trying to weigh up our evidence and which we do all the time in our lives we do this but you know our guts tend to be ah bit <unk> when it comes to weighing up evidence
too influenced by certain salient things that would attract our attention and so as she's standing back and trying to be a bit cooler about weighing up evidence i think it's a really valuable ah thing to try to do in all areas of life it doesn't matter what
yeah absolutely which is not to say that you should completely discount that gut feeling but often just supplement it with some extra evidence source statistics
like my guts
i i don't trust them a bit but i still you know go with them
yeah i think that's about all we've got time for now but thanks so much david um this has been very informative um really interesting
okay thanks very much
alright if you'd like to hear more from professor <unk> <unk> then you can find his blog at understanding uncertainty online and he's also often on the radio in the u k in particular on more or less on b b c four
hi i'm rob director of research at eighty thousand hours today i'm speaking with miles <unk> research fellow at the university of <unk> future of humanity institute
he studies the social implications surrounding the development of new tech technologies and has a particular interest in artificial general intelligence that is an a i system that could do most or all of the tasks humans could do
<unk> research has been supported by the national science foundation the bipartisan policy center and the future of life institute thanks for making time to talk to us today miles
thanks for having me
so first up maybe just tell us a bit about your background and what questions you're looking into at the moment
sure ah so i used to work on energy policy ah when i was living in washington d c and i've gradually moved into a i policy over the past few years because it seems like it is more of a neglected area and could have a very large impact
ah so i recently started at the future of humanity institute and i'm also <unk> finishing up my p h d in human and social dimensions of science and technology at arizona state university
ah so in both capacities i am ah interested in what sorts of methods would be useful for thinking about a i in a rigorous way and particularly the uncertainty of possible futures surrounding a i
ah and i have a few more specific interests such as openness and artificial intelligence and the risks related to bad actors
okay um so are you trying to predict what's gonna happen and when and what sort of effects it will have
ah so not necessarily predict per se but at least understand what's plausible i think that it's very difficult to predict with any ah high confidence what's gonna happen and when
but understanding for example what sorts of ah actions people could carry out with a i systems today or in the foreseeable future in different domains like cyber security ah ah
and information operations ah the production of fake news automatically and autonomous drones and so forth
i think understanding the security landscape of those sorts of things doesn't necessarily require a very detailed forecast of when exactly ah something will occur so much as understanding what's technologically possible ah given near term trends
ah yeah you don't necessarily have to say this is when the ah this particular accident or malicious behavior will occur but just ah that these are the sorts of risks that we need to be prepared for
right right does that bring you into contact with ah with organizations that are developing a i's like like google
yeah yeah absolutely so those organizations have an interest in ah making sure that a i is ah as beneficial as possible
keenly aware of the fact that they can be <unk> and that there might be ah accident risks associated with them
so for example i held a workshop ah fairly recently on the ah connection between bad actors and a i and ah what sorts of bad actors we might be concerned about in this space and we had some participation from some of those groups
right right what kinds of bad actors are you thinking of
ah i think there ah you can look at it from a number of different perspectives so depending on the domain that you're interested in ah you might end up with different sorts of actors
so in the case of ah physical harm associated with a i you might look at autonomous weapons ah and the <unk> of consumer drones and in that case it's something that would be particularly appealing to state actors as well as terrorists
we're already seeing the <unk> of consumer drones though without much autonomy if any in the case of isis overseas
so ah there are cases like that where we can foresee that particular ah groups when given more advanced capabilities such as ah higher baseline levels of autonomy in consumer drones
ah would like ah would would be able to and would like to carry out ah damage on a larger scale
ah but in other cases it's less clear for example ah there are concerns around mass surveillance and it's often not totally clear whether one should be more concerned about ah states or corporations
ah depending on what sorts of risk you're concerned about for example um corporations ah currently have a lot of data on people and
there's there have been a lot of concerns raised about ah the use of a i to make decisions that have critical impacts on people's lives
such as denying loans ah and ah in court decisions and so forth ah that are being informed by often not very transparent algorithms
so those those are some concerns but there's also a potentially different class of concerns around ah ah authoritarian states using a i for ah oppression
so it's ah i think there's a range of risks but generally speaking ah there's going to be a study increase in the floor of the skill level as these ah a i technologies diffuse
that is there will be more and more ah capabilities available to people at the bottom of the scale that is individuals as well as people with more access to computing power ah money and data at the higher end
so ah it's not totally clear how to think about that because on the one hand you might expect that
ah the the biggest actors are the most concerning because they have the most ah skill and ah resources but on the other hand they also are sometimes in the case of democratic governments
ah held accountable to citizens and in the case of corporations held accountable to stakeholders you might also think that you would be more concerned about individual ah rogue actors
so ah ah that's an issue i'm still trying to think through in the in the context of the report that i'm writing based on that workshop
right since people often distinguish between ah the short term ah risks from a i like self driving cars not working properly or algorithmic bias
and then the longer term concerns of what we're gonna do once artificial intelligence is ah as smart as humans or potentially ah much much more intelligent which one of those do you spend more time working on
i try to focus on issues that ah span different time horizons so i think that a i and security is something that we're already seeing some early instances of today
so it's already being used for detection of ah cyber threats for example and the production of vulnerabilities in software there's a lot of ah research going on
which an example being the <unk> grant cyber ah cyber grant challenge recently where there's automated hacking ah and automated defense
ah so there's already stuff happening on the front of a i and security as well as the economics of a i and so and ah issues surrounding privacy
but ah it's it's not totally clear whether the issues in the future will just be ah straightforward extensions of those or whether there will be <unk> different
think it's important to think about what's happening today ah and imagine how it might progressively develop into a more extreme future as well as to think about possible <unk> when a i ah progresses more quickly
right right so i should say this point um that ah we have a profile up on our website about the um the the potential <unk> and downsides of artificial intelligence so we go through ah all all of the basics
and miles you have a forthcoming guide to ah work on a i policy and strategy that ah we're gonna link to so here we're gonna try to go beyond that if you find yourself a little bit confused then potentially just go on to read one of those um one of those documents first
um so oh which policy or strategy questions do you see as most important for us to answer in order to ensure um that the development of artificial intelligence goes well rather than in a in a bad way
i think there are a lot of questions and some of the ones say was talking about earlier surrounding security and and preventing the um <unk> of a i by ah dangerous actors is one
but one ah and also other issues that have been widely discussed in the media and by academics such as accountability of algorithms transparency ah the economic impacts of a i and so forth
ah but one that i think is particularly important particularly over the long ah over the long term ah this is a case where there might be a need to think about possible <unk>
is coordination surrounding a i safety so there's been a lot of attention called to a i safety in the past few years ah and there's starting to be a lot of ah concrete and successful research on the problem of avoiding certain a i safety failure modes
like wire heading and value <unk> and so forth ah but there's been less attention paid to how do you actually ah incentivize people to act on the the best practices and the good theoretical frameworks that are developed
assuming that they will be developed and that's a a potentially big problem if there's a competitive situation between companies or between countries or both and there's an incentive to <unk> on those safety measures
so there's been a little bit of work for example ah by armstrong et al at the future of humanity institute ah looking at ah arms race type scenarios involving a i where there would be an incentive to <unk>
because you're concerned about losing the lead ah in an a i race and there might be significant ah we we don't really know what the extent will be
but there it might turn out that there are significant trade <unk> between safety and performance of a i systems so ah one might be tempted to in order to gain an advantage whether economic or military or intelligence wise ah
ramp up the capabilities of an a i system by adding more hardware adding more data adding more sensors and <unk> and so forth um but that might actually be dangerous if you don't understand the the full ah behavioral envelope of the system
so to speak and how to <unk> actors the human actors from doing that ah is a very difficult problem
so i've ah i along with others at the future of humanity institute and other different organizations have started thinking about ah what is an incentive compatible mechanism to ensure
ah the people do the right thing in that case that is to say we don't want to ask people to do something that's totally against their interests
if they actually do have an interest in developing these systems and protecting themselves militarily or otherwise ah but we also want to ensure that they're constrained in some sort of way
so one example would be ah at a range this is not necessarily for a fully <unk> out example but just to illustrate the sort of thing i'm talking about
would be some sort of arrangement between a i developers such that ah in order to gain access to the latest breakthroughs or the latest computing power
ah you would need to submit to some sort of ah safety monitoring and and ah adhere to certain best practices
ah that would create an incentive if you want to be on the cutting edge to ah to participate in those ah safety protocols so ah that's again that's not a fully worked out example
that's that's an example of the class of things that i would like to see more of the developing specific proposals for how to ensure that the right thing ah that's being developed on the technical front actually gets implemented
right ah do you look much at say what governments should be doing in this area whether there's regulations that we should be putting in place or at least preparing to put in place in future
yeah so i think that that ties in with what i was saying a little bit in that one might envision that ah as a i capabilities develop
it'll be increasingly seen as ah a matter of national security that a country be on the the leading edge i think it's a it's not super clear how to navigate that yet ah
i think there's some low hanging fruit clearly in my opinion it would be beneficial for countries to have some experts in house in their governments who actually know something about a i
and are able to deal with crises as they arise if they arise ah and to be able to think carefully about the impacts of ah ah a i on the labor force for example
ah so i think there's some low hanging fruit and some policies that have been developed for dealing with some of the near term issues but for the longer term issues
it's not super clear that we want to rush into a situation where governments are are leading this if if that would turn out to ah only <unk> the the arms race dynamics
we should be trying to avoid ah if a i is seen even more as a national security issue in an unharmed <unk> way
so i think it's incumbent on those who are thinking about the long term policy issues around a i to develop a more positive proposal that involves not just
ah you know the u s government getting involved for the purpose of accelerating ah american a i capabilities
but some more collaborative approach
yeah i suppose with with previous dangerous technologies like like nuclear weapons or chemical or biological weapons there's there's been agreements to try to um slow down their development and and deployment is that something that could potentially happen here at the international level
i think it's possible to imagine some sort of slowing down among a small number of actors
<unk> fortunate that there is a ah high concentration of ah computing power and talent and skill in a fairly small number of organizations
so there's pretty much no chance of some random person ah out competing ah you know the top organizations in a i ah in a surprising way
ah so it's possible that with with some of the top companies and nonprofits as well ah countries they could coordinate in some sort of way
ah not to postpone a i you know across society for a long period of time but at least to be cautious ah in the later stages of development and to allow time for ah mutual vetting of of safety procedures and things like that
so i think it's possible to imagine some sort of coordination but ah the the technical and the political factors interact to a large extent
but to the extent that we actually have good safety measures that are efficient and that don't introduce a lot of overhead ah computational or otherwise ah into these systems
then we'll be in a better place to actually get people to coordinate because it won't be imposing a lot of costs on them and likewise to the extent that we're able to coordinate better
it will ah we'll be in a better position actually get people to implement this ah this ah mechanisms if they do impose some performance penalties
right so so can you think of um ah like any major bits of progress we've made on a i strategy questions over the last couple of years
so the example i mentioned of ah the paper by armstrong et al ah called racing to the precipice is one example and it presented sort of a stark version of the arms race scenario
that i think you know there are reasons to be our more optimistic than ah than are presented in that paper ah because they look at only a certain ah in a set of assumptions as with any ah model
but ah more generally i think there's been progress in the development of principles and criteria for good policies in recent years so for example with the <unk> ah conference and the set of <unk> a i principles
so i think that was a good step towards developing some shared understanding around ah the need to avoid arms races and ah concerns over a i <unk> and so forth
um but ah it's i i still think that there's a lot of room for
ah progress to be made so ah there was a paper put out by the future of humanity institute ah by nick <unk> <unk> flynn and ah allan <unk> recently that ah looks at policy <unk> for the development of machine <unk>
and there's a lot of good material there but i think ah they would be the first to admit that ah we're still at the the the high level principles stage of developing these policies
so we we have a better understanding of what we want to avoid than ah than we did a few years ago and what sort of what what a ah good policy proposal would look like
but we don't yet have anything ah super actionable so i think the situation is a bit analogous to where a i safety was a few years ago
where there were ah there was starting to be an articulation of what the problem was ah with ah the book super intelligence and various other publications
and people were starting to take the problem seriously and started to have a vocabulary for what a what a solution would look like with ah value alignment ah and other terms being coined
ah but there wasn't yet any you know concrete ah research agenda and yeah subsequently there have been a lot of ah concrete research agendas
as well as technical progress on some parts of those research agendas ah with work by <unk> and <unk> and others ah leading the way
so i think that we're potentially in a similarly exciting phase on the a i policy front where we have a a decent understanding of what the problem is ah and with the example of avoiding arms races ah being you know forefront in my mind
at least but we don't yet have a concrete ah we don't have you know clear models and ah case studies that we can point to as as ways forward
so i think that's the next step is moving into more concrete proposals and ah trying to balance some of the trade <unk> that have been identified in recent papers
so it seems like excuse me seems like a lot of the latest thinking in this area um isn't written up in public yet partly because ah people don't want to <unk> their views at this point or just because it takes a long time to get papers published
ah what do you think is the best way for someone who's interested in working in the area to get up to speed on the issues
so i think um again it's somewhat analogous to the situation with um ah you know a i safety a few years ago and i think the book <unk> was a big step forward on that front in terms of having a single reference to point people to
but ah it's less clear if there's one single reference to point people to on ah a i policy issues though i'm hoping hoping that the career guide that i'm working on will be somewhat useful in that regard
another resource that comes to mind is a syllabus for a class on the global politics of a i developed by ah allan <unk> at yield and the future of humanity institute
that that's a very detailed um list of resources ah and i i ah i'm sure there'll be a link provided ah for for ah this interview somewhere ah
yeah
and yeah so i i think that's that's another set of resources it's essentially a long list of um ah you know both formal ah you know academic publications as well as things in the more gray literature
ah such as blog posts which ah is you know i think the sort of thing that you're referring to you know as things that aren't necessarily written up academically but are you know somewhat accessible but even there there's still some things like ah you know google docs that are used internally and so forth
so i think if if based on reading those sorts of things this is clearly something you're interested in then ah the obvious next step is just to get in touch with people ah who are working on these issues and and ask and you know indicate what your interests are
and there might be ah things that aren't available online that they can point you to
yeah you mentioned the <unk> statement of of principles ah do you just want to describe that
sure ah so
two years ago there was a conference on beneficial a i held in puerto rico and that led to an open an open letter on a i
ah and subsequently some investment by elon musk in the future of life institute ah which supported a lot of grants in this space
ah and i think that that led to a lot of attention to the issue and there were you know thousands of people by including a lot of a i scientists who signed onto that ah letter
and then subsequently the <unk> principles ah which were developed at a conference two years later ah this year ah at <unk> in california
developed a more ah specific set of proposals for what sorts of ah things a i scientists should be thinking about so not just you know the fact that there should be more research but also ah things like capability caution
so being attentive to ah the fact that we don't know for sure what the upper limits of a i capabilities will ah will ultimately be
and the things i mentioned about avoiding arms races and ah being concerned about ah a i <unk> more broadly so ah i think that's a good example of developing ah you know sort of a consensus view on what
ah what we want to see and what we don't want to see we want to see a i benefiting society as a whole and we don't want to see it you know ah leading to the <unk> of benefits to a small number of people or to ah large scale war or anything like that
um and ah i think it's it's encouraging to see not just that but also the development of other sets of principles ah through the <unk> and their ah effort on ethically aligned ah a i design
so so i read this this principles and they seem quite strong on paper ah do you do you think people are likely to follow through on them
ah i think i think there's somewhat of a gap between the level of abstraction ah of of the principles and concrete ah steps that people can take
so for example it's not totally clear what any individual ah can do to stop an arms race for example but ah i think it's a step in the right direction to know where where you're headed
and then ah figuring out exactly what to do about that is is the next step
yeah so ah in in your guide you suggest that people could potentially work on a i strategy and policy questions at places like google <unk> or <unk> where where artificial intelligence is actually being ah developed
um what what <unk> could you see people doing at places like that if they took a job there
yeah so so some extent people at those organizations are are doing something fairly similar to what i and my colleagues are doing ah in academia
which is thinking about what the problems are and trying to develop solutions ah i think the the benefit of being on that side of things is to ah have more direct exposure to what's happening on the ground so to speak
ah in a i development and i think that can be useful ah for developing a set of what sorts of problems are actually cropping up ah as a result of the development of capabilities that actually exist as opposed to just ones in the future
though i think it's also notable that ah people at these organizations have been very active in the efforts that i've mentioned such as ah raising attention to a i safety
which was an initiative ah that that involved people at google brain and <unk> and the concrete problems in the a i safety paper
ah and people at <unk> have been very ah influential in in calling for more a i safety work and they've been publishing ah fairly early on this matter relative to other organizations
so i think there's a lot of ah reason to think that these organizations are are playing a positive role and i think it's it would be a good place to be involved in ah sort of thought leadership on these topics
as well as doing ah direct research
and how hard it is to get a job at a place like that
i would imagine they not only have a few people working on a i strategy or policy are these extremely competitive roles
i would say they're pretty competitive ah and i think that's that's you know a general phenomenon in anything related to a i these days whether on the ah policy side or the technical side
um but i i think that this is a growth area for sure so ah if if one develops expertise in this topic ah and has something to contribute
then i think there will ultimately be opportunities available ah to you in the next few years
it's again i i wanna you know draw an analogy to a i safety where there was a lot of concern about will there be jobs in a i safety ah you know three years years ago and i think that <unk> some grad students from working in this space and
now ah the situation seems to look a bit better in that there's a fair number of advertisements for <unk> and ah people being hired at top ah top labs to work on these issues
so i think we'll probably see something pretty similar ah not necessarily becoming not competitive but ah they're being a little bit of ah <unk> over time as as there's a need for developing larger teams to work on these topics
and another path you've talked about is going into ah politics or policy roles for example as a congressional <unk> or perhaps at a think tank like the <unk> institute or the national science foundation or potentially just going into party politics in general
ah what useful things do you <unk> people could do there
yeah so i think in the same way that working at an a i lab would give you a better sense of what's ah practical on the technical front
ah working for congress or parliament or ah you know political party would give you a better sense of what's practical on the political front
so ah in addition to that developing a better intuition for the the system that you're dealing with and what the constraints are
i think it's also potentially a good way to actually influence what what's actually done by those bodies
so for example ah in ah the u s congress right now there was just recently announced an a i caucus ah to organize the discussion of ah members of congress on issues related to a i
with particular focus on issues ah related to the future of work but i think over time we'll see more ah discussion of of the longer term sorts of issues
ah that we've been talking about in in those <unk> and they would be useful to have people who are concerned about making sure that the right thing is ah is ultimately done working in those places
and able to actually act on the best ah the best current understanding developed by researchers and by practitioners
yeah so i think a big risk of going into ah politics or policy in general would be that your career progresses but you're not specifically in one of the places that ends up ah having a say in how these things go
um you just end up you know being a you know working in a in in a congressional committee that that turns out not to be that relevant ah are there any roles that that you can take early on or what can you do to position yourself well so that you don't just get <unk> in the end
i think if you intend to work in politics then you have to be somewhat <unk> about ah jobs and the ebb and flow of political opportunities so ah for example
um if you know one one congressional committee is declining in its relevance ah in in terms of a i then one should consider about ah you know jumping ship towards somewhere that's more relevant
ah so i don't think that you know ah taking one particular job will lock you in forever ah but building up some ah political capital and ah some ah human capital in that area could be useful
ah even if you ultimately want to switch to a different organization but i would push back a little bit on the idea of um you know not being relevant just because you're not at the undecided of the people
ah you're not at the at the organization where people are developing the latest a i as i as i mentioned before i think that's a very exciting opportunity ah and you know along with academia it's it's a great great place to work on these issues
but governments still play an important role in ah framing these issues and in convening discussions
for example of ah example of this would be the preparing for the future of artificial intelligence report put out by the white house office of science and technology policy last year
ah which ah you know was was the result of four workshops that brought together ah experts in a wide variety of areas in law and economics ah and a i technology and safety
and so i think ah you still have an opportunity to frame the discussion and move the ball forward even if ah you're not ah working in the latest labs
yeah so what would be some of the best places to apply to in that area
so it's it's a bit tricky to answer that in general it depends on ah factors like what your citizenship is and ah what particular policy issues you're interested in
but some ah fairly robust ah recommendations would be to ah look for ah for for for a particular class of people that have technical backgrounds
one area to look at would be triple a s <unk> so ah the american association for the advancement of science has a ah fellowship program
where they essentially put people in ah <unk> in organizations like congress and ah the executive branch where they can ah implement some of ah some they can you know draw on their technical experience
some someone with a background in a i would probably end up in an a i relevant organization so i have heard a lot of good things about that being a good good way to develop career capital and experience and understanding of how the political system works
ah but that's not necessarily you know going to result in being in the exact right location for ah for you know solving a i policy problems the next few months
i think it's really hard to say where where that would be ah or even if there is such a place because i think we're still
despite all the progress that's being made in a relatively early stage so ah there isn't even yet a recommendation ah there isn't even yet a nomination for the director of the office of science and technology policy in the white house
so ah otherwise i would say that that is a good place to to go um so ah likewise we don't really know what the agenda of the trump administration is on the a i front
ah and there's a lot of um there's a lot of discussion but not much ah institution building ah in in governments at the moment so ah it's hard for me to answer that in general
but i think getting experience is a pretty robust thing to do
right right um so situation that i i encounter reasonably often is i meet someone who's really smart who is very interested in this topic who might be able to make a great contribution
but at the moment um there aren't that many groups that are hiring for these roles ah you're at the future of humanity institute and i guess there's also the future of life institute um but there aren't that many places that someone ah can potentially apply
um something what advice should i give someone in that situation should they should they continue studying perhaps or building expertise so that they're in a better position to to apply in the future when the number of positions grows or um yeah
um yeah i mean again it's hard to answer that in general it depends on what what
background the person has and what what sorts of jobs they're interested in but i think ah if one casts a fairly large net in terms of what a i issues one wants to work on there there's a fairly ah fairly large range of organizations
it's not just ah it's not just f h i there's also ah the center for the study of existential risk ah the <unk> center for the future of intelligence the tech policy lab at the university of washington
ah and you know various faculty programs around the ah ah various academic programs around the country in the u s and around the world are are looking to hire people
for example as <unk> or a faculty member in in areas related to a i and policy if if you're someone with an academic background
and there are probably a fair number of ah policy positions at ah tech companies that aren't necessarily specific to a i but that would lead to getting valuable experience ah in the broad area of tech policy
so um again to generalize a bit i would recommend casting a fairly large net and working in adjacent areas if you can't immediately work in the exact right place
ah because this is not some not the sort of area where people have been working on a i policy for decades and it's hard to break in for that reason it's more just ah that it's still a field that's growing
and i don't think that that growth will stop i think there will be more opportunities in the future but if if you can't find the right opportunity now
then ah then you know talk to people ah in the field about what sorts of opportunities are on the horizon and try and work in adjacent fields that might be one thing to consider
yeah so what do you think would be the biggest challenges for someone starting out trying to start a career in this area
ah depending on one's background i think the main challenge would be ah ah <unk> up on areas of weakness
so for example if you have a policy background you might want to focus on ah learning more about a i ah and if you have a technical background you might want to focus more on learning about policy
um i i think one of the challenges ah <unk> is what you mentioned before about there not being a super ah clearly accessible literature on the topic
and i i think there's some effort being ah going into addressing that with the career guide and the <unk> that i mentioned
um but i'm not really sure that there's ah you know any specific set of pitfalls that i would recommend
people avoid besides you know ah not um you know neglecting the the areas in which ah they're weak don't don't try and rest on your laurels in say technical areas or policy areas because it's a fairly interdisciplinary ah area
and you would need to ah think about um what sorts of disciplinary perspectives would be beneficial to solving the problem you're interested in and not just ah what is your background though of course you want to draw on your strengths
um i guess it's a it's a field that is in it's fairly early stages and is is growing quickly
ah it it'd be a good fit for someone who was really able to set their own direction and meet people and potentially attract funding to do what they want to do someone who's gonna create the opportunities that they want to go into
yeah absolutely and i yeah it's it's an area that's evolving and i think a lot ah a lot of the organizations
that exist today ah and i have mentioned as as you know good places to work and so forth didn't exist five years ago so yeah
yeah some of them didn't exist one year ago so ah it's it's an area in flux and i think you as with politics
you should be <unk> think about thinking you know thinking about um what what's sort of um yeah what what's the right place for you to be in
um but yeah i think it's it's a very exciting area to work in and i think that a lot of people will find that ah you know it's an area that would benefit from their their background
un so if you had someone that could go into any organization or role and that'd be a good fit what what kind of ah person would you think is most valuable out of everything
most valuable person i don't really have an answer for that
you don't have an answer for that
yeah
is there any is there any ah say vacancy out there that you think you know you just wish that someone someone could fill it
um
any one ah one one vacancy that that comes to mind is ah for the policy researcher position at <unk> so they're currently hiring for for someone to specifically look at a i policy
so i think the the the case is pretty clear that that would be a good place to work and a good role to have if you're interested in influencing the conversation around a i policy and being exposed to the latest developments
so ah yeah if you're if you'd be a good candidate for that and you're interested in that you should definitely apply
um so so sometimes ah i i find people who want to work on a i policy because they don't see themselves as quite cut out for for technical core research perhaps because their math skills aren't quite good enough
ah is that a sensible way to go or is in some ways the a i strategy work ah harder just because it's it's less clear it's less precise than than technical work
um i wouldn't say it's harder or easier it's just different ah but even even on the technical side there's there's a lot of ah <unk>
so ah you know a i safety wasn't very crisply defined a few years ago and it's starting to move more in the direction of technical rigor
and i think the same thing will happen to a i policy to some extent but there will also always be some element of ah relationship building and and you know qualitative analysis and so forth
that ah that certainly is is not exactly the same as as solving technical problems so ah yes i do think that having ah a different background would ah it would make sense to choose different areas to work with base based on your background
but i wouldn't say that ah you know working on the safety problem is totally technical and the policy problem is totally <unk> ah but certainly there's some correlation there
and what kind of level of technical um understanding do you have to get to in order to be able to make a useful contribution
um i'm not sure that you need any specific level in order to make some contribution so ah for example there are there are a lot of roles that can be played by people who are just you know good at <unk> the literature on a particular topic
so for example if you're interested in ah understanding the role that a i could ah play in authoritarian states
then you don't necessarily have to have any technical background to read up on the literature around surveillance and coercion and ah and things like that
so i think there's a lot of room for ah just good <unk> and and people who are curious and interested to dip in areas they're unfamiliar with
um but i think there's also a fairly high ceiling for you know what would be useful
i think it would also be good to have people with very strong technical backgrounds thinking about the you know the <unk> the <unk> gritty game theory issues related to arms races and so forth
so i think yeah it's a pretty it's a pretty broad range of possible ah skill sets that would be useful
right so you're thinking if you can just understand what you can speculate about what an a i might be capable of doing in the future and then if you know economics or if you know social science
then you can think what implications would that have for politics and that kind of thing even if you don't understand specifically how the how the a i would work
yeah ideally you know a little bit about each of those things but you don't need to be an expert in everything it's impossible to be an expert in everything
so ah you it's not ah feasible to to learn about every every single discipline of of which i'll list several in this ah policy ah career guide that that you mentioned
ah clearly you cannot be an expert ah you know a deep expert in in technical a i economics sociology political science etc
ah but knowing a little bit and and being able to collaborate with people with complementary skill sets is also very valuable
so ah i think a lot of the the most exciting work in the next few years will involve collaboration between people on the technical side and on the policy side
right so so how can someone tell which which kind of paths they're most suited for
um i don't think that there's any clear algorithm for this but talking to people in the area and and in reading ah some of the literature and thinking about where ah where you think the gaps are
what ah what areas you think that you can shed light on given your background is definitely something ah you should do ah
you should look at what sorts of job opportunities are available and you know cast a fairly broad net you know because you don't necessarily know what what's going to strike your interest until you stumble upon that opportunity
and networking is also super helpful so i think not just in terms of finding out about job opportunities and figuring out where there's a nice fit but also finding out about ah different organizational cultures and ah where you might fit in is ah also useful
so um yeah i don't think there's ah a single algorithm but networking and reading more of the literature and looking at job job <unk> are all good things to do
yeah what kinds of ah places can people network are there any events that are open to people who don't yet have roles
yeah so ah all of the a i conferences are open to anyone who is capable of ah you know make you know paying for the trip and the the ticket
so ah so some examples of of big a i a i conferences are <unk> i c m l ah
um triple a i and so forth
um ah yeah <unk> you know the biggest ah um you know machine learning conference right now with an emphasis on deep learning i c m l is also a very large one actually i'm not sure which one of those is bigger
ah i haven't been to i c m l but i've been to <unk> a few times ah i clear i c l r is ah also a deep learning specific ah conference
so i think going to conferences like that and specifically going to workshops and <unk> that are relevant to policy questions which often happens at these conferences
ah so for example at <unk> last year there was um there was a symposium on the a i and the law so ah there
there are opportunities like that to network and find ah find out more about how people in that area are thinking and to meet people um who have similar interests
um and you know that's just on the a i side it's also ah it's also we're thinking about more ah policy oriented conferences so there's some conferences like the governance of emerging technologies conference
ah the we robot conference series and probably a few others that would be of interest ah to people who are you know either on the technical side and want to move in a more thinking about policy side
or just they're in the policy side but they wanna you know specifically seek out people interested in a i ah those those would be good places to look
um and are any of the organizations involved open enough that ah someone who's interested in the area ah can can drop by and and get to know people
yeah so um i think ah particularly on the academic side though to some extent also at corporations ah there's a fair amount of openness
and ah you know for example at f h i we host a lot of visitors ah who just want to learn more about our work and the same is true of other organizations
yeah um so it sounded like in your guide you thought the best undergraduate major was was something like combining a technical subject
like math or computer science with a more social science topic like politics or economics
um assuming that post people listening to this have already chosen their major what should people do at the <unk> level should should they do a p h d or just go and work directly at at google if they can
i
i mean i've i've probably said this a million times but i don't think there's a clear answer for everyone ah but ah
but certainly you know it doesn't hurt to have an advanced degree of course there are opportunity costs but there there's certainly more job opportunities available for someone who ah you know has has a p h d
so for example um i don't know if it's a hard requirement ah but certainly it would be a benefit for people applying to a fair number of industry jobs ah if they had an advanced degree
um as well as in academia so it it's hard to avoid the fact that ah you know for academic jobs as much as ah um yeah we would like to you know hire people solely based on their demonstrated skills
often also the case that there are university policies surrounding you know what sorts of degrees you need for for different roles and ah pay grades and so
ah there's definitely value to having a graduate degree ah despite the you know <unk> opportunity cost if fi you have an opportunity
but ah you know as with all these things it it depends on someone's background and if you have a clear opportunity to make an impact
ah and you could you know perhaps get some of the best of both worlds by you know also taking classes online or <unk> at a local university and being a part time p h d student or master's student i think
yeah you should yeah ah there might be ways to have your cake and eat it too but ah it would depend on the particular person
yeah and and i guess the most obvious options at the <unk> level are things like machine learning or computer science or or economics so i guess public policy is that useful
yeah so ah um yeah just to give a particular example um at oxford we have a handful of people who are interested in a i safety and a i policy as well as broader issues related to the future
um and you know just at the organization that i'm at f h i there are people who are either currently enrolled or who soon will be enrolled in programs ah in mine which is human and social dimensions of science and technology
as well as machine learning ah cyber security and <unk> so there there's a wide range of possible areas that one could study and you know find an advisor that is suitable and interested in supporting yeah interesting work
yeah so so some people worry that doing work in this this in this area could could be harmful if not done well ah so for example it could be that as you were saying earlier that regulation in this area ah could could be done poorly and would actually be harmful overall
or that bringing greater attention to the issue could could reinforce the arms race dynamic or tentatively having people ah get involved who don't have enough technical expertise could could bring the area into <unk>
ah how seriously do you take those kinds of concerns should should people be cautious about about ah jumping into the area if if they don't feel like they're really on top of things
um i
think that is a reasonable concern ah and yeah there there is
in fact some some risk of ah you know <unk> yourself or your cause by ah by being um you know too too <unk> or whatever the particular charge might be
but on the other hand there's a lot of noise in the system no matter what and whatever you whatever you do in the near term there will be terminator pictures and and people who you know dismiss a i safety and ah all sorts of other things you can't really control
so i i think they're also risks of not acting which is you know not ah you know not being able to ah help out when there's an important program and you have something to contribute
so i would say you know if if that's something that concerns you then talk to people about you know your beliefs and what your beliefs are you know
whether there's you know and look at surveys of experts and you know see see how ah you know what what what the you know reasonable distribution is among people who have studied the topic more
so ah i don't think it's you know an all or nothing sort of thing where you either have to stay ignorant or be a super expert
i think there's there's a middle ground where you sort of you know develop your confidence little by little as you go and trying ah remain as modest as possible in areas that you have little expertise
yeah i suppose you could always track the things that you know people like you or nick <unk> are saying and how you speak about the issues so that you so you don't come across as <unk> and you know you you have a measured and precise tone
right right
yeah so so you mentioned earlier that a i ah could potentially be used in military applications and that's one way that things could go badly um given that do you see much value in people going into military or intelligence roles to with with the hope of limiting this ah in the in the future
possibly ah it's really hard to say it would depend on the particular role so ah probably a role you know higher up in the chain and more on the policy and strategy sides of things
as opposed to the more operational or logistical or just execution side of things ah would be more likely to give you an opportunity to to affect those sorts of things
but ah there might also be benefits to that ah beyond just ah you know having a direct impact on the issue while in that role
you could also then develop valuable connections and ah know the right people to influence from the outside ah down the road or ah have a better understanding of the dynamics of the problem ah and you know what needs to be done to solve it so
ah i i definitely wouldn't ah dismiss it but i also you know wouldn't necessarily recommend it across the board as as the best thing to do
yeah i i guess the intelligence services and military are just such enormous bureaucracies i suppose i'd i'd worry that someone you like ah it's just unlikely perhaps that you would be in the right place at the right time or or have enough discretion in those roles to be able to make a difference
but as you say it could could help you to build up your career capital so you can get ah other other good useful roles in the future and and you know how the system works so you could potentially influence it ah from outside and talk to the right people
yeah exactly so ah you know again it would depend on the particular person and what other options they have but it's certainly worth considering
um what about what about foreign policy could it be useful to go into department of state or something like that and work on arms control agreements
so you know even just current arms control agreements so you you understand how they work and can think about how they might work for a i in future
yeah so i think that could be very useful ah looking at arms control and foreign policy you know both from an academic perspective and from a practitioner perspective i think it's very valuable
and it's something that ah were not that's not our strong suit in the a i safety and policy community right now
ah so more more could be done on that front ah but i i think some of the same caveats apply to the the as to the military and intelligence side of things that the state department for example is a very large bureaucracy
yeah ah and how do you feel about um just more general attempts to ah to make the world ah ah better such that when a i is developed things are more likely to go well
for example just improving the you know quality of government ah in general trying to get get the right kinds of people elected or improving our ability to forecast the future across the board
is is i guess one worry would be that that's just not sufficiently leveraged on on this specific problem and if you think a i is really likely to be the key issue then you want to work on that specifically
um but maybe if you could improve our ability to forecast technological changes in the future across the board then that could be a better option and also um you just have a lot more options if you're if you're open to broader ways of improving the world
yeah i i don't think there's a clear decision for everyone but it it both at the you know group level and at the individual level it often makes sense to take a sum it up a portfolio approach
so ah there are people at f h i who also are affiliated with the center for effective altruism and involved in building the e a community ah like owen <unk> and toby <unk>
so there are people who <unk> ah that boundary and and you know look for opportunities to benefit both sides and there are also people ah you know who focus on one thing or the others
so i don't think there's a clear right answer but ah certainly the the sorts of trade <unk> you mention sound reasonable on the one hand one would want ah the world to be in a better place
for there to be more people who are thinking carefully about ah making ah making good decisions and benefiting ah future people um in in various important decision-making roles
ah but there it it's quite uncertain you know what what impact you could have on a i and likewise even even if you work directly on a i it's not totally clear that ah that's always the best thing you should do
but you know i have a <unk> you know bias towards thinking that work that direct work is is ah you know needs more attention at the moment um but ah i think you know that you should take that with a grain of salt
because you know i would like more people to help solve the specific problems i'm working on
so so we should potentially continue trying to get people involved we'll just become a i researchers right away
right
so so that's ah that's all of my questions was there anything you wanted to add
any inspiring message
um yeah i mean i'll just circle back on what i was saying earlier which is that ah a i safety was in a very ah um nebulous stage of development a few years ago
and it took the work of ah nick <unk> in <unk> and stuart russell in giving a lot of talks and writing <unk> to call more attention to it and give it more legitimacy
ah and then subsequent work was done to refine the issue and develop research agendas ah ah by by people including the authors of he concrete problems in a i safety paper
ah and now we have a lot of <unk> and graduate students working specifically on this we have people in industry specifically working on well defined problems in this space
and we have the opportunity to make a similar transition in a i policy over the next few years
to removing from ah fairly high level <unk> and and problem <unk> to specific proposals and ah you know ah formal models and ah you know ah good white papers
and so forth ah over the next few years and it's it's an area that would benefit from a lot of people's expertise so i would definitely encourage people to ah who you know think they might have some relevant expertise to seriously consider
um yeah i'll just reiterate that since i wrote our problem profile on positively shaping artificial development we've heard from a lot of people who think that this is the most neglected area ah within within the a i safety
ah and i'm i'm very keen to get ah more people ah working on these on these problems and getting more organizations ah hiring for them ah so if if it's something that you're interested in
i think you should you should definitely be be looking into it more and and we'll put up ah links to to guides where you can ah find out more and and meet the right people
yeah thanks so much and have a great day and look forward to talking in future
all right thanks bye
in this week's episode we drive the new ford <unk> we answer questions about e <unk> and driving in cold weather
and also answer the question what we do with the cars once we done testing them next on talking cars
hi and welcome back i'm mike <unk>
so we like to give a little behind the scenes look at what goes on here at consumer parts auto test track
we talk to people who are die hard enthusiast as well as people that look upon cars as merely appliances
and we find that they are absolutely shocked when they find out that we buy every test car
that we put through our test program and that for testing purposes we drive in different car every night
so to take us through the process ryan how you decide what do you drive every night
well before that we you know the routine we buy we buy all these cars anonymously
we bring them back here we check them in um we have a wall of keys and it's like a fantasy land right
um and we get to pick these cars every night um almost every single night we drive a different car that's pretty ridiculous right
um so there's this the wall keys we pick what we gonna drive
and some of these cars um you know if it's a brand new car it's has a priority we have to give it up to mile to get to fifty thousand miles before we can test it
and there's people that are riding first drives or the engineers that people that have a direct influence on ah you know the early testing
have to get these cars you know first
if video producers that get on us for doing a first drive video
always bothering us to do more
so you you know the there's there there's some ah some sort of ah i i wanna call a packing order but
you know there's there's price people need to get these cars right and we all you understand that
and um you know make way for that um so once we're once we're done testing them um
they go to another wall and that wall that's the huge wall yeah this wall has is all like the <unk> right
but this is this is where it gets interesting because this is where it gets interesting the other
because the first keyboard is cars they have to all get miles we are driving them <unk> right when it moves to the other board now it's ah it's selective
and that's when you get to see the favorites
right yeah you could see the cars that people really actually like and the cars that you know after testing feel like ah
no i'm i'm not gonna drive that anymore
yeah it's um it's so it's kind of interesting because so you know some of these cars is it liked the winter auto start
heated seats and and ah when it's clear winters um s u <unk> i mean i i go up to vermont and do stuff i always have an s u v
something with auto drive
yeah i will drive you you you know you went to both you got trailers to to tell us something that's all
and that that brings us you know around to the to the spring time which we're hoping for that comes anytime soon
but but ah the most frequently asked question that i know i get asked probably you guys too
is what you do with the cars once you done testing them
so you know we we sell the cars when we're done so the first thing we do is a a company wide email goes out
ah to ah let all the employs know you know what cars we're currently selling what the what the selling price how many miles are on them
and ah the cars that aren't sold to employs then they typically go the auction
ah we sell them there and then we take that money to buy more test cars and usually these cars have anywhere from six to twelve thousand miles on them when we're done testing
ah some have more we keep some longer than others like let's say it has maybe some advance safety features that we wanna do more testing with
or maybe there's a direct competitor of this car coming soon we wanna keep this current car in our test fleet
so that we have some really good back to back comparisons
and so considering what we have on hand right now um so ah mike what what kind of a a go to car that you find yourself signing out reason
so i actually have a few go to cars i mean one of them is the <unk> <unk> <unk> ah now
the only one we have the manual
the only car we currently have with the manual transmission you know it's it's ah it has really great hand lane really nice six speed manual <unk>
um i actually don't go to a quiet as much right now because ah it's you know quiet cold to have summer tires summer tires don't work as well in the winter
but you know when it's a <unk> day i'll take it and it just kinda goes to show how important a manual transmission is
cuz i actually don't even really love that car you know it's it's rides pretty stiff
ah and it's sound like as tons of power and it's front wheel drive i am not a fan of front wheel drive performance cars you know
but it shows how much i love driving manual transmission i would drive that car any chance i get
but other cars that i go to ah genesis <unk> it's like ah nicer <unk> <unk> you know i love that
car b m w x five i mean it's it's a fantastic s u v it's just great in every way smooth comfortable nice <unk>
five doesn't get cold
it's that's will be it yeah the keys are never available and then they ran fifteen hundred because that is it's my favorite pickup truck i love pickup trucks
ah it's so ah capable yet drives almost like a almost like a car and it has great sound of v eight
so those were those my go to
so ryan when you can choose what would you what do you find in
um it's it's i guess is that earlier to winter i've been in north a bunch um i use the x five a lot
i like the <unk> um you know like the way you've mentioned the <unk> like
i don't fit in that well it is fun to drive but there's just time that i am like it's just frustrating that i don't fit in that well um
i find myself um i as a as i've mentioned before i i got through s u v fatigue
i just sometimes get tired of i miss cars and ah i i find myself signing out the nissan <unk>
over and over it's got heated seats it's got a decent ride and it's android auto so i've got i've got i've got a map
i've got my music it's just an easy car to live with i mean it definitely has it's faults as we found in our testing
but um i i just i just can i'm comfortable in my car i don't know i don't know what how else to put it
and no one's fighting you for the keys
and no one's fighting me for the keys
but so but but like you guys i mean i'm i'm <unk> toward pick up trucks all the time you know these are test vehicles
we we take them to home depot we go to the garden centers we we use them to to work all the time
and and i also i'm i'm with you on the ram and the <unk> both great trucks
ah which kind of brings us to our next topic of what we're driving this week at the track
and um so since clearly pickup trucks are big these days we have our new ah <unk> ford <unk>
this was ah hotly anticipated by those of us that that love pick up so um mike if you could give us a you know quick <unk> of of the <unk> and how it got here
yeah so ah the <unk> were was first sold in the u s and in nineteen <unk> and was sold here until the two thousand eleven model year
um and sales were strong you know for for a while when when that pickup was first first came out ah but like in the mid two thousand sales started going down
ah pretty dramatically and so you know that was a joint project the <unk> between <unk> they had the b serious pickup
that was basically you know almost identical to the <unk>
so ford <unk> look at it and it was like you know well you know is it worth with sales going down so much is it worth you know investing the money and
to wanna you know what um totally redesign the truck as ah by two thousand and eleven that thing was really old it was an aging truck
and so they decided the you know to um did not you know have the truck here anymore
and then you know ah the marker was basically this compact or mid size pickup segment you know largely dominated by a toyota <unk> has been for a long time
but the nissan frontier kept in there but those you know the <unk> especially quiet an old design as well
than ah <unk> with their colorado and g m c with the twin the canyon
you know redesign their <unk> and i think ford looked at it like okay hold it we still we have a <unk> that's sold in other markets
this and you know the <unk> was redesign came back was redesign <unk> <unk> is coming out
i think they said we gotta get back in this market because <unk> are still hot in this country
um and so they they have this existing design sold up elsewhere
they've brought it back here and that's what we are now it's <unk> ford <unk>
and not everyone needs you know ah ah ah fifteen hundred half ton pickup truck i mean
i mean i need a i mean i need a thirty-five hundred <unk> that's that's just me that's just me
another short joke they've running birds the this is what this is i have a hard time with this segment because this truck the the <unk> we have was about forty thousand dollars
you can get a full size truck for a little more money and i personally i think it's crazy because i don't fit in these trucks as well
um and there it's it's half it's half the truck i mean it doesn't make sense to me for that kinda money if you're if you're space ah space conscious you want a smaller vehicle it makes some sense but beyond that
and and and i post it on consume reports facebook page ah ah a picture of of the new <unk>
and we spent forty thousand dollar and almost every comment was forty thousand dollars
it's a lot of money for that
so you know we we try to out fit the trucks a certain way you know we all cars we try to out fit the way we think most people are gonna the way the trucks are gonna be sold so that's why right now that truck is forty thousand
a current full size trucks or right now and then up and about fifty thousand so for ten thousand more you're gonna it have a really nice full size truck not a <unk>
that's what i mean either way i drove it i drove it last night and i i i was pleased actually
because i i went into it of like ah the <unk> i don't care for the <unk> ah the <unk> is great but it doesn't i don't fit in that well
it doesn't excite me when i drive it i am just ah um the colorado is the same thing um i fit in that better this thing i actually fit in quiet well the seating position in nice i can see
um my great um the the power train it's got a um full cylinder um eco boost um
yeah and it's has point of power but it's not smooth there's there's some sort of a drive line vibration i feel um i'm not gonna <unk> that too much cause it might be this thing needs to break in a little more four hundred thousand mile
four hundred thousand miles we can drive it that far
broke our record from four miles on it
it's only got four hundred miles on it roughly and um things are gonna break keep you know settling and breaking
we've noticed that things like <unk> ah change over out breaking theory like sometimes quiet of and gets smoother
and and you know the transmission it was a couple um <unk> shifts and you know these things yeah these things get ironed out but i mean
it's got it's got plenty of power i was i was happy with that the the the <unk> feels under power to me even the colorado feels ah under power to me
this thing on the highway i noticed quiet a bit of wind noise from the door seals and ah you know just a yeah the seals i guess um
and other than that it's got
i'm with you ah in a lot ways i was actually really looking forward to this truck so ah in some ways i was a little more let down
because i i've really to think we need a really good i think we the market needs a really good compact gear pickup
it looks apart no question about it and it's a real truck unlike the <unk> <unk> which is really just a glorified you know s u v yeah basically a car
um this is a real truck the biggest great for me is the ride it has one of the <unk> <unk> rides i think of any pickup on the market right now um
you think it's worst than the <unk>
i'm not saying it's worse i'm saying it's
i don't think i think it ride fair than <unk>
ah ah i i think interesting
i'm i'm with ryan on this actually ah i i it's not a smooth ride
so if you if you you know if you're pick a person you're gonna put up with that i had it for a weekend and i drove put a lot of miles on it
and i was fine with it but it's definitely noticeably <unk> and rough a road just <unk> no question about it
so i've that's probably my big describe is that it's you know if you someone who buys a <unk> this is this is completely different completely different
you can't even compare those two
but people do that's the problem and we do i mean we compare
big fan of a <unk> it drives it drives really nicely but the thing
yeah the pilot i mean it of course it rides well but
you know i agree with you on on the drive train though it's to me it sounds <unk>
it's it's sound <unk> yet it's got good powers and then also keep in mind it has a ten speed automatic transmission
it's pretty impressive you know and and and i found in general it shifts pretty smoothly it's no breaking in
but those are couple of times where i would you know be ah <unk> a low speed turn and there was you know ah a little delay on figuring out which gear i wanted to be in um
you know like i i was other then that i think it's a little silly i don't like the five foot bed i
and you can't get if you want the crew ford crew cab like what we have you can only get the five foot bed
so the way the <unk> works is if you get the smaller you know extra cab or whatever ah you you get the six foot bed
ah if you get there four or two cab it's only the five of bed so you don't have a those are your choices there's no bed choice
where as to say <unk> colorado you can get the longer bed with the with the the bigger cab
so and the other things like just like the running boards are just placed awkwardly there's no grabbing aboard to get in you wanna pick up that's sits that high
it should be a grabbing luis it is kinda tall i noticed too
ah just one more thing on handling i thought was interesting is this thing feels like a miniature f one fifty
it got this that dull slow kind of steering it kinda just dead
and then when you yeah and when you turn it actually has body role like it kinda <unk> a little bit
which into that kind of that tricky feel i don't think it's makes the end of the world but it's it was interesting to me that it it reacted kinda like that because colorado is nothing like a <unk>
right right in my eyes but
so ah you know ah keep keep the check and back from consumer report
still fresh we have this is just our early impressions
we are gonna have more information pretty soon we're gonna have a first drive in a video ah which takes us to our next section of questions
ah please send us your video and text questions to talking cars and <unk> dot com
first up is a video question about the toyota <unk> four hybrid and let's take a listen
hello c r team i and my husband are expecting baby in june and we're in the market to buy our first car in next month or so
i have a question about about <unk> <unk> hybrid or wheel ride system
i have learned that the rear is disconnected from the front and the rear wheels get power from the auxiliary battery which get charged when brakes are applied
does this mean that on a snowy highway when we need all wheel all wheel drive constantly
when we are driving this car at a steady pace without using too much brakes then i'm turning into risk of <unk> the battery
and soon the car turning into just front wheel drive what is reliability battery getting discharged completely considering we have a lot of snow in north east canada
and sometimes we may need all the wheel drive for for long period of six to seven hours and if it's a big problem then should we disregard <unk> hybrid
and look for alternate hybrid like rouge hybrid
wow what what a great question and clearly shows that ah talking cars listeners and viewers are very very smart and highly educated
she knows what she's talking about here um yeah so the the new <unk> four hybrid is actually gonna have the same um hybrid system that they been they've been using this hybrid system since the first <unk> hybrid
and i remember this distinctly because i can remember being in a <unk> watching a <unk> hybrid brand new car stuck front wheel drive looked like it was front wheel drive um trying to climb a hill
and this is because the this car has a a gasoline engine and it's front it's technically a front wheel drive car and the hybrid system is a completely separate unit in the rear
um batteries electric motors separately controlled at the rear now um
in in theory they they say this thing you know when you take off it's gonna give you power you know
that the real wheel this senses slip and then gonna help you go over time though you can drain that battery down
and you are left with a potentially a front drive vehicle
right i mean ah ah and just to do a contrast as oppose to a traditional
all wheel drive it will drive it just have a big drive <unk> right where you can lock everything up
exactly um and it's it's a neat it's a neat idea but i mean i have seen this thing struggle
and this this green technology the brand new twenty nineteen <unk> four is gonna have this same um the system in it
so for her she really weighing heavily on having all wheel drive that i wouldn't use this as a um you know substitute for that
um at the same time you you you don't need all wheel drive all the time even in the snow
if if if you know ah sounds like she's mostly concerned about being you know highway drives in snow
well you know hopefully she has ford ford snow tires cause that's actually the most important thing if if she drives them in a lot of snow
she should have ford snow tires and then even if it was only front wheel drive she in most cases still be fine and keep in mind this system was designed to be in front drive
as much as possible for efficiency so therefore ah it's only for the most part it's only gonna switch to ah to all wheel drive
when it like you said it's senses slip so a lot of the time even in snow she's gonna be driving down the highway
it's gonna wanna be in front wheel drive any way until it senses that slip so but but even then really the more important thing
is ah ah is snow tires but unless she's ah you know she's might notice a problem on you know steep up hills
on the highway or even more so on back roads is really where this gonna potentially be a problem
if that battery work if she were to be unlucky the the battery is drained when she's trying to go up a steep slippery up
and having having a new a new kid in i mean ah ah maybe i'll i'll be nervous to tell her that this is good idea
so you could say well you know so she's thinking about another hybrid ah you know the nissan rogue hybrid
but the promise with a lot of these <unk> they're gonna work you know they they yeah they become all wheel drive in same similar way
so maybe a hybrid is all wheel drive is not her best choice
ah an alternative that we talked about is is you know one of consumer reports top rated vehicles the <unk> <unk>
um which you don't have to worry about the all wheel drive system ah kind of you know saying bye bye
when and you you using it a lot so
it's not gonna be as efficient but it's still quiet efficient
the efficiency or do you want the safety of being stuck
now she has no more ah worries about you know about the auto drive system not being there when she needs it
thanks your question very still you clearly know your cars and now we're gonna move onto the next one which is getting a used <unk> and winter driving
the question reads i live in new hampshire and looking to get an e v car i'm looking at a used b m w i three
a used tesla model s or new model three of all wheel drive
how does an e v rear wheel drive handle the snow with snow tires of course thank you c r for teaching me about snow tires
i normally think best to worse all wheel drive front wheel drive
rear and rear wheel drive with internal combustion engine cars where would an e v rear wheel drive fit into that lineup
so ryan tire man tell us pros and cons
this is this is a an interesting question because um
it's not easy answer um the first thing that comes to mind is his he says that he lives in new hampshire
it's cold there you know my first my my first reservation would be having electric car in a cold climate
right cause it would drive you nuts you lose a lot of um range right um the batteries worst kind of musical
we did a story on this recently
first issue um but going back to what he's saying i'm hundred percent you have have snow tires um a rear wheel drive car is going to
the rear wheel drive electric car because you have electric motors they have regenerative <unk>
my concern would be when you lift of the throttle will you have to get used to it when you lift of the throttle it's gonna be it's essentially dragging at the rear end you're creating a room
which is a weird feeling on a dry surface
dry road right and now if it's a slippery surface excuse me they <unk> they gonna they are gonna be dragging and if it's really slippery the stability control the cars can do a lot of work
now you are not gonna get spin out of control we have you know modern stability control is very good specially in these cars but um
is it gonna go in the snow absolutely i think there is gonna be some learning curve there like driving it smoothly and not dealing with all the you know the the the stability control going crazy um
he's right i mean all rear wheel car is probably your best bet with snow tires of course um
when it come to front rear drive it's preference i mean i drove a b m w for years with <unk> bag and snow tires and i went anywhere i needed to go
but i preferred that um for the average driver maybe front wheel drives a little bit better with snow tires um that's preference
i i think front wheel drive is easier to control for most drivers because ah you don't have to worry about power ah power on <unk> like you do with the wheel drive car rear wheel drive car is definitely more fun
but what i don't like about front wheel drive cars is you're asking you know the ah the front wheels to do two thing both power and drive the cars
you know power the car forwards and also steer the car and that's what i like about
you know a rear wheel drive cars but i think the bigger question is why does this person want you know is there a specific reason he's looking for a rear wheel drive
ah and if that's the case if that's the case then then you know if you want the rear drive because you find that more fun to drive then go for
but you know you know ah you could go with a little newer tesla
and you know ah and get all wheel drive so that's another option
but the the most the interesting thing about these electric cars though is i i looked up the weight distribution and it's actually ah not bad
i mean so for instance the i three is <unk> percent of the weight is to the rear this this is you know ah our our testing
ah the model s rear drive was <unk> percent to the rear model three <unk> percent
so we put our skill the point is there's some weight back there you know a lot of cars are in a lot of rear wheel drive cars in <unk>
so you've got a little bit more weight over the rear to give you some traction but the most important thing is with snow tires and a b s
ah traction control and electronic still stability control you're gonna be fine even with rear wheel drive
right i i was gonna make the argue the front wheel drive the weight is over the drive wheel
so in slippery conditions that's that's usually gets complicated
if that's the because because the weight transfer goes rear were
thanks so much for your question kinda brings us to our final one and unfortunately we gotta rap this up ah the question reads
love your show i drive a <unk> accord e x l and love all the drivers system
i drove the car in light snow and after ten minutes i got a message on the screen that the radar is obstructed
meaning no driver assist that you're probably seeing on your screen right now what can one conclude from that about self driving cars in the winter
exactly our concern all of this technology that's why self driving cars aren't here yet
one of the real sensors sensors is a broad term there's there's all different types of sensors there's optical um there's ah you know eyesight ah there's <unk> there's all kind of sensors
if they're clogged up or there's something in the way they're not gonna work well and if you're <unk> on that to save your life you're crazy
this is the this is the week <unk> on this technology it's not perfect and he didn't drive far and it was already not working this is this is a major concern
yeah what we recently ah did a story on consumer reports dot org ah called ah how to keep your cars safety sensors clean
when snowing ice attack um so the reality is that ah you know the you know there's radar sensors on the front of a lot of new cars
it have you know four closure morning automatic automatic emergency breaking ah usually in the grill quiet often in the the emblem you know the <unk> have gotten quiet huge these days
and so they have those radar sensors in there and so what can happen is snow ice salt can you know get all <unk> up on there
and so when that happens the system's gonna shut down because it knows it can't see what it needs to see anymore
and it will give you warning on your your dashboard that this has happened but now you know for closure warning automatic <unk> not gonna work anymore so you can no longer rely on
it's a little bit regional because if we you know we in a snow belt it's gonna be a bigger issue but still sand and dust and mud and southern state is eventually the same is gonna do the same thing you have to keep these things clean
and you also need to you know and keep in mind there's sensors all around your cars these days you know ah ah you know for blind spot warning and things like that
and and your your ah rear view camera you know there's a little lens back there that you ah you know even in a rain
it it or you know if you if you've been driving in rain and you put you know the car in reverse it's very blurry back there because it's it's all has has ah you know water all over
so it's important to keep these ah sensors clean if you're driving on it ah you know snowy trip or whatever and it gives you that warning
you know pull over the next next rest area that you can and ah clean clean off the front grill
and we actually um did a ah i believe we did a video on this with john <unk> that's online right producer dave can people can check that video out
so ah check out that video because jen tells you she shows you where all the sensors are on the cars and how to clean them
but the more important thing is where they are and also your owners manual will tell you where all the sensors are on your specific car and that's very important to know that
when you get this warning that hey these things aren't working right in the moment we need to know where they are so you can you can clean them
well this can do it for this episode you wanna learn more about the topics and the cars that we talked about check out the show notes and keep those questions coming in talking cars at <unk> dot com
thanks so much for tuning in we'll see you next week
this video was made possible by curiosity stream when you sign up at the link in the description you also get access to nebula the streaming video platform that <unk> is a part of
the wuhan coronavirus began like all new viruses with a remarkably ordinary moment
in late november two thousand nineteen someone it is not yet known who ate a wild animal that by chance carried the novel coronavirus
and days later started to feel the symptoms of what initially seemed like a bad cold
from there more individuals were infected at first through the consumption of other wild animals but later through direct human to human transmission
for the entire month of december the virus was there in wuhan spreading but nobody knew it
the cases presenting as pneumonia were at first considered to be caused by anyone of the countless other viruses that can create such symptoms
eventually the escalation in cases and effect that almost all the first patients had bought food at one particular wild animal market caught the wuhan city government's attention
the first official confirmation that something was up came on new year's eve
december thirty first when the municipal health commission published a press release acknowledging the situation
over a month after the first transmission at the time this was small local news
only a few dozen cases of pneumonia in a city of millions in a country of a billion
but then came the news that this was not one of the many pre-existing pneumonia causing viruses
this was something new western media first reported on the novel coronavirus around january eighth
the new york times <unk> wrote there is no evidence that the new virus is readily spread by humans and it has not been tied to any deaths
that would soon change
on january twenty first when the world health organization started tracking the outbreak there were two hundred and eighty two cases
the next day three hundred and fourteen the next five hundred and eighty one
then eight hundred and forty six then one thousand three hundred and twenty
then two thousand and fourteen and by the start of the week of january twenty sixth it was clear that this would not be a quick and painless virus
this would be one for the history books and it was going to get a lot worse before it got any better
drastic circumstances called for drastic action it was clear given the trends that <unk> hospitals would soon be overwhelmed by patients
and in the case of highly infectious viruses like coronavirus that makes a bad situation worse as infected individuals will try to recover at home
where the virus can more easily spread therefore the decision was made on january <unk> to build a brand new facility capable of treating one thousand patients at once
<unk> hospital it was announced that this would be done fully constructed by february second
just ten days later
china has experienced with such a feat in two thousand three the country suffered an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars which is also caused by a form of coronavirus
much like with the novel coronavirus hospitals were overwhelmed and many had to turn away patients
in response the government decided to build a new hospital
over six days seven thousand construction workers brought the <unk> hospital into reality and it quickly began accepting patients and relieving the <unk> medical system
once the outbreak settled down the <unk> hospital was hailed as a massive success by both the country itself and the world health organization
the statistics speak for themselves overall sars had a fatality rate of nine point six percent
at the <unk> hospital just one point two percent of patients died
and not a single staff member was infected
it's no wonder why china wanted to replicate this
and therefore <unk> was the model for the new coronavirus hospital but this time would be different
the two thousand three hospital began construction over six months after the beginning of the outbreak
the two thousand and twenty hospital started construction less than two months after the first case and just days after the seriousness of the outbreak became clear
there was far less time for planning and design the orders came and then it was immediately time to start
step one was finding a place to put the hospital
the location selected was previously just an open field about fourteen miles or twenty-two kilometers from central wuhan
this kept it away from the dense urban core where further transmission might be easier but the field in question was also right off a large pre-existing road which made access easy
that road was quickly shut down and turned into essentially a parking lot and staging area for the project
the contract for this project was given to china construction third engineering bureau company a subsidiary of the state-owned china state construction engineering corporation
by revenue this is the world's largest construction company and it has experience in enormous projects like <unk> new airport <unk> new capital city and tesla shanghai <unk> factory
if anyone was going to pull this off it was them
to begin construction in earnest they first needed to prepare the selected site
that involved first cutting down all the trees and shrubbery and then perfectly <unk> the ground
out of the ten day construction timeline this took longer than one might think
about forty-eight hours
this was due in part to the fact that the project was significantly <unk> in its first few days
as they scrambled to find workers especially as it's start coincided with the chinese new years
once the land was level though they moved on to constructing the building foundations by sunday january <unk>
for this they used a layered system
on the bottom at eight inch or twenty centimeter layer of sand was placed then what's referred to as a <unk> layer
a formal fabric then a layer of <unk> plastic then another of <unk> layer then another layer of sand
on that they then poured concrete which dried over a few days
but then came the truly impressive element
constructing the buildings themselves in a matter of days
what made this possible was the use of <unk> elements
modular construction such as this has been on the rise recently
it's now a well establish technique for the construction of buildings large and small
the idea is simply that somewhere <unk> in number of identical building elements are built
then they're shipped to the construction site and put together
this has plenty of advantages
first and foremost the use of identical elements built in a factory system to construct a larger building lowers cost through economies of scale
then when you actually get to putting the building together on site construction time is significantly less
which once again lowers cost
in this case though cost was not the primary concern
speed was and modular construction is the fastest way to build
most of these site used a type of <unk> modular construction common with temporary buildings
while it's not clear which company produce the <unk> components it is clear that they existed before the project started
the first building elements started coming together on monday january <unk> just four days after the project broke grounds
they began by building the skeleton on the modular units
each of these units was about the shape and size of a twenty foot shipping container
and this skeleton form included just the floor ceiling and structural supports at each corner
throughout this all separate teams out of the thousands of workers there started to hook the site up to utilities like sewage water electricity and internet
much of this just involved bringing in the state-owned companies responsible for these but for internet and the subsequent building out of an it system private companies like huawei and <unk> got involved
this was no doubt partially because the construction of this hospital drew considerable public attention in china
it came to represent the physical manifestation of the country's response to the crisis and also of china's engineering might
the construction process itself was streamed by state-owned broadcasting companies and up to eighteen million concurrent viewers watched the process
nearly every major <unk> in china reporting from the site publishing footage like what you're seeing now although very few western broadcasters were there
this is part of the reason limited detailed information and footage of the construction exists outside of china state-owned broadcasts
where the government can manage the story and what gets out
it was no doubt viewed as an opportunity by the chinese government in a time when they faced intense criticism for its initial response to the outbreak
but of course to gain that praise the project needed to be successful
on tuesday january <unk> significant portions of the first building were completed while the rest of the complexes foundations were finishing up
over the <unk> and thirtieth more of the overall structure came to be as the walls were installed on and in the skeletons of buildings and work then began on turning these empty buildings into a hospital
each patient room was <unk> with two beds some medical equipment and a bathroom
considering the hospital is built with quarantine in mind there are some unique aspects to the design of these rooms
for one the ventilation system is built to keep a negative pressure in all quarantine areas so that air will go out through an exhaust system rather than out under the door into the rest of the hospital
while at the time of writing it's not entirely known to what extent this coronavirus can spread through airborne transmission a ventilation system like this is standard practice for any quarantine ward
in addition to individual patient rooms separate areas were designed for patient processing diagnostic tools like c t <unk> were installed and other crucial aspects like offices <unk> and <unk> were built in
over the <unk> of january and first and second of february the final areas of the complex were built up the interior installation was wrapped up and all the systems were tested to ensure that the hospital was ready to bring in patients
meanwhile eight people's liberation army transport planes landed at wuhan airport carrying the military medical staff who would staff the hospital
they moved into the facility throughout the same day february second then throughout the night workers put the finishing touches onto the hundreds of rooms
then the next morning the moment that ten days prior seemed impossible arrived
the first patients transferred from other facilities were wheeled into <unk> hospital and thus marked the beginning of its operations
they started with just a few dozen patients but in a matter of days this <unk> to hundreds
<unk> hospital was only the start of china's plan to ramp up the number of available beds in wuhan
just three days after <unk> opening another even larger hospital called <unk> opened
it's sixteen hundred beds and thirty-two wards were built in just twelve days
meanwhile other hospitals were converted to isolate and treat coronavirus patients and <unk> and exhibition centers were turned into hospitals as well
still though even with this swift decisive action reports indicate that many of those with <unk> cases of coronavirus are getting turned away from hospitals in wuhan
it unfortunately seems that coronavirus with its tremendous severity is one of the few things that can <unk> china

hey everyone thanks for tuning in to another wordpress wednesday today wraps up our series that we've done on social media and plugins
ah how to use a hashtag all things kinda social media having to do with wordpress specifically we've looked a lot of different options for facebook instagram twitter youtube pinterest ah all sorts of different network
so if you've missed all those be sure to check those out i will put some links in the description box below so you can check those out and get some ideas
for how to be using those social networks to improve your branding reach and even to just improve the experience that your users have on these networks
alright so today i wanna talk about how to get your your post in wordpress automatically published at least at facebook
i have got a couple of other options that you will be able to get your post published across the board to a ton of different networks all at once
but i first wanna start off by showing you a free option because if you watch my channel you know that free is always in the budget right
so we wanna look at and ah i am just gonna show you on here one second this again is how to get your
blog post as soon as you click publish on a blog post we want it to automatically connect over to your facebook page
and kind of ah do an extra little <unk> over there and maybe also include your featured image over there and then of course put a link to get people to come back to your website
now if you are only interested in using this for one network you know facebook is probably the obvious choice there it's not too much of a time saver
but if you're really trying to connect across multiple networks this could really be a time saver for you
of course if you are running on the dot com version of wordpress ah you probably know about <unk> inside of <unk> you have an option for something like this called <unk>
so take a look at that one ah that's available inside of <unk> if you haven't wanted to use this because of just the heaviness the weight of what <unk> is on your website
ah there's another option so let's do this we are of course in our dashboard we are ah in the add new area and i wanna do a search for
access press facebook is what we are gonna do search for so you can see that right here access press facebook
and this is the option that comes up that we are looking for this is access press is the developers name of this particular plug in
i am not making money off of advertising this i am just showing you solution that i've found in the free range ah now it only has nine nine thousand <unk> it's relatively new
ah it has been updated ah a day ago so that's great we know that ah that this author cares to keep this plug-in secure for us and then of course it says here it's compatible with our version of wordpress
so you always wanna check that if this is later on down the road that you are viewing this video please be sure before you click install on this that it is up-to-date
that it's at least been updated with in the last six months that it's still compatible with your version and that it still has great reviews and ah a lot of active <unk> so you just go and click on install
and because i'm on w p engine with my hosting they of course give you a quick learn to say hey are you sure that ah you wanna do this before you do an ah backup
and i normally just go for it living on the edge people living on the edge
once you activate it you install it and you activate it down here on the left side of your dashboard now you have an access point to get in here and run through the settings
now all that was pretty simple straight forward this this installing any plug-in
here's where it gets a little bit more nerd code style okay wrap your brain around this don't get intimidated by this because all it is is simple instruction
we follow the instruction click through and we are able to basically build what we call an a p i or ah a bridge between your social media network facebook and your website
so we've gotta connect the two and give them in a sense permission to connect and that's what are about to do here
so ah step by step instructions of course it since it isn't right now since we haven't done it yet you need to go ahead and authorize your account to to connect with each other
and you are gonna be looking to copy and <unk> some things here now this gives us clear instruction
please visit here and create a new facebook application to get application i d and application secret so we are gonna click here and i've already got a few created
all you do is click the screen button that says add new and of course i am already logged in to my facebook account and we wanna connect it with a website
so you click website and then here you go quick start for website you just go ahead and type in what it is
um and and as you walk through this at the end of this process it is going to give you ah the simple code that you copy and paste in to these areas one and two
and they will tell you that it's an application i d and it's an application secret you'll be able to copy and paste it in
then it says click here to get your facebook i d you'll click there and it'll tell what to paste in there
and that's kinda how you do it you just gonna walk down through all these options down here to move the bottom do you wanna ah allow us to auto publish your posts
and your pages may be all the other things you have going on or simply just your post for your blog it's really up to you you can make that choice right here
and then once you got all those settings in place you'll click save settings and you'll be able to start broadcasting these as soon as you'll click publish
so if that's kinda too fast the other cool thing that's ah in this plugin
is check this out you've got an option right here how to use and they've got a quick tutorial video that's probably little more advanced than mine
and they're gonna really help you understand how to set all this up just take a moment and read through this i know we don't always like to read we like to watch videos
but take a moment and read through these instructions this developer really wants to hold your hand and get you successfully publishing
here is the other this really cool author will do is if you are looking to publish across a bunch of networks all at once they do have a <unk> of this
and i'll put the link to this in the description box below this particular <unk> allows you to publish to facebook twitter linkedin and tumblr all at one time
and it's a twenty dollar one time fee for you do purchase this <unk> and install it ah and and run it and
and it again ah it has it has pretty good reviews it's it's still kinda new um so and it's just again been updated ah this year so that's great
if you're looking to go just big and you say you know what <unk> i am using ten different networks and i really need a time saver and and i don't always like having to go over to something like <unk>
and still set everything up i really do want that one magic button that as soon as i click it it blast out across the board i'll give you one more
this is a premium ah ah plug-in and i'll give you one more option here it's called next scripts
now for free they allow you to use one network so if if you are looking to do just instagram or if you are just looking to do just twitter or just facebook this allows you one free
but the second you want to do more than that it's going to immediately ask that you buy the pro version and um i think right now it's on sell for like fifty u s dollars per year
ah so it's a little bit more <unk> fifty bucks but check this out let's see if i can show you oh my word if i can show you like what all oh over here watch this
look at this you guys facebook twitter google plus blogger tumblr flicker i mean there's instagram in here there's pinterest in here there's linkedin in here
there's all sorts of ones that you can ah just check out an see what all is available look at all of these just down the row here
all these different networks that it immediately allows you to sync your website to and with that magic click of publish it will broadcast out
of course each one of these as you install it you'll have to make that connection per network at least one time you'll have to set that up and give permissions for your website to speak to that network
and then you're often running i hope this has helped you if you've used any of these tools or you have another one in mind that you've used
would you put it in the description box or in the comment below so that we can all kinda share our knowledge and grow out wordpress community
i hope you are having a great one i'll see next week for another wordpress wednesday bye y'all
so you're looking to generate real estate leads for your business well i wanna show you guys one of the top performing facebook ads that we've used with thousands of real estate agents
to help them generate a consistent flow of real estate leads for their business and if you guys want this facebook ad copy this template
just go ahead drop a comment just say real estate leads down in the comment section and i'll be able to share this template with you a hundred percent free so you can just copy and paste this into your business
so just go ahead drop a comment real estate leads down in the comment section and give this video a thumbs up now let me just walk you through this template
and then i wanna show you guys how to get this all setup in just a couple of <unk> as well for your business so you know how to actually implement this
so this is a facebook ad to market a new listing and the same thing works on instagram
because facebook owns instagram so when you setup a facebook ad you're also actually setting up an instagram ad so that's pretty cool because you can spend ten dollars per day
and you don't have to spend ten dollars per day on facebook and ten dollars per day on instagram you spend ten dollars per day and it's <unk> evenly between both platforms so you're getting the most exposure
for your real estate business all right so right here we've got this ah your facebook page so this is the demo page i'm using obviously but you're gonna be using it from your page
so let's say jason <unk> and you wanna have a profile picture of yourself because a big part of social media is personal branding
so you wanna branding yourself you wanna brand your business but you wanna have it from your personal facebook business page so now moving down into the actual facebook ad copy
i like to have some emojis because it kind of pops out at people they stop and they check out what's going on and then also when you do the hashtag it makes it all blue and so once again that kind of pops out of people
and then we got see it before anyone else five bedrooms and normally i would put like how many bats as well right here ah but go here to get the prize location plus more pictures
so when you're generating leads what you wanna do is you wanna hold back some information or make something enticing enough for somebody to give you their contact information so their names phone number email address
so you can actually follow up with them and connect with them to help them out with whatever they're looking to do so buy or sell a home right
and so what we're gonna do is we're gonna kinda give a quick little run down about this home but we're gonna hold back enough that we're not gonna give them all the <unk> so their their interest is peaked
and then we can actually go through and generate a lead so we've got this first call to action here and this is sending them to a landing page
okay so i'll show you what that looks right here okay and we're not sending them to our website or our blog okay when you send them to a website or blog they are not optimized for conversions
landing pages are and so that's why we wanna send them specifically to a landing page okay and then the next couple of paragraphs what we're gonna have right here
is a couple of paragraphs talking about the features of the home okay things that people are gonna or like find interesting are they vaulted ceilings is there a pool in the backyard
it's a <unk> garage how big is the lot is it close to parks or is it close to schools or what tell tell me things that i'm actually gonna be interested in about this home
and then last but not least i'd like to wrap it up with a call to action um to the landing page as well okay so right here we've got an image of the exterior of the home
i like to have a one forward facing image and then if you want this is optional you don't have to but you can add more images of the interior but don't give them all the images
because you wanna hold some of the images back so it gives them a reason to actually go through an <unk> so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna set this up
so that we're showing this to people in your specific community and then when they're scrolling through their facebook ins or instagram news feed on their mobile phone or on their desktop whatever it is
they're gonna come over here like oh man this looks interesting i wanna check this home out they'll click on this and then they'll go through they'll put in their contact information
so their name their email address and their phone number and they'll opt in and become a lead
okay so that's the whole process i wanna show you now how to go through and actually set this up because it's nice to be able to go through and know okay i i've got the facebook ad copy template
i know i need to have a landing page but how do i actually set that up and how do i actually follow up with this lead and how do i get all this stuff implemented right
so what i'm gonna show you guys this is a lead generation system and follow-up system that we build out specifically for real estate agents
to simplify the facebook ad and instagram ad creation process for you and not only the ad creation process but the follow-up process as well
so leveraging this in just three clicks we can help you follow up via email text message facebook message and help you generate leads
and have these leads automatically book appointments with you so i'm gonna show you guys how this is done so let's say you wanna go through and market a listing
so we're gonna go through and click on the marketing listing okay because that is this ad campaign template right here that's generating our clients on average <unk> leads per month
so we generate over <unk> real estate leads with this system showing you exactly the step-by-step process that all of our real estate clients do
okay so we're gonna ready give this a campaign name so let's just say this is um four five six main street okay
so the address is four five six main street and this campaign name this is for your eyes only i just usually like to name it whatever i am naming
the or whatever the addresses of the listing
and then let's say the price is four hundred thousand
okay and this we're filling this information out right here and this is gonna automatically help us create the facebook ad the landing page
and the email and text messaging <unk> for you okay so you just put in a few details right here and it's gonna <unk> this ad
the landing page and all the follow-up for you okay so let me just show you guys this okay total number of bedrooms let's say it's four bedrooms three bathrooms
and it is in salt lake city okay in the home description this is where you spend a little bit more time um i'm not gonna spend a ton of time on this video
because i don't want you have to watch me write all this stuff out all right so i just tied this out for you but look at this i put beautiful home with vaulted ceilings and a half acre lot with playground in the backyard for the kids
<unk> garage for all your toys and tools and located near the best schools in the area with two amazing parks now if you look at that home description
you can kind of get a feel of who i'm targeting i'm targeting a family with kids right beautiful home with half acre lot with the playground the backyard for the kids
<unk> garage for the toys located near the best schools two amazing parks so if you're showing this to somebody in your area that has kids these are all things that they're gonna be interested in
and so that's gonna even pick more interest for them to actually click on your ad and opt in to become a lead so now we're just going to go through and throw in an image of the home so i'm just gonna grab that from my desktop
so let's go like that hit open then we're gonna click on next right there and then look at this this is super cool guys it says where would you like to leave the lead to go after opting in
so after they put in their name phone number email address onto your landing page where would you like to send them would you like to send them to your facebook page your website
book an appointment to a buyer on facebook messenger bot a seller messenger bot where would you like to send them so for this example i'm just gonna say book an appointment
because that honestly is kind of like the key to all this we want people to book appointments with us right
so it automatically <unk> with this link from your facebook page and i'm gonna show you guys here in just a second once we create this um the whole process a to z of what this looks like
so we're just gonna click on next right here and then we're gonna go through and set up our budget so this is so that we can go through and create this for you

if you're new here then make sure you click that big subscribe button and all the links to everything are mentioned in this video you can find linked in the description box below so let's jump into it
facebook live is an awesome tool for growing and engaging an audience with some very simple tips and some very quick pre <unk> preparation you can easily get professional results
so we're gonna run through seven steps to help you do just that
but as we're going through don't get too excited with any one specific tip and jump off and try to implement it straight away
we're giving you a process here with tips along the way that you can implement for you next livestream
and i'm also gonna share my number one tool for getting more viewers on your shining new professional looking facebook livestream
and while we're going through make sure you let us know in the comments what your number one tip is for maximizing results when going live on facebook
alright so first off before you go live there's a few things you need to do number one is to plan your content
so what you want for that is a simple structure of everything that you're going to cover well everything you want to cover in you livestream
so your structure will have things like a hook which is before the introduction this is the thing that hooks your viewer to stick around for your live
you also then want an introduction to talk about the things that you're gonna cover in the video then you can jump in to the actual content itself
after you've delivered the content make sure to have a recap or a summary to summarize everything that you've given them
and then a call to action which is the next step that you want your viewers to take after your facebook live has finished
such a really simple structure not just for your facebook lives but also for your videos as well number two is to pick a location
now you wanna pick a location that matches your videos that you're actually creating you want somewhere that's quite somewhere that's out of the way
you don't wanna be getting distracted or interrupted while you're actually live
we've all seen that video where the little kid walks in during a livestream
you don't want that to happen for you so try and pick somewhere out of the way somewhere that is quite with as little environmental variables as possible
so that's things like light changing outside or clouds coming over trucks or planes making a heap of noise
you wanna try and pick somewhere nice and quite where you can just focus on delivering the content
you also wanna make sure that you're not picking a location that is distracting for your viewers you want your viewers to focus on you and the content you're delivering and not being distracted with what's going on behind you
step number three is to test your internet before you go live it's a really good idea to at least have an understanding of how good or how bad your internet is
so if you head over to speed test dot net or you can download the app for your iphone or for your android device and run a speed test for the internet connection that you're connected to
the most important thing that you're looking for here is that number one that the internet you've got is stable and that that little speed test isn't bouncing around all over the place
but also you wanna focus on your upload speed too yeah upload speed is what's important here not so much your download speed
and you wanna make sure that ideally you've got at least two to two point five <unk> per second upload
if you've got two to two point five <unk> per second upload then that will be enough for facebook live but you do need to be aware of other people that are sharing the same internet connection
if you're on an office wi-fi or work connection other people may start downloading files and kill the internet for you
so you wanna run a few tests not just one run a few ideally fifteen to twenty minutes before then a few minutes out as well
so then you can really get an understanding of where your internet speed is at now if your internet speed is less than two to two point five <unk> per second then you've got two options
you can either try to find a different connection or a different location or to use l t e instead of wifi or use your mobile data
or you could still go live with the connection that you have but just be aware that you might have some issues
and what do we do in that circumstances if i'm gonna go live and i know that the internet speed isn't <unk> percent
then one of the very first things i would do when i am live is to let my viewers know that we maybe experiencing problem
because you're not sure how good the internet is in that location so at least that expectation has been met in case there's any issues with your stream
then obviously then if you're running your speed test and you've got higher than two point five <unk> per second upload then you shouldn't have any issues at all
step number four is to get everything set up so this means setting up your camera setting up your tripod if you're gonna be using the tripod
make sure everything is stable everything is at the correct height that you've got your audio and your light and everything set up ready to go for your facebook livestream
now obviously this is gonna depend if you're using a camera if you're using your phone or if you're just using your laptop and a web cam to go live
and there is obviously different recommended gear for the different scenarios
but i will link up in the card now to some of that recommended gear for going live on facebook live from your smartphone
simple things like having a portable microphone and a mini <unk> so that you're getting the phone out of your hands
and into a stable position and that's really important no matter what type of video or live you're creating get your phone or your camera out of your hands and get it somewhere stable
use a tripod if you can or just position your camera somewhere where it's not gonna shake and move around a lot for your lives
now if you're using a mac or a p c to go live you can use similar gear as well and you can either just use your facebook browser to go live
or you can use software like e cam or exploit v mix o b s <unk> there is a heap of options out there for facebook live
we're shooting another video that we've just released and i'll link that up in the cards as well covering off a heap of different options for going live on facebook
but no matter which way you're going live the important thing is to make sure that everything is set-up correctly and how you want it with as much or as little gear as you have before you go live
you don't wanna be tweaking and changing things while you're live and that leads us right into step number five which is to do a test broadcast
so this is where once you've got everything sorted press the live button but make sure that the live broadcast is only going to just you that it's a private live
so in the facebook settings you get to choose who you wanna broadcast to and there is an option there to broadcast to only me or just yourself
so that way there's no one else that will see it so what you're looking for in this test is that everything looks good sounds good that everything is set up the way that you'd like it
now if you are going live in a sales scenario or you're doing this for a live promotion
now it also suggest that while you're running this live that you do a quick run through of the content you're gonna be presenting as well
so that way you'll feel more relaxed cuz you've had a run through but also when you're watching back you can give yourself some feedback on how you went in your live test
step number six is to tell people that you are about to go live now this could be as simple as sending out some tweets or some instagram posts or facebook to let people know
but there is also a really cool way to automatically post and e-mail as soon as you go live with a cool app called live leap so i'm gonna cover that off in a few minutes
but there are some ways to automate that process as well and step number seven is to go live so the first thing you do when you go live should be to deliver the hook
start talking to people as if you're delivering the content and the video structure that you had planned out don't stop to welcome everybody in and start some idle <unk> with people
because that won't fly for the people that are watching the replay they're gonna loose that connection with you so focus on the hook and then get straight into the content beyond that
while you're live you also wanna make sure that you are making eye contact directly with your viewers which means looking at the camera lens
not looking off to the side your viewers would be out of notice if you're not looking or talking directly to them
so you wanna make sure that you're looking directly down your camera lens so you're making that eye contact and that deep connection with your viewers
now it's likely that while you're live you also wanna interact with your audience
but it's really important here to try and batch all your live interactions into certain areas of your livestream
you definitely don't wanna break the content that you're delivering or the key teachings and learnings for your viewers with you
dropping off and saying hi to someone as they come in or answering a comment immediately so for some <unk> it could be that you break every few minutes throughout
or in some cases you might wanna save it all until the end of your video to do some interacting or some live q and a
however you decide to do it make sure you let your viewers know how it's going to work and when you're gonna be answering their questions and when you're gonna be covering off the content as well
and also be aware of anything that changes audio wise in your livestream as well
so if you are filming outside and a big truck pulled up next to you then you might be able to pick up and move to another location while you're still live and presenting and interacting
so that your viewers can actually still hear what you're saying instead of having it drowned out by a truck or some other noise
and the last thing to remember while you're live is to have fun with your livestream
if you're not having fun then it's gonna be very difficult for your viewers to engage with you and have fun as well so it all comes down to you have fun with your <unk> and your viewers will enjoy it too
now i did mention live leap a few minutes ago

if you're new here then make sure you click that subscribe button and all the links to everything we mention in this video you can find linked in the description box below so let's jump into it
now there's a lot of facebook live software options available out there and we've reviewed a bunch of them individually in the past we've also played around with a lot of other ones as well
the landscape though is always changing with constant updates so in this video we put all the major players head to head comparing the pros and cons
to help you decide which is the best for your facebook live streams so whether it's <unk> interviews live screen sharing or <unk> chat
or just fancy branding or animations third-party facebook live software can unlock a huge range of functionality that you just can't get with facebook standard apps
so in this video we're gonna tap on my top solutions for the most popular types of facebook live streams including <unk> more than <unk>
and live with screen sharing capabilities and make sure you stick around to the end because i'm also gonna give you my number one tip for automatically sharing your facebook live links
to get more of your audience on to your live streams the moment you go live so these are in no particular order and they rang in price from free to <unk> and <unk> dollars
what's best for you will depend on what you're you looking to achieve the platforms and devices you're using and your budget so make sure you stick around to hear the full six
so that you don't miss out so straight off the bat the first one that we need to mention is the facebook website
the easiest way to go live in a lot of cases is just to use the facebook website with your webcam choose to create a new post and click live
and then you're broadcasting live directly from your laptop or computer with just your webcam so it's probably the easiest way to go live
from your desktop without the need for any other software or platform so the biggest advantage with this is that you don't need anything else you're not paying for any subscriptions
you've literally got got all that you need in the facebook website and with a recent update you can now share your computer screen on your facebook lives just using the facebook website as well
so the biggest disadvantage is then that you don't have any advanced controls so you don't have the ability to bring anyone else in or to really do anything fancy with your live streaming on facebook
option number two is to use live broadcasting or live streaming software like o b s or open <unk> software and <unk> studio
now both of these are fairly <unk> solutions these will give you a professional range of tools for creating <unk> live streams
things like being able to bring in multiple camera angles and seamlessly switch between them to have multiple screen shares
to really have a full range of control and <unk> over your live streams we have done a full comparison of o b s and comparing it to <unk>
and i will link that up in the cards now if you're interested in that but one of the major differences between the two is the price o b s which runs on mac pc and linux is free one hundred percent free
<unk> studio on the other hand which runs on both mac and pc currently sells for <unk> and <unk> dollars which just actually had a decent price increase from four hundred and ninety five dollars
the biggest difference though between the two is the level of control and <unk> and also the ease of use
<unk> at that price point is much much easier to set up and use and it's actually one of my <unk> solutions for professional live streams
it's what we use for all our client projects in the latest update though from <unk> where they got their price increase as well
they've actually announced a really decent feature a really cool feature which lets you bring in guests to interview them live seamlessly using the <unk> software
so it would be similar to bringing someone in on a skype call so that you can bring someone in and interview them and go live through <unk> as well
now you can do a similar sort of thing with o b s and bring in guests using applications like skype and screen sharing that skype call but it can get pretty complicated and pretty messy
especially when you're trying to sort out your audio issues and removing echo and yeah it's possible but it's definitely complicated and that's probably the biggest thing with these two
they're not for the <unk> you definitely need to invest some time into o b s or <unk> to get up to spread because you've got so much control over your live streams in there
but both of these will not only let you broadcast to facebook live they'll both let you also broadcast to other live streaming platforms like youtube live twitch <unk> and a heap of others out there as well
so both great solutions if you want a really <unk> live stream with multiple cameras and yeah complicated setups
solution number three is a piece of software called <unk> live now <unk> live will work on mac only and you can pick it up for <unk> <unk>
so crazy cheap especially when you're comparing it to <unk> at six hundred and <unk> dollars
so what <unk> live will let you do is broadcast live currently just to facebook live but they have announced that they will have r t m p
or opening up their broadcasting capabilities to other streaming platforms like youtube <unk> and others as well
ah very very soon they've also just announced that they're gonna be integrating skype into <unk> live as well so you will have that ability to use skype
to make calls and live interviews without all the headaches that you can have using <unk> and o b s so that is an amazing feature
and it's crazy that you're getting all of this for under thirty dollars it's actually one of the most complete ways or most polished ways to go live on facebook live
and to be able to see and monitor all your interactions and hearts and comments and things as you're live that you wouldn't normally get on the facebook live mobile app to go live from the app
so it is amazing that you get this in a desktop app again it's currently mac only hopefully somewhere in the future they'll also release a pc version
but if you're on mac this piece of software is an absolute <unk> <unk> live also lets you easily share your computer screen or play back videos as well
so if you've got videos <unk> up that you wanna play in your live stream with the click of a button you can be playing those out and it also supports local disk recording as well
so whatever you're broadcasting live you're also saving that live stream to your computer with a <unk> upload to youtube once you've finished your facebook live stream
so that's pretty cool solution number four is a really popular web platform called <unk> the website is <unk> dot tv
so what this lets you do is run everything from your web browser so you don't need to download any software or install anything which means that you can use this on pretty much on any computer
it seamlessly connects through to any webcam or microphone that you've got set up and running on your computer but also makes it really really easy for you to bring guests into your live stream
so no one needs to download or install any software you literally just send out the link people can join a waiting room where you can see while you're live that they're there waiting
and you can invite them on so you're not limited to just bringing one guest on you can actually have two guests on so three people live on your facebook live stream currently
you also get some amazing control over your facebook live stream so once again you get to see from the <unk> interface all your facebook comments
you get to see how many people are watching you can actually promote or feature comments on your live stream
all you have to do is when someone's made a comment that you wanna feature or promote you click on it and it will be made big on the live stream for everyone to see
so that's an amazing feature especially if you're gonna be doing live q and a as with your audience you can bring up the question or the comment that you're going to be addressing
so a really cool feature and it's so easy to use this is probably the easiest app out of all the ones we've mentioned and going to be mentioning
besides number one the facebook website itself this is the easiest one to use it's the most intuitive interface ah it's really for anyone beginner through to advanced
<unk> also lets you share your computer screen easily as well and there's also templates that are setup or <unk> that are setup in <unk>
so when you click them you can change what the view or the display is like for your viewers
so with the click of a button you can switch between a <unk> view of yourself to a <unk> screen split with yourself and someone that you've got on your live stream
or you can easily split to a <unk> split where you've got three people side by side so not only is this an amazing platform for going live
it's also really amazing how easy it is to use to setup something like this in o b s or in <unk> would take a huge amount of time to setup
but also to manage while you're live now there's four pricing options for <unk> tv there is a free plan which gives you twenty minutes free broadcasting twice a week
there's a <unk> plan for twelve dollars per month which lets you do things like add a custom logo branded colors and you've got a limit of sixteen broadcast per month
then above that you've got your standard package which is twenty dollars per month and here the biggest difference is that it's unlimited broadcasts per month
and your also get access to the advanced features like screen sharing custom branded frames and also early access to new features as they become available
and the other plan above that is the enterprise plan which at five hundred dollars per month is probably gonna rule this out for a lot of people here
with the additional features listed as telephone support custom graphics and custom formats as well
so i would imagine for most people the <unk> plan or the standard plan would be what you're after
number five is zoom now zoom is another online platform but this one has the big advantage of being able to bring in a heap of guests into your live streams
live streaming to facebook and youtube from zoom is actually a relatively new feature that they've added it did start out as a video conferencing software and now they've bought in some more <unk> tools as well
which obviously let you go live on places like facebook and youtube in zoom you get a heap of advanced controls over
the people that you're bringing into your call weather it's just you and you've got other people as guests or whether you want to bring other people in as panelists or <unk>
whether their <unk> are on by default or muted where you can control all of that while you're live as well it's also got <unk> polling it's got a built-in chat window
so you can interact with your audience while you're live from inside the zoom call as well
one of the big advantages with zoom is how easy it is to create the live call or the live link and get that sent out to your participants or guests that are going to be on the call
so you have the the call automatically scheduled and entered into your calendar so there's a heap of really professional functionality and reminders that are built in
all around scheduling the call and making sure that your guests are there and in the right place and also helping them test their audio and their webcam as they join the call
to make sure that everything is working one of the other really powerful features of zoom is not only does it let you record your
call or your live directly to your local computer but it also gives you the ability to record your calls and save them in the cloud as well
and when you enable the cloud recording it actually records two files for you it records the speaker view which is the default view
which changes based on whoever is talking so it's the <unk> version of whoever is speaking and switches automatically but it also gives you the gallery view as well
so if you've got a few people on there then it would show everyone on the screen for that recording so to have that ability you're able to record in two separate files
the two different camera views is amazing so in regards to pricing in order to use zoom for live streaming you need to be on their pro plan which costs fourteen <unk> per month
but you're also gonna need to add the webinar <unk> to actually go live which cost an additional forty dollars per month
so in order to go live on facebook with zoom you will be spending <unk> dollars per month
so now on to number six which is <unk> now <unk> and zoom are fairly similar in regards to product offering both of them will let you have live polling
so you can ask questions to your people watching and see the results in real time they'll both have chat they'll both handle questions but <unk> is probably a more polish solution at least for webinars anyway
what you get in <unk> though after your live stream is some really advanced detail and analytics about the people that were there
how long they stayed for where they came in from so the level of analytics and data that you're able to capture in <unk> is pretty amazing
<unk> also has integration with <unk> and with drip meaning you can get some great data and analytics through from your live calls into your c r m which is a really cool feature
<unk> also has a <unk> feature which is actually what you'll need to be a broadcast your <unk> call or meeting onto facebook live
but this <unk> feature also let you broadcast to multiple live platforms as well so whether that's multiple facebook live pages accounts groups events or you could broadcast live to facebook and youtube at the same time
in regards to pricing <unk> has three pricing options
the first is their live package at <unk> dollars per month then they've got a professional package at <unk> dollars per month and that's actually the one that you're going to need
if you wanna be doing lives to facebook live or youtube live and there's also a business plans as well for <unk> and <unk> dollars per month
so it's definitely not on the cheaper end of things so the main difference when you're comparing the professional package to the business package is the number of live attendees
it goes from two hundred and fifty up to five hundred and the cost for an extra live <unk> goes from thirty cents down to fifteen cents on the business plan
but keep in mind that these numbers for attendees aren't in relation to facebook live this is only for people that are attending your call or your webinar on the actual platform
if you're gonna using this for facebook live which is what we're talking about in this video then there may not be anyone that's actually attending on the actual platform
they'll be watching and interacting with you through facebook live so if all you're interested in is using <unk> for facebook lives then you'll definitely be able to get away with the professional plan
so those are our top six solutions for creating awesome facebook lives whether it's bringing in screen share bringing in one guest two guests or a heap of guests into your lie streams
now as we said there was a huge range in price there's also a huge range in features and capabilities for the different solutions
now before we get to mind number one tip to automatically getting more of your audience on your live stream as soon as you go live let's do a quick recap of the options
and who i'd recommend each for so if you just wanna go live on facebook the simplest and easiest way with no additional guests then you can just use the facebook website
if you're after the most amount of control for your live streams and you wanna bring in multiple screen shares multiple cameras and guests and things as well
then you can look at o b s or <unk> as a professional solution then if you're on a mac and you're looking for a really cheap and easy way to create a professional live stream
where you get the full interaction with facebook comments and interactions then check out <unk> live
if you're looking for a really easy way to do a <unk> live a <unk> live and again be able to monitor the comments and feature your comments then <unk> tv might be the answer for you
and if you wanna do a facebook live with two people three people four people or a lot more then you can look at something like zoom which is a cheap alternative to <unk> which will also let you do the same thing
but it's gonna give you more analytics and integrations with things like <unk>
so now for my tip to help you get more of your audience onto your facebook lives automatically the solution is to use live leap
now live leap is a service that helps you automatically share out your facebook lives automatically the moment that you go live
so whether you're going live to a facebook page a group or an event it's automatically gonna share it out to your audience on whatever pages groups twitter even
or even put a link on your website saying that you're currently live on facebook so this is something if you're serious about doing facebook lives that i can't recommend strongly enough
it is the easiest way to automatically share out your lives the moment that you go live without you needing to do anything across a heap of different social platforms
including your website so i'll put a link down in the description below if you wanna check out live leap
now if you're going live on facebook from your smart phone there are some simple low-cost gear that can help you get much better results
check out the video linked on screen now for the best facebook live gear for both iphone and android i'll see you soon
in this video we're gonna run through exactly how to livestream to multiple platforms at the same time or how to <unk>
whether it's to youtube live facebook live twitch almost any other platform we've got you covered in this video
hey it's justin brown here from primal video where we help you amplify your business and brand with video
if you're new here make sure to click that subscribe button and all the links to everything we mention in this video you can find linked in the description box much below
so let's just jump into it now with some simple tools these days it's really easy to livestream to multiple platforms in fact there's even a name for it and it's called <unk>
so that means you can easily create one livestream and push it out to multiple live platforms
or streaming sources like facebook live youtube live twitch and a ton of other platforms as well
now we actually did a video this topic a little while back but since then so much has changed and it has now become so much easier to be able to do this
so i thought it was time to update that video and run through the new best ways to do this or the new options to be able to do this
and while we're going through it i wanna hear from you guys what social or content platforms are you most active on when it comes to live streaming
we're gonna start to pick up our game a little bit on the youtube live side of things but we may look at other platforms too thanks to <unk>
now you've really got two main options when it comes to <unk> to multiple platforms
the first one is to push out multiple streams from your broadcasting software now this is really only possible in software like <unk> or ah like <unk>
where you're able to set up multiple output sources so instead of just sending your livestream feed to youtube you're also able to add in an additional stream
for facebook or for twitch or wherever else you'd like to broadcast to
so that was pretty much what we have covered the first time we tackled this and i'll put a link up to that video because that method still does work
but the biggest downside with that is that you're actually pushing those multiple streams from your one computer and from your one internet connection
which means it can put your computer under load but it also can put your internet bandwidth under load
so if you are going to be pushing multiple streams you will need at least twice the available bandwidth
or if you're running three stream you'll need three times the bandwidth that you would for one stream across each of the individual streams to be i don't pushed them all out
the other big downside of <unk> that way was the interactions or the comments they were all separate there was no way to pull them all together
so you can bring in comments from youtube twitch and facebook all into one chat window for you running the stream to be able to monitor them in one place
you literally had to go to facebook and then over to twitch and then over to youtube to be able to see each one of those different comment feeds
so while all that was doable it was a pain to set up and it could be rather frustrating to manage and see everything while you're actually live
but the option that i'm about to show you now option number two will require no additional bandwidth will put your computer under no additional load and you'll be able to use a larger arrange of <unk> software
or platforms to be able to do this
so what i'm talking about here is a <unk> or a <unk> platform that you send your livestream to them and they push it out to the different platforms for you
now there are quite a few platforms out there that offer this service of <unk> and <unk> your content out for you
and in there you've got a massive range from super basic right up to enterprise grade and obviously the enterprise grade ones are gonna come with the enterprise price tag
so there's really three main options when it comes to those of us that are looking just to push our <unk> out to multiple places without the need for enterprise stuff
and the three most popular and my top three are <unk> <unk> and <unk>
now all three of these make it really simple to push your livestream out to multiple sources at the same time
so they all support things like youtube live facebook live twitch all the popular ones and they also have r t m p so you can really push your livestream out to anywhere
using that r t m p protocol
they also all have integrated comments or integrated chat meaning that no matter which services you're broadcasting to you can pull in the chat to one central location
making it easy for you to either bring those comments and those chat elements up <unk> in your livestream or just to make it easy for you to monitor
and interact with people while you're live and all three of those also have global servers where you can manually pick the fastest servers or the servers closest to you
to <unk> out your livestream with the lowest latency meaning that it's not gonna add a delay or a big delay to your livestream for those watching on the different platforms
it's really going to be almost instant if you're picking a server that is close to your location
now it's also important to note that facebook live is actually treated a little different it's treated separately from pretty much all the other broadcast platforms out then you'll see that when we get to the pricing options
of <unk> services and how they treat facebook but it's all to do with the way that facebook actually lets you broadcast live to them
and in some of these cases you're gonna have to pay a little bit extra or a lot more to be able to broadcast to facebook or to multiple facebook locations
now i'm gonna quickly run through some of the <unk> pros and cons for each of these three for <unk> for <unk> and for <unk> to help you better decide which one is going to be the pick for you
but this really isn't a full comprehensive review of feature comparison of the three this is just the <unk> pros and cons as far as i'm concerned
to really help you narrow down which one of these is going to be the best fit for you
alright so <unk> or <unk> dot i o is probably the most popular and most people's go to platform for <unk> or getting their livestream out to multiple places
it is by far the most feature rich but its also probably the most <unk> or the hardest to use
it's got the most advanced control in regards to the chat or the comment feeds
and it's also got a p i integration so that's it's really easy to integrate that chat roll into your live streaming software like <unk> and o b s
it also has built in live <unk> which means that you can <unk> or convert your livestream into different formats different qualities different sizes
while you're live to match different platforms that you might be broadcasting live to
and another great feature is that <unk> don't limit the amount of bandwidth or the <unk> of the quality of your <unk> going in or out of their service
they also make it really easy to resize those different versions so if you're broadcasting a wide screen video and you wanna convert it in <unk>
so that your facebook version is going out in portrait they make that really easy as well
now there's really two main downsides to <unk> the first one i touched on already it's around having all of these extra features but the actual interface isn't super intuitive
or it's not easy to find everything and it can get overwhelming and complicated to go through and just create some simple <unk>
so it's really for probably the more advanced side of things
the second one is that they add their branding to your <unk> up until you reach their pro plan
so on their pro plan they'll let you remove their branding
there's not just the branding inside of your <unk> like a <unk> on it
it's actually into your social media streams as well so in <unk> you can set it up so that when you're live it'll tweet out and and maybe do a facebook post out
but in there it's actually it's got their branding in it it it's got mentions of them and tags them in your posts so i think for anyone that's using this on the business side
um you definitely don't wanna have that going on which means you're going to need to start at the pro plan
so it's not a deal <unk> but it just means that you've gotta be using thee pro plan to get rid of all of that branding
now when it comes to pricing they've split this off into two so you've got individual pricing plans and you've got company pricing plans
if it was a free plan that let you broadcast out your stream to thirty plus streaming platforms
but that doesn't include facebook there's also a standard plan at sixteen dollars per month and that gives you access to livestream to one facebook channel
and also gives you the ability in real time to switch or toggle between or on or off the different live streaming platforms
and then you've got the professional plan which is <unk> dollars per month this will give you access to three facebook channels and also it takes the branding off as well
now the <unk> that i mentioned just before is an additional two dollars per hour for the length of your livestream
now up from that they do have premium business and enterprise plans available as well
and this gives you access to five facebook channels on the premium and fifteen facebook channels on the business now we see the enterprise one is for those that are really crazy serious above and beyond that point
the next option you've got is <unk> or <unk> dot live now this is another really awesome platform to be able to <unk> your <unk> out
they've got a really intuitive really easy to use interface it's so easy to quickly jump in
link up your channels your facebook pages and those sorts of things and start to broadcast out from there
once again they've got really great chat integration not quite to the level that you get in <unk> but still really solid and still they make it pretty easy to get it into your live streaming programs as well
and you've also got <unk> capabilities again to push the different versions for different platforms but one of the cool features that you've got inside of <unk> is
that for each one of the broadcasts that you have or each one of the platforms that you're broadcasting to you can totally customize them up
to have even individual branding so your facebook livestream could have different branding to your youtube livestream which has totally different branding to your twitch <unk>
so even while the content that you're broadcasting out from your computer is the same you've got a different version or different logos and those sorts of things on each of them
all managed through <unk> even little things like being able to bulk start and stop streams and multiple streams is just so easy to do inside of <unk> so they make a lot of this stuff really really easy
it's now when regards to the downsides of <unk> i think most of these are really based around their pricing models
and the restrictions that come in at the different pricing models so first off there's no free option but there is a <unk> dollar per month professional plan
and that's actually their lowest entry level plan now they do have a fourteen day trial available
but on that plan your <unk> are going to be restricted to five <unk> per second and at a maximum resolution of <unk> p
but they'll let you broadcast out simultaneously to five providers and two of those include facebook
now they also have restrictions around the duration of your <unk> and your <unk> as well
on their professional plan you are limited to fifty hours per month
and twelve hours per livestream now depending on the type and the amount of <unk> that you're actually doing none of those may come into effect
may affect you too much but they do have two other plans listed on their website for business and for enterprise but neither one of them has pricing available
so you need to reach out if you're interested in pricing for those but obviously with those a lot of those restrictions
have been moved or raised
so now for the third option which was <unk> or <unk> dot i o now this is probably the new kid on the block
and it's actually probably the most compelling offer as well and the one that i'm the most excited about there you go just spoilt the rest of the video for you
but this is the one that i think is going to be the <unk> going forward and could really have a big impact
on the other two options moving forward now <unk> once again is really easy to use
but i think the biggest reason that <unk> is super easy to use is that it's not filled with all the additional features and bells and whistles
as the other two that we've seen now there's no ads there's no bandwidth limitations and there's no stream time or limits
on how long you can actually broadcast for they even say on their on their website that you could stream twenty-four seven through their platform if you wanted to
other big feature that <unk> has is the ability to do cloud recording so you can actually do a full recording of whatever it is you are <unk>
without needing to save it locally on your computer
and just like the other two it does have integrated chat as well
and they even show you on their website how to bring it into places like <unk>
now what <unk> doesn't have straight out of the box anyway is those <unk> and <unk> options that you had in <unk> and in <unk>
but they do have another service offering that ties in with <unk> that does give you access to all of those things if you need them
so now looking at the pricing options i think this is really where <unk> shines i have a free plan with no branding no <unk>
no restrictions around bandwidth or the amount of time you can livestream for totally free they will let you share that out to five publishing locations
including one facebook channel they also have a nine dollar <unk> per month plan which gives you up to ten publishing locations
and two facebook channels and for <unk> <unk> you get unlimited locations and five facebook channels
now like i said at the start of the video we're not getting into the <unk> gritty of each of these three platforms we are specifically looking at
<unk> and broadcasting your livestream out to multiple platforms these are in my opinion the best three to do that and you can also see
that they're all so completely different offerings now if you're someone who is on the more advanced side of things and you're looking for all the features all the controls
all the bells and whistles then you're really probably not gonna be looking at <unk> you're gonna be more looking at <unk> or at <unk>
now obviously with those two which one is gonna be the best fit for you you've really gotta come back to those pricing tables and see what the restrictions are
and what you actually get access to for those different plans
but if you're someone who's not looking for all those advance features and really wants the best bang for buck to be able to get your broadcast out to multiple platforms
then it's really gonna go hands down to <unk> i really think that what they're offering especially for the price and even on the free plan is just insane and it's
again it's easy to get up and running and get it working with your <unk> platform so i'm gonna quickly log in to <unk> and show you how easy it is to get set up
once you're logged in all you need to do is go to add a stream and choose new <unk>
and pop-up on the side to give your stream a name let's just go test
one and select your region
i'm in australia now so i'll pick sydney but clue choose the closest one to you
and press save
next all you need to do is to add in the platforms that you wanna broadcast to so you come over here and go add platform
and these are all the supported platforms so you can either choose a custom server or pick one of the ones that are <unk> in here
so let's just use youtube now in this case you need to connect your channel by signing into your youtube channel
or you can use your own server or stream key that's provided in the platform
once you've logged in and it says youtube is connected and saving now this is where you can give your youtube stream a title
test stream
one obviously you wanna come up with something a bit more creative you can also add in your stream description in there as well and hit save down at the bottom
so now that you've got youtube in there we can add in another platform as well just going through the exact same process
so i'll back out of this now cancel that one
so you can queue up all of your different platforms in here
then all you need to all you need to know here is this is your streaming details that you'll put into your live streaming software
so whether it's o b s <unk> <unk> <unk> this is your streaming server and this is your streaming key so once you've set that up

i don't know could be good let me know i'll see you soon
magic gathering is a <unk> card game it's strategic in nature it's got a little bit of hidden information where you're hiding your cards from your opponent
you're playing your cards onto the battle field attacking and blocking with them and trying to reduce your opponent to zero life
people collect the cards like baseball cards
then they play a strategy game with them it's kind of a combination of poker and chess poker in that you play with the cards you draw but chess and then each <unk> like a different pace
from the cards you collect you get to customize your own deck and your own experience and make it your own
when your true foes reveal themselves will you do everything in your power to conquer them
it has a fantasy flavor and feel to it that can be something that's very important to you all the way down to not that important to you at all
one of the things that makes magic accessible to new players is that luck is absolutely going to be a factor unlike a game like chess where you will always loose if you're worse
in magic you sometimes win and its kind of like a little bit of a gateway you know like it helps you feel good while you're learning
magic is the biggest now left ever been by a lot
i think we just certainly upwards to million people playing the game worldwide
no matter which language you speak the rules are ah are the same everywhere your cards might be in english his cards might be japanese but you both can communicate there easily
when i was growing up most people who were you know playing games weren't really seen as the cool kids but now you know there is professional gamers on you know t v
you ah this is just so much more a part of the culture than it was ten fifteen years ago
alright i'm going to play a fifth manner card and then i'm going to attack with my elder beast
can can he block the elder beast
not with his shape <unk> its already dead
more damage to your planes walker
ho yeah no the game is just so polished and so well done
it it might just be the best game ever made
good morning good afternoon good evening and good night
you are welcome to our live exclusive coverage of the final of pro tour born of the gods will it be the ice core shawn <unk> or <unk> jacob wilson
if he wins this match jacob will be the first champion younger than the game of magic
jacob hasn't attacked even once
jacob really needs to not play this <unk> over here
shawn <unk> is it static <unk>
kill your birds of paradise and that is the end shawn <unk> is your champion he is king of the hill
jacob congratulations i can tell of course you're disappointed who wouldn't be
right now i i feel a little physically ill but i think ah tomorrow i can look back and be proud about this and yeah hope to win the next one
yup well come back win the next one <unk> and gentlemen your <unk> a great ambassador for the game jacob wilson good job
the magic pro tour has approach the highest competitive stage for magic there's four major events a year the pro tours that each ah have a quarter million dollar prize pool with forty thousand dollars to the winner
you could only attend the pro tours if you're invited
you have to win or qualify a tournament just to get invited to a tournament that invites you to the pro tour
probably a couple thousand people show up over the course of the weekend you know there's a live broadcast so the pro tours are definitely the marquee events of magic
this is an important tournament for jacob in a big way he had a bitter loss in his first pro tour i remember looking at him after that happened
for somebody who doesn't show that much emotion on a regular basis he was destroyed by that
second place is the most painful position to finish
sometimes people joke about second place being tied for dead last
i think that might've been the first time we saw jacob like you know he has this kind of like flat exterior when he's playing magic
and it was kind of shocking to see him be kind of like almost like crushed to lose in the finals it's like being dropped off a cliff
right when i lost i was kind of in disbelief i had won two out of the first three games and i felt <unk> and i really just thought that it was a guarantee
immediately after i was pretty devastated and definitely bitter i am jacob wilson and i'm a professional magic player
i was introduced to magic when i was really young and when i was fifteen i just start playing in local tournaments like once a week and when i got second place at the pro tour
i ended up going from like a hundred dollars my bank account to thirty thousand and like i was paying for school all by myself
at the beginning of this fall semester i was qualified for the world championships it was a lot of work to do school and magic at the same time so i wanted to take the semester off and just prepare the whole time
right now one of my biggest goals is to win a pro tour and if i were to accomplish that it would be a huge achievement and definitely one of the biggest ones of my life
tonight could definitely be a late night often i'm a little bit too excited to sleep right before a big tournament like this
yeah i i i think it's pretty important to get a good night's sleep ah
i think most people try to
a lot of people used like adderall to flip this stuff like that
i got sleeping pills
yeah
i like to wake up long before the tournament so pretty soon i will be taking a sleeping pill and listen to some music and go to sleep
the pro scene is divided from a lot of people's experience playing magic it can be so many different things to so many different people
for you know the average person who's playing it's much more likely a way that they sort of blow off steam after work or just get together with friends or a way that they bond with their family members
ma worry about the food more
yeah yeah the food almost done
so ma <unk> we cooking today
this is ah <unk> sauce we're gonna have a little picnic and we'll have some stuffed chicken breast for dessert
nice when people get invited to the freedom house they know they're gonna get two things high level vintage magic and great pasta
over there is our collection ah cards that um cards that we use to play ah magic
yeah those cards there could provide a little a lot of hours work lot of hours of fun lot of hours with family and friend recreation so that's really what it is
certain cards even remember what you were when you opened them like the class <unk>
we would always have a fantasy background starting from ah my oldest brothers which are read a lot of <unk> work you know we all read the chronicles of <unk>
and then eventually i stumbled upon magic it was actually in the back of chemistry class
well i'm any jack italian nerd it's part of what makes me me it is a lot of the old stuff right here
savannah lions and jade statues i mean things like this completely um
specifically why this why this savannah lion is kept in plastic is that um it actually single <unk> won <unk> beta black look
that card effectively won this one beta black look
they're very valuable to about nineteen <unk> more we open up a packs you're paying three dollars per pack now if we turn in to sell it it could it could probably be the down payment on our house
i mean it's just absurd what that has to the game
another reason you know that definitely love the game and why we play vintage is the older art work like
sir angels the card i have around simply cause i've always loved the art work
this is the backbone of my deck it's called <unk> workshop
to me i'm very much gravitate towards the art i always appreciated the fantasy art aspect
there was some early pieces of art which had some symbolism which i think provoked people to bring out the bad aspects of fantasy
there were two cards in particular demonic tutor and unholy strength which had <unk> on them
there was such negative <unk> to <unk> activities or
anything to do with sacrifices and burnt offerings and all of these terms just started to surface
magic the gathering so let's see where they're coming from how many of you see a <unk> if you look there it is
exceptional parents why i don't want my kids playing this because i don't like the imagery
here's one of the cards till dead rotting decaying thing that's been in the ground and member it say it that it's an occult game
one of the dangers of this thing is that it's played with the mind how many know that the mind is a very fragile thing
teenage kids their parents still had influence on what they could play
now it's different
they quickly <unk> those <unk> and that really <unk> a lot of the fires of the whole satanic imagery
that negative paradigm at least that followed magic in the beginning years are now over and i think you starting to see now the growth of it is changing
i look at fantasy as one of my little escapes
for those couple hours that i'm playing allows me to just <unk> you know i'll come back to my problem when i'm finished
the pro tour player in particular it's a grind those guys will sleep on someone's couch one wednesday wake up next wednesday anywhere else what i mean it's a grind to those guys
i just wonder how much fun all of them are having damn sure there are people that find <unk> just not for me not for our community
yeah absolutely
we always made a communal we've always believed in in that aspect of it maybe that's why we gravitate and mix it so well
you know we treated one fairly we try and not to make people feel uncomfortable if if they're new we kind of walk with them because no one's bigger than the game
alright the game has to be about community
we would like to welcome you to the pro tour feat <unk> in d c congratulations for qualifying and have a very very good weekend thank you
keep your head straight in front of you if you are looking to the side we may <unk> where you were looking so please keep your head straight ahead of you
i won the first round which is great it's so it's good to get after a good start my opponent forgot something that would have benefited him
like if you forget what your card does it's not my responsibility to remind him
i'm normally pretty quiet with my opponent during the game i don't really like to <unk> chat
he he he can be sometimes quiet he's a he's a real quiet guy i haven't really gotten to know him super well
jacob wilson attacking for league while using path to exile just saw a handshake
he's always very even very calm and always finds the right play
oh he finally swap through how do you beat that so jacob wilson moves on
it's the end of the day and i finish seven to one which is pretty great it's the best record i've ever had at a pro tour i can't really ask for much more
dude you won seven to one today that's fucking insane i know that's great great work thanks
we're holding white bits of paper and that means its time for the end of day wrap jacob wilson is ahead of the curve
you you've already called it there you're saying jacob wilson for the win
a terrific job by him and all these players here on behalf of everyone at wizards of the coast saying bye
alright mama bye
vintage is a great game and not only because of the old nostalgic cards alpha cards the dramatic plays the true reason why it's great is the community
the people that make up the game are amazing everyone's friendly everyone's accepting here you walk into a room and you have forty friends
this is ah vintage ah right now we're doing ah <unk> tournament just getting together with friends and playing cards
my core strategy is generally to stop what he wants to do slowly picture a <unk> <unk>
slowly wrapping around somebody and once he is in a perfect position now he can squeeze at the air out of them
but i have to up get the <unk> cause they has to get in position first that's the best way i could explain what the deck wants to do its planning it out
it's how do you get there <unk> it's stopping your opponent from doing what he wants to while it slowly reeling him in
well i really say about <unk> it really is how the game was intended to be played
if vintage is the ah purest form of the game it ah plays with all the cards from originally printed up until the one's which are being heart of the prices
<unk> of the <unk> that are the creator of of this game they kind of i guess believed there were errors in the original card that were made
and they kind of wanted to put them away in a small place where they can be forgotten about
they definitely left us out in the cold a little bit and that's why ah in the vintage community we had to self regulate why people look at us as the worldwide west because we've had you know a little bit of the culture look from the parent company
my opponent right now is a great phantom he is a very well known in the vintage community we you know we put out some really good players from him
i got into looking at <unk> of cards they probably should have been caught and destroyed by quality control but didn't for example these two
there's actually no physical card here um this has too much blue this has too much black ink there are miss cut cards that come in packs my friend just found these
we really didn't have a story on it you know i thought they were incredible i thought i would get them framed at first but then every time an opportunity came we wanted to get another <unk> i definitely wanted to
anything else in there that's worth seeing
yes but i realized i actually can't show you something in here but i'll show you guys privately yeah that's why i'm stopping you now
what's wrong with it
today is the day it looks like he has this one
and <unk> for he knows are the <unk> and a lot of people do regard them as the creators of these certain deck
anytime you bring up these old decks they're like oh yeah if he already knows who build this and built that
you were talking earlier about pro tours and all these kids are kind of young do you ever think that you would've kind to do that
i tell you what they would i there's a part of me as being an actual competitor i probably wouldn't have mind a small opportunity to have done it
i would have been at the appropriate age right now we're trying to win a world championship in this format that's that's your actual call but the answer to the question i would've given it a chance
welcome to day two of pro tour fate <unk> coming to you live
now when you get to the late stages of the tournament like this there's a lot on the line
jacob wilson has been utterly dominant this weekend but he just suffered a brutal loss in the heads of eric <unk> and if he doesn't make the top eight that last play is gonna come back to haunt him
here we are it's the last round of the day it all comes down to this if jacob wilson wins he advances to the final day if he loses he is done
our first player seth <unk> standing in his way jacob wilson
alright here's lava spike to take jacob wilson down to ten
down to two is jacob
<unk> turning the tables and going on the offensive here he's got his guns blazing against seth and seth has fallen to six
this is just about as close as they get
that's game that's gonna do it jacob wilson has won
he had a single copy of that card in his deck and it showed up at just the right time what are the odds
how do you feel as seth <unk> right now
i wanna throw up
i'm very blessed i almost lost i should things i almost lost even with the ling long i didn't have the things i would've lost
so jacob was about to die to a lethal <unk> of burn spells and then cast a drew his single copy of the white <unk> line to protect himself
and his opponent had one chance to draw something he didn't and pulled out the win
from canada jacob wilson
if i win the pro tour that would be a defining moment of my life magic is the thing i've put the most effort into and winning the pro tour is the biggest accomplishment you can have in magic
hello and welcome to the last quarter final of pro tour theatre forge we are gonna start off with <unk> <unk> against jacob wilson a nineteen year old
returning to the top eight of a modern pro tour made the finals last year
let's get right down to the floor and see who is gonna win between <unk> <unk> and jacob wilson
<unk> hand has everything
jacob is in game three in a two out of three against
<unk> <unk> who is a dutch hall of fame magic player so not an easy opponent
game one <unk> had an instant win combo that involved making an infinite number of fairies that all attack at once for infinite damage
and then in game two jacob was able to survive despite the fact that <unk> rained an anger of the gods that destroyed all of <unk> creatures
but then jacob summoned an elephant soldier called <unk> <unk> that finished the job and killed <unk> in game two so now we re onto game three
<unk> got a very good start but <unk> deck is capable of winning in an eye blink so the suspense is pretty good
voice researches is running through what could he have jacob does not have a lot of outs here things are not looking good for him
gonna put this <unk> twin on this <unk> do you have a response shows the path to exile to <unk> who now will show him the <unk>
and that should be
the game there's the end <unk> <unk> advances to the semi finals over jacob wilson
another great performance from young jacob wilson but it wasn't quite enough against the dutch hall of <unk> i know this has to be so disappointing for him
you're graded on how many top <unk> you've achieved i think that ultimately jacob is gonna embrace that fact
and as he starts stacking up more and more top base you're gonna see him accept the fact that there is something to be gained for making to top eight
even if it isn't winning the tournament and for such a young person he's already off to a great start
there definitely is a balance of skill and luck in magic anybody can win the better players often gonna win but ah that's one of the main appeals i think
having a variety of experience is possible because of the element of chance is a huge part of just games be it
<unk> ever changing and the card are continuing to be good the sets they produce continue to be excellent and if that stopped then magic would take a step back but
you know if you're gonna keep making great cards and making the game interesting and the game's gonna continue to ah to really excel
you know magic is twenty years old you know magic is old enough that ah there are people who played the game when they were younger who are sharing it with you know their younger generations
good game g g g g okay you wanna play another round
yeah let's go
we've been playing this for twenty years now it's such really a part of us that i'm expecting to be at b t tours twenty years from now and i'm expecting to be the old man
and when someone looks at me and he's <unk> years old and he says oh i guess this old guy doesn't know what he's doing he's in for a shock he's in for surprise to know that i'm playing this for forty years
as long as i have the faculties to play it i will play
i'm definitely enjoying magic right now and i can see playing it for a while if this year does go poorly and i don't make platinum i'd also be happy to go back to school and try
to put more of my effort into that
this is the one <unk> in richmond i'm here with our champion jacob wilson congratulations man with a hand shake that's a little bit of hardware you're no stranger to this
yeah i'll put these with my other one
okay um seven cards right
alright seven cards
it's really fun just started playing today and i'm decent
you're decent i'm a <unk> i've
we're both <unk>
huh but we're okay
we're teaching each other kind of huh
we're learning
you kidding me right now i just need land one land and i can destroy you
you had nothing you scrub
i didn't know anything about magic until today except for that it was a card game and now i'm already obsessed with it
fire emblem this magnificent franchise pushes the boundaries of gaming by daring to ask the question what if chess made you horny
fire emblem is turning thirty next year and with sixteen main games and a few <unk> it's safe to say that it has grown into something extraordinary the games are packed with deep story lines and memorable characters like <unk>
that's not <unk> <unk> that's which one is <unk>
the problem with having such a prolific series is that the characters start to blend together one needs only to look at the super smash bros roster to see that fire emblem characters are a bit hard to differentiate
ah it's like trying to remember your coworkers names after meeting them once at a work mixer except in this case your coworkers all have swords and can only make one facial expression
but do not worry there is an answer to this conundrum because today i'm going to teach you how to tell apart every fire emblem character
my face is just not built for this expression
first step in this process is to collect a list of the characters turns out even after trimming the <unk> ones and the ones from the tokyo mirage sessions there are nearly six hundred fire emblem characters
i cannot explain that many characters i have made that mistake before trying to categorize all six hundred <unk> monsters was a bad idea but the beauty of making mistakes is that you can learn from them
and i now understand that explaining six hundred discrete characters wouldn't actually be helpful human beings aren't meant to remember six hundred people perfectly if you don't believe me just try to remember something about every single person in your contact list
i have a contact for someone name <unk> and in the company it just says <unk> ball
who the fuck is this but unlike my contact list fire <unk> have <unk> and in my experience playing these games i noticed that a lot of these different characters fit similar roles in their respective games
and i'm not the only one who's noticed this on the fire emblem wiki there is a whole list of <unk> based on different characters a list that i only found after spending a whole day trying to categorize them on my own
and it's just so fun to realize that you've wasted a whole day of work but this list intrigued me stock characters in similar circumstances playing again and again in different stories
does that remind you of anything of course it does it reminds you of the <unk> <unk> because it reminds me of the <unk> <unk> and it's so obviously the <unk> <unk> that i don't need to explain it
but i will for the sake of extending this video the <unk> <unk> was an italian form of theater that was big in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries and it relied on stock characters wearing masks or costumes to designate who they were
that way the audience could be like ah that <unk> wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches that must be <unk> the servant clown <unk> two masters this brought the audience in immediately they knew what that character was about without any <unk>
in the same way fire emblem has dozens of recurring characters that get you through each game and this is how we're going to tell them apart by defining their <unk>
fire emblem goes one step further because these characters can not only serve the same story purpose but they can have a similar role in the game play
and this goes to prove my theory that fire emblem is not only the spiritual successor to <unk> <unk> it is its natural evolution an elevated form i call the <unk> <unk>
the newer more perfect form of theater we just have to boil down the fire emblem personnel into <unk> stock characters let's begin with the <unk> that are standard
<unk> and abel are battle bros they fight together but not in the biblical sense <unk> and cords are similar except they're usually axe fighters <unk> sisters are a trio of flying horses ladies
you can't split these <unk> up into their solo characters because their bond is what defines them you can't have a <unk> without a <unk> and in the same way you can't have a <unk> without a cord which is my favorite doctor <unk> book
<unk> are mentors that are strong in the beginning and then you'll quickly <unk> them and it's kind of sad like the first time you beat your dad in a basketball game <unk> are similar to <unk> except they'll keep <unk> on you till you're dead
<unk> are mentors but for magic <unk> are mentors but only the last half of the game <unk> are mercenaries that you have to pay actual in game currency to recruit and <unk> are mercenaries that usually decide to join you out of their own <unk>
which is by definition not a mercenary <unk> are silent moody sword <unk> kind of like if that person who said they studied the blade actually studied the blade there are also a bunch of villains but for different reasons
power ambition loyalty <unk> riding i guess and getting possessed which is a classic mistake
some <unk> are based on their game play requirements very difficult to recruit usually recruited after they've been kidnapped late game recruits that could be good but you have to work hard super low level villagers that could also be good and if you recruit one of these pairs
you can't get the other kind of like if two of your friends start dating and then have a really messy breakup <unk> are usually the parental figure to the main character and they have this nasty habit of getting <unk> super early on in the game
it's kind of like fire emblem doesn't know how to make interesting characters without making them suffer traumatic parental death
<unk> young female <unk> young female <unk> young male <unk>
thieves
<unk> do that thing where they pretend to be not important and then surprise i wasn't an old <unk> i was a magical witch the whole time except they're not very good at hiding the fact that they're important and the creepy version of the <unk> the <unk>
usually they take the form of a small girl or adolescent except they're really four hundred years old and a god or a dragon and i honestly do not have the time to unpack this bullshit
these <unk> <unk> are useful but they only cover two hundred and <unk> characters there are still three hundred and <unk> to go if we keep this up we're going to end up with seventy-five <unk>
the <unk> <unk> only has about seventeen so before we move on let's combine some these six are all mentors to varying degrees of usefulness these are all defined by their <unk> and only some of them become <unk>
welcome to <unk> siblings incorporated where we all have a sibling like bond and do the same job these all have very specific requirements for recruiting these both do that thing where they don't seem important and then surprise i'm important
these are all hard to make good but they're worth it if you put the effort in these are all <unk> little magic babies and that leaves the <unk> <unk> but that's because i'm changing the <unk> to spicy swords
because we can include so many other characters if we just expand the definitions to any sword <unk> who's a little spicy
in fact by combining these other <unk> there are now tons of other characters who fit into these expanded definitions we are left with two hundred and <unk> characters to categorize
but before i get there i just want to commend fire emblem for have five hundred and <unk> <unk> characters and only repeating three names when i was hired for my first job at a climbing gym i was one of five employees named brian
and it was a small gym but i guess it's pretty easy to cut out <unk> when you use <unk> names like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i could go on all day but i won't because it's time to get the rest of the <unk> on the wall
that took like thirty minutes but let's begin the honorable knight like fiona who cares passionately about her people and will always oppose cruelty to civilians
which is way better than the loyal knight like <unk> who only is loyal to <unk> and will do literally anything for him even though <unk> is a bad dude but i'll get to that later
these four <unk> are calm and aloof and the only thing that differentiates them is how much you would want to invite them to your birthday party i'm just gonna get the blank slate <unk> out of the way now because fire emblem is a game with <unk>
and so sometimes you just need more meat for the grinder you know similar to the blank slate is the protagonist which is always relatively heroic but since they're a <unk> for the player they're all pretty vague
i realize that by <unk> them all together into one category i've made the majority of the fire emblem roster in super smash indistinguishable
but that's not my fault super smash should've included more magic babies <unk> <unk> and <unk> all have a mean side but <unk> like <unk> just think they're the best <unk> like <unk> want to fight anything that moves
and <unk> like <unk> <unk> joker accounts <unk> a lot of these characters have rough <unk> but then turn out cheerful despite that and then there's the inferiority complex <unk> which i could have just called the majority of children in fire emblem <unk>
<unk> mischief makers and <unk> are all highly motivated but <unk> is motivated to meet high expectations <unk> is motivated to make intricate schemes and <unk> is motivated to be a <unk>
<unk> are just characters that aren't very fun to talk to and fire emblem i will never forgive you for naming an <unk> uber religious <unk> dad gilbert it also doesn't help that i look like <unk> <unk>
oh god am i a <unk> a lot of these <unk> are based around one singular personality trait <unk> straightforward <unk> chill <unk> lazy <unk> clumsy <unk> a <unk> and <unk> is a furry
dramatic painter and fashionable are defined by their love of the arts and how much it sucks that they gotta be a soldier instead some <unk> upset the status quo by defying gender norms or by calling out the noble class and that's why they're comrades
child soldier karin is <unk> fourteen years old
<unk> but even if they aren't a child they could still be naive which brings around the over protective <unk> which is just essentially helicopter parents
<unk> is constantly drinking and flirting and just being a hot mess and i love her for it and that makes her the president of vices
the vice president but be careful not to do that around someone like <unk> who is constantly accusing people of treason for no good reason
there's a lot of characters in the meek murderer <unk> because fire emblem loves to make characters that are quiet and shy and really self conscious and then can wreck shop on the battlefield
here's an <unk> i call what the fuck and it's the three characters that make me say what the fuck fire emblem people like <unk> who is said to be a sweet robin hood type except he does <unk> a young girl and keeps her as his slave
or <unk> who practices curses on her own daughter or roger who is actually he's not actually that bad
but fire emblem does go out of their way to make his end screen say that he never gets a date and he stays single for the rest of his life and it's like what the fuck fire emblem you didn't have to do him dirty like that
the next <unk> is called actually pretty interesting these characters are three dimensional and well-developed people like libra who struggles with his faith and has incredible self doubt even though he's doing all he can to help those around him
or <unk> who dreams of being a sword fighter but his weak constitution won't allow him to become one and so he helps in the ways he can but his whole story is one of <unk> dreams
and that's it those are the only two interesting characters in fire emblem until we get to raphael my sweet bulky boy who only cares about eating and training and not about studying
the thing is the fire emblem world has moved past <unk> and <unk> welcome to the age of <unk> there
forty-five <unk> to help you differentiate the five hundred and <unk> fire emblem characters
if you're a gosh dang rocket scientist forty-five is still too much we can combine these we'll take these six and combine them to create a new <unk> that is as important as it is bland
these three can be more <unk> summarized in a category called holy shit why are you a soldier let's just go ahead and <unk> off all of the <unk> and now we can take these straight talking suck ups and call them teacher's pets
<unk> these three <unk> all have tough <unk> to break through these three <unk> really explore familial bonds which is a rare condition in this day whether it's a good or bad reaction doesn't matter to this group they just want to be seen
they're just too nice for all this these four <unk> will always be <unk> expectations it's fairly surprising that these three <unk> were let in chill dudes gambling a bunch of <unk> damn if these aren't fun to hang out with
all three of these are going to time out cause they need to calm it down and there we go the thirteen <unk> that make it possible to differentiate the fire emblem characters just thirteen of them that is fewer than the <unk> <unk>
it's only thirteen
which is not only an unlucky number but it is too large for your tiny child brains we can make it better we can combine more we can perfect this granted it's a little bit harder to combine these <unk> but just off the bat
we can take look at me baby and making waves and just combine it into one thing <unk> and the necessary but boring and the <unk> and the teacher's pets and the calm it downs they all fill me with a sense of <unk>
and obviously the ah too nice for this and the lied on your resume and the holy shit why are you a soldiers ah are all just a bad choice for a war
and that just leaves us with the characters that are hard to break the ice with and ah the ones that got family issues and the quiet ones and the ones that are fun to hang out with
ah and that just sounds like a pretty <unk> awkward family reunion and when you think about it these ones are just strange characters that have ah that are good at fighting i mean if you include <unk> in this he has an eye patch okay
which is similar to these ones <unk> and <unk> have the they rhyme ah we also i mean dorothea wears a hat until she grows out of the hat think about that don't even get me started on <unk>
i don't know who that is is it pronounced dice or <unk> and we can have a category called anime character with a singular personality trait and a <unk> for violence and that's just the one category
which proves that the fire emblem characters are all essentially the same and that you cannot differentiate them mission complete
what was this unraveled about again
<unk> the servant clown sometimes to two masters
now italian
ah that guy is
ah that dudes wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch weird patches it must be <unk> the servant clown sometimes to two masters okay
ah i don't know okay we don't have to use it but we need to record it
the polls have closed in three more states at seven thirty in the east at this point bill clinton has <unk> electoral votes bob <unk> nothing yet
c n n coverage of election <unk> live from c n n center here are judy <unk> bernard shaw bill schneider and ken <unk>
and the biggest electoral prize at this half hour we can tell you is the state of ohio c n n calls that the state of ohio has been won by president clinton this is a big victory ken <unk> for the democrats
that is true no republican has ever been elected without carrying ohio and it's also further bad news because for the last thirty years the state has voted for the win candidate
c n n declares that bill clinton has won west <unk> five electoral votes
not a big surprise the west <unk> is reliably democratic every congressman senator the governors both houses of the state legislature controlled by the democrats
polls have also just closed in the state of north carolina but at this hour it is undecided among the three gentlemen you see there on the screen
judy this is fairly typical for north carolina this is a generally republican state in presidential races but george bush won this state by less than one percent last time he's very closest state
these next two are going to surprise if not shock you first in indiana c n n says that this one is too close to call and in kentucky again eight electoral votes in kentucky too close to call
and look at the percentage of reports
here are three states where the polls closed half an hour ago as yet undecided georgia the peach state
virginia the old dominion still undecided
and south carolina in the presidential contest undecided
now let's move over to the electoral map to show you what we have so far president clinton leading bob <unk> <unk> electoral votes the magic number is two seventy
oh <unk> the story of this
ohio and this half hour florida before that those are two big states and both in the clinton column
and if you look at all the states that we have just said are too close to call among all those states the only one i think if i wrote them down as fast as i could the only one that a democrat carried last time was georgia virginia kentucky indiana and they were all republican state
so if we have these the republicans are in a little bit of difficulty here mister <unk>
but well kentucky and indiana is fascinating they're just fascinating and and and the word was that if if <unk> started out in trouble in kentucky and indiana if he lost them out rightly then i will be out of words
stop we shouldn't say that he hasn't failed we don't know
in june he said if bob <unk> this he calls himself bob <unk> he says if bob <unk> doesn't win kentucky bob <unk> can't win the presidency but we don't know yet but it's tight when
it's right let's take a look now at the states we know ah one or the other has won and here it is for president clinton florida even hearing this in new hampshire ohio vermont and west virginia
and that is up to the what is it <unk> we just count
well
bill schneider you wanna take take over with your exit polls here and and i will say the thought i had
okay we're gonna take a look at the state of ohio a big win for bill clinton isn't it how did he do it well one third of the voters in ohio were union members in the household
they clearly win a majority a solid majority for bill clinton that big a f l c i o push for the democrats for the democratic president paid off in ohio
now let's look at the voters who decided how they will gonna vote just in the last three days how did they end up voting well they voted for bob <unk> it looks like <unk> talk about his momentum in the last few days
it was there those late <unk> decided for him but they were only nine percent of the voters in ohio what about the voters who decided before october who knew exactly how they were gonna vote all along
they were the ones who delivered for bill clinton and that was seventy percent of the voters in ohio so while don't pick up some late momentum
if couldn't compete with a tremendous number of voters seventy percent who knew that who i was going to vote before the month even started out
you are very good with that john man now i'd be jealous tonight well
checking the watch it's time for <unk> here they come
live from washington <unk> on the left geraldine ferraro on the right robert <unk> in the <unk>
republican senator john mccain of arizona adviser to the <unk> camp campaign and in new orleans democratic senator john <unk>
good evening welcome to the <unk> finally election day came when bill clinton casting his vote in the renovated train station in little rock arkansas and bob <unk> voting at the first christian church in russell kansas
the other millions of americans voting today decide of thirty-five senate contests and four hundred and thirty-five house races as well as the presidency president clinton is heavily favored for a second term
and the big question is who controls congress were the republicans narrowly favored jerry
let's pick up on a little bit on this
talking about we've had ohio that is gone for clinton we have kentucky which still so it was a must win so stay too close to call
you see that that um um ah florida has gone to um ah president clinton if if <unk> is in trouble in the south do you see any scenario by which he could win this presidency tonight
well jerry as as i mentioned before when i i just came off of that <unk> hour ah trip ah we centered all we saw enthusiasm every place we went i think that california is still in play
i think that ah there's a lot of southern states that ah went for ah president clinton last time and i certainly think that ah even though they may be ah called undecided i still believe kentucky and indiana for example will go
for ah senator <unk> but i i i don't ah discount the importance of florida and ohio they're important states
so that so that with all things being equal if if this trend continues senator <unk> will stay in washington or go back to kansas but not be president of united states
well ah you you know we've just got a few states and i'd like to to see what happens in some of the other bigger midwestern states and also ah in the southwest as well as the south
if you take a look at the the senate races in lot of the states too new hampshire has gone to a democrat ah there are other states where the seats too close to call and it's there are only a limited number of seats that democrats need to take it over
what is your feeling on this you've been looking at the numbers all along
my feeling is that we pick up like one seat and i'm sure that john <unk> may have a different ah view but ah i think we'd pick up the four southern open democratic seats
and ah the other ones really just start are too close to call like oregon and colorado and um maine is a very close race so georgia yeah so and arkansas is close so i think that ah it's we may be up very late tonight
senator john <unk> ah this is a very good news for president clinton but i wonder if you're popping champagne <unk> yet
because all the early indications are that ah you're not going to control the congress not going to control the senate or the house
so this is a kind of ah of a dutch mare generally dutch mare its means it's ah ah ah a little bit of ah of ah sorrow and a little bit of happiness isn't it
um bob it must be struggling this is devastating news for senator <unk> in a sense when you don't not carry ohio of which every republican president has always carried and you lose florida that's very bad news for senator <unk>
as for as winning an electoral victory and we're not finished voting here in louisiana we got about an hour and a half left and i'm very confident that mary <unk> will be victorious
i think i would agree with <unk> john <unk> my friend that the <unk> gonna be very close i would not be surprised if it was <unk> <unk> either way
well can you can you explain to me how ah by the way of course that winning ohio and and florida do not come under the category of huge surprises everybody thought that the president was going to win those states
but i i i just would like to address my my initial questions senator on on how you can square the ah apparent big victory of president clinton
with the ah with the with the ah uphill struggle i think you have to win the house and senate and let me just ah give a suggestion of what's wrong you're dying in the south isn't that right
ah no not at all i think that we're gonna do well in georgia i think we're gonna win i think we're gonna win in in louisiana we're gonna win in arkansas but i think the basic answer of the question bob is very simple and that is that people vote for their senator
or because of what he says or what she says in their respective states and it's not that connected to the presidential election i think you could have people voting for president clinton and perhaps voting for a republican senator
but we feel very confident in the south we got good moderate candidates despite an onslaught of this liberal liberal liberal charged with people who are very moderate to middle of a lot candidates that we have
well isn't it true that the problem is that some of your candidates in the south like mary <unk> in louisiana and max <unk> in georgia ah were election in your moderates they've been liberals all their life and perhaps the voters saw through them
bob it's really interesting ah they charging mary <unk> being a liberal here's a person who supports the death penalty supports carrying concealed weapons in louisiana and also will support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget that doesn't sound very liberal too
she also
that's what she's been charged with
she also oppose the ah the the bill to ban ah ah the late term abortions
absolutely
ah there you go again following the some of the republican rhetoric she clearly has said that she would have voted just like me and benny <unk> on that issue but her opponent and others keep saying well that's not a position that's what she said very clearly
we're gonna break right now we're gonna come back and discuss whether or not there is going to be a majority in the house and that's democratic majority or republican majority right after this break
<unk> is brought to you by l c i international a very different long distance phone company and by chrysler and the cab forward to <unk> chrysler what's new in your world
welcome back to <unk> we're talking about election <unk> for senator john mccain republican of arizona and <unk> advisor in new orleans senator john <unk> democrat of louisiana
senator let me just pursue this whole thing about the republican majority in the senate just a little bit further because i a lot of us are worried about what will happen once the democratic majority republican majority comes in republican majority comes in
are you guys gonna go after the clinton administration again for another four years or are you gonna are you gonna get that to some serious work in the senate for a change
um jerry could i mention what we will quote before answer and that is we are pleased to see the closure in the popular vote the you should know many of the polls like a b c you had president clinton by sixteen in the teens
looks like good that that that significant closure which could affect some of these other states but ah but look ah yeah you would agree with me that what has been happening
when this foreign money is really incredible and it isn't being reported by republicans and every major newspaper in america that clearly has to be an investigation that
that's called that's called going after the president then then yeah we will be going after if we have the majority but i think that ah i mean that i've been around politics for a long time the three of us i've never seen anything like this i've never seen
we just saw on the front page in your time today mister <unk> had what twelve the visit today
their way senator to go way up to go at one of the sensitive investigations lasted a month or two months or whatever necessary to get the work done or to have one that goes on for years
like this whole white water situation has gone on for years with senator
can we expect that to come up again
well what i hope is that we have ah howard baker on the democrat side as they did during watergate a bipartisan democrat will say look we've got to look into this we've got to go out and then
i hope so
i'll i'll take up on that ah john <unk> are you ready to play the role of howard baker and as bill clinton what did he know and when did he know about this ah <unk> money from indonesia
bob the problem is bipartisan as a bipartisan problem just yesterday ah one person who was a supporter and work for the <unk> campaign confessed to make a a hundred and twenty thousand dollar illegal contribution
i think the american people want us to to look at some new campaign finance reform john mccain i think he's a leader on this issue or with law without democratic side that's what i think the people want they want to make sure we do it right in the future
been a great deal of time
or just <unk> on what has happened in the past because it's been both sides and both sides have to clean up our act
well well john is a realistic louisiana politician you're one of the best of them ah will you would you agree with me that a lot is at stake tonight for the president
on who controls the congressional machinery of of the house and the senate as to what kind of investigation there's going to be
well
hello and welcome to animal watch and this week we're talking the turkish <unk> dog
there are a few breeds in the world who are known as formidable flock guardians
one being the feared and immense <unk>
claimed to have the size strength and ferocity to kill wolves in order to protect their flock
claimed to have the speed and launch power of a <unk>
and suggested to have a bite force that is the most powerful out of every dog breed there is
possessing an old and ancient history that goes back thousands of years
some stories even suggest that actual wolf blood runs through their veins
but what is the truth are these huge <unk> dogs mindless killers or simply <unk> of the innocent
are they suitable as pets or best left as working dogs
and can they really kill a wolf or are they simply effective wolf <unk>
today i'm visiting carl <unk> in the u k who is guardian of several <unk>
and also one of the u <unk> top <unk> experts sheila reed in order to find out just what the temperament is
of one of these incredible looking dogs and also the truth
hi carl
hi <unk>
nice to meet you
these are these my <unk>
wow look at him hello
this is this is dave here
dave
yes this is dave
what a tough name for a <unk> i love it
it's amazing
it's brilliant oh he's beautiful isn't he and this is
ah this is dave and <unk>
<unk> that's a pretty name
i met <unk> two <unk> and the first thing that hit me was how lovely they were really affectionate and welcoming of strangers
dave his male <unk> just wanted to be petted and loved to roll over and fall down in my lap
the two dogs had an obvious roving curiosity and carl mentioned that he preferred to keep them <unk>
as their protective streak would kick in like a <unk> from zero to eighty miles per hour if a passing dog went by in the distance
even though they had just been introduced to this field apparently it would now have become their territory to protect and keep safe
well carl these are beautiful beautiful dogs this is the first time i've ever met a <unk> dog you get this sort of idea when people go on about them being
you know sort of these ferocious flock guardians and that they're going to be somewhat unfriendly but they are so sweet and lovely
they they are with with people and families and especially children
um you know a a a good <unk> is completely solid temperament basically calm until roused
um they they can be confrontational if they consider that there's something um outside of what they perceive to be their flock
their family their garden their area um if anything kind of threatens that then they yes they do come alive
it's very very well documented that they are exceptional with children literally because for for centuries they've had to grow up in villages
yes
um with children running around and they can't show any undue aggression otherwise they they would be fiercely treated
how tall do the <unk> stand
um there's again there's quite a disparity with what you think is um is is is a massive <unk> versus what is the reality of a <unk>
i i i believe um if you if you do any googling or if you look at youtube or pictures
or wherever you you sometimes see massive dogs generally originating out of turkey um the the that are coming in at you know eighty ninety hundred kilos
um these these are just these are just not <unk> they're not they're not a working dog they couldn't do a day's work
these are more of the proper working <unk> that are out there with the shepherds
there's there is big there is small within a standard um yeah anywhere between <unk> and thirty-two approximately
how heavy are the <unk> approximately
oh ah anywhere between about ninety and a hundred and thirty pounds
let's just quickly talk about um <unk> ears here because i know people comment a lot about cropped ears
in the united kingdom we don't crop ears it's illegal um he's an import and of course when they come in from working lines they've been cropped
when they've been very very young and of course little dave here is an is an import so um he's he's not being cropped here in the u k
and carl certainly doesn't crop any of the ears and of course as you can see here on the female this is what their ears are supposed to look like
so what is it like having a <unk> in your house
for such big dogs ah you sometimes you you can't hear them you don't know where they are and yet they know
they they constantly watch um they're pretty much sleep with one eye open so they'll know exactly what's happening anything out of the unusual then they'll they'll let you know
yes so if somebody rings the <unk> will they fly up
yeah they yeah they yeah they want to know what it is
how about if somebody is walking a dog past your window
yeah then then they will yes they will go mental they will go mental
if i came to greet you in your house would they still treat me exactly
exactly the same
so just lovely dogs actually really really lovely dogs that have got a bit of a rubbish reputation i've got to say on some of the clips i've been seeing
what is the life expectancy for a <unk> because they're quite large dogs but they're healthy
yes they are they are very very healthy there's normally fair to say that the bigger the dog the less long they live yeah ah
but that is quite unusual with these because i've known dogs um ah the of fourteen fifteen sixteen years old
really good age that's good age healthy age
they live and work for a very long time
it's an unbelievable coat i mean if i rub my hand up here it's dense the the under hello dave
so sweet
it's so thick and dense isn't it and like the <unk> is the same length as the guard hairs isn't it
and we can see how they can keep so warm up in the mountains i mean how cold does it get in turkey
in the winters it's got to be minus thirty
minus thirty yeah and of course they crop the ears out there because they can get <unk> and one of the first things to go is the ears um
as well of course if they come into a confrontation with a wolf a wolf will latch on to anything that's hanging off so like the ears this is the only color they come in then i presume
what what color is this called
it's it's <unk> with a black mask
and it's a very similar color to <unk> isn't it that's why you said they sometimes get muddled up
yeah there's that and and of course they have have a similar <unk> tail
they're not <unk> they're not <unk> or clumsy or or anything like that they're just very they're just very calm
you could have quite a very small child with them and they're not going to jump on them or scratch them they seem very very very relaxed to me these dogs are very very aloof
and they're very independent if you let them off the lead and they see something you were saying they could just literally go
yeah they they will always on a leash you've got to be a quite a brave person to let your <unk> run loose
it might be fair to say that if you get recall from your <unk> you'll go down in history
when they go it's gosh and they pull they really pull
they have greater strength than what they seem to be in size
you got to be fairly young and agile and fit and strong to have one of these dogs
a fenced garden
a fenced garden because you're saying your boy here is a jumper so yeah
they're also very very good <unk> they're very very good <unk> ah they will dig under fences um to to get out
the i think the digging comes back from um in in summer time
in summer time they'll they'll they'll they'll dig they'll dig for they'll dig for a cool a cool shade cool area
and then in the winter time they go down in the snow seems exactly like a wolf will do that too what do they eat
ah what do they eat um the ah mine mine eat ah fresh meat fresh meat and biscuits ah or <unk> or or anything
that they i've got for them they survive on very little actually it's not true to say that you know they're big dogs and you've got to feed them two three four pounds of meat a day
no they survive they survive on quite small amount of food
maybe that's because of their breeding and their you know having to be up in the mountains
later that week i dropped by to meet a very special lady indeed sheila reed respected across the u k for her expertise in the <unk> breed
both her and her husband michael had kept <unk> for decades now and had traveled out to turkey many times to source dogs from working lines
if there was anyone who knew the <unk> better then it would be her
we fell in love with the breed
our old dog had died and we just wanted we wanted a natural dog we went to see a lady called mrs betty marshall
and she bought our her dog called <unk> he stood on his back legs and he put his paws on my shoulders
and he looked me in the eye
and he looked right into my soul
and that was it
the turkish people will tell you that they came with them as they moved up through into turkey they've been used for thousands and thousands of years the turkish people will tell you that they came with them as they moved up through into turkey they've been used for thousands and thousands of years
and it is their role to protect whatever it is that they live with that's what they do naturally
if you go into turkey and you go into the villages you'll see the old dogs and if they're no longer fit
you know and and young out with the flock they actually can't stay in the villages and when the children start to wander off
you'll actually see the old dogs go ah and heave themselves to their feet but they will go off with the children
to ensure that the children are never alone and they are their guardian so they don't march up and down being aggressive
they just wander quietly along making sure the children are safe certainly um the the the <unk> dog could kill a wolf without any problem at all
if you watch the <unk> dogs when when they're young puppies their mother teaches them in play and they will use their shoulders to charge
they don't always win we had a very very sad story we went out on a um vaccination program in two thousand and three i think it was
one day we went up to the top of the mountain to this village first and there were only three puppies
and that was because previous week there was a big big um pack of wolves had come into the village in in the middle of the night
and the males had gone out and what would happen is they'd gone into attack mode with the with the wolves
the wolves basically were winning
so the people of the village got their burning <unk> and and go out but the mother of these puppies but been in a shed with the puppies
when she could hear that that things were going badly because it is usually the bitch that kills the wolves not the males she'd broken free
and left the puppies locked in in a safe place and gone out so between her and the villagers the wolves were chased away
but all of the males were dead but she was severely damaged they do take enormous care of the dogs
and they worked very hard on her but unfortunately she didn't survive and all they've got left were these three puppies and the villagers were absolutely heartbroken
but the turks don't recognize any dog called an <unk> shepherd dog
to them the word <unk> shepherd they don't accept the word <unk> because that's just that a plateau in in turkey it's a it's a nothingness
it was a word that was taken up by the americans to to give it a a name
and basically it's it's a word that covers any big dog that comes from turkey any dog over twenty-four inches that comes out of turkey
so it could be any colour any coat length anything really whereas the <unk> dog is a particular type
if you look at an <unk> shepherd dog some of them look like <unk> dogs because a lot of them might have in their background a grandfather or grandmother
they're not a dog for somebody who wants a dog that they can wander down the road and go to the local park and let them off fully to play with all the other dogs
they'd be fine when they were puppies but what would be happening is gradually that park would become theirs if they went there every day or once a week gradually as they grew up
that would be their park and so they would consider that everybody within that park were people who needed to abide by certain behavior
pans civilized behavior pans if some stupid dog comes up to it growling and snapping and snarling and biting at his face
a <unk> dog will just
do dog behavior and he will stand completely <unk> which is dog language for your behavior is unacceptable please stop
but if that doesn't work he will follow through
in animal behaviour patterns
until it gets to the point where he has to do what animal behavior insists that he must do which is to pick it up and give it a good thumping
which is not acceptable in today's modern world in today's modern world that will make him a dangerous dog which he doesn't understand
because as far as he's concerned he's he's followed all the patterns you know i've tried and i've been very civilized i've said
don't do that i've said i told you not to do that you know i've followed all the behavior lines
it isn't just physical strength you need them to know what you want them to do
when we had our first dogs they knew that i didn't want them to behave in a certain way at a certain place what they did know was
they had somewhere where they could do that always our dogs have had somewhere where they could guard
our dogs here we've got a <unk> they guard they got they run up and down and they shout and they scream if anybody goes by that's what they do
when we go out from here they know that that behavior is not acceptable
we do not have a dog barking and growling and screaming in a car and we make that clear from an early age
they're not a dog that goes around with their sleeves rolled up looking for trouble and they should not be like that and that is not what somebody should be wanting
they are not aggressive what they are is they are there to take care of you
they are my heart and soul and they will give you their heart and their soul they don't hold back ever there's there's no half ways they're an all or nothing dog
and that's the trouble with me i'm an all or nothing person
and that's what i like about them
i was deeply moved by <unk> stories and found out information i did not previously know such as there being varying types of <unk>
some large some more <unk> some with more toes and some far more aggressive than others
what was clear though was her deep <unk> love and respect of this breed a breed that she was keen to not have misrepresented
a breed that would love and look after you with its soul and one that she wanted to be embraced by the world
she backed up my conclusion that a wolf can kill a <unk> but equally if the conditions were right a <unk> could kill a wolf
the wolves of turkey and the surrounding areas are much smaller than north american timber wolves and this small size would equate for why they are killed from time to time
but equally it was clear that wolves regularly killed the <unk> however what was most important was the dog's role
as if more flock guardians were use the world around
then there would be less licensed wolf <unk> as farmers could then protect their sheep in the fair and natural way
allowing wolves to <unk> in the lands they all once roamed before industrial farming
sheila also nicely cleared up the <unk> versus <unk> shepherd debate and explained why these two dog breeds are certainly not the same

w w w dot <unk> <unk> dot co dot u k
thank you for joining us i'm spencer <unk>
and i'm <unk> <unk>
and this is the <unk> sports insider we are your ticket to highlights and behind the scenes
all your teams are down to <unk> as well as some of your favorite sport team in d c baltimore and <unk>
we are exclusive any viewers <unk> and former players because we want to engage you
the viewer tell us what games and teams you wanna hear about in upcoming episode
that's right we wanna be a part a your team and we want you to be part of ours <unk> sports insider starts now
in this reception we headed to <unk> and checked it on a while
very first <unk>
and i wouldn't be surprised brave coach john <unk> had his own fantasy football draft regular season is right around the corner we'll let you know our picks
and we'll head down the snow hill and get our first look at this year's eagles team as they took on north <unk>
we begin today with a team right here in <unk> has some high expectation saying the football season
queen <unk> now they held their first <unk> this year on friday against saint mary's <unk> now the lions finished last year with an eight to three record overall
before eventually being bounced in the state tournament in the first round now they did lose a few guys in that team but they bring back a lot of key players and it's not just what about they're gonna do here early on
but it's about putting in the work they will pay off towards to the end of the year
it's it's definitely a pro a working progress really um most of lion's gonna be really young we're gonna be a bunch of pretty much saw as genius
so just pretty much getting their confidence up and then everything will kind of mesh together after that
spencer you know the lions are one of the teams that every other teams in the <unk> ice north division actually circles on their calendar so they mean business
but like this q b said this is a young team and they have to find their comfort level and their <unk> on friday the lions had some mistakes on both sides of the ball
the program itself has not a one a regional championship in a couple years and for this team to get back to the top of the football chain
they need to feel comfortable especially since they have some new faces the lions have the athletic ability but we know football it's not just about athletic ability spencer it's all about the mental game as well
i think you're right too i mean you look at they did have a couple mistakes early on but i actually liked what i saw this team the fact is you're gonna have that early in the first <unk> though while though there work through that get yourself better
and what i really was impressed was bradley how calm and composed he was throughout that interview throughout the game
if you can get that from your senior leadership especially when it's on quarterback you know you're gonna have a pretty good chance to win a ball game especially in the high school games
so i think they actually have a pretty good thing to move forward
he's been there four years with the team
all right it was a <unk> saturday in delaware <unk> central knights played host to the <unk> <unk> raiders and the stephen <unk> <unk>
the knights were doing this all day controlling the game at the line of <unk> that's the quarterback running down and really having their way with the other teams
and the <unk> had questions on who would be the number one running back but they got a few contributions from a few guys and look at that guy just go committee and now the <unk> showed their ability to make the big play especially this guy
i think it was a quarterback <unk> especially for the raiders
that would
this group was actually i worked super hard in camp we have we've tightened the bolts down a little bit of camp from last year and previous years
and ah ah push the kids pretty hard this year i can tell they responded we have a good numbers out and the kids we work hard
and ah you can see it in the play
now these are always good any of those three teams <unk> or for teams the opportunity to really gauge each other against it ah you know some good competition and i think that really stood out for me was why i mean we went to their first goal practices and there was a lot of questions as to what running back who's gonna take over for them moving forward
and the thing is it looks like they have multiple guys that can do it i mean they had a couple guys out there that were really running the ball pretty hard
and the fact is ah ah i mean steven <unk> that is they had guys that they were handing the ball off you were running hard downhill and they also had a guy that was about two hundred and fifty pounds and he was laying guys out i mean he was picking up yards you want about falling forward to get the first down
he was definitely getting that done out that room <unk> and i feel like moving forward they got a good thing going there it's always nice when you have a couple of guys who can hit the ball too
and i think in with any team you know and the whether it was the <unk> the raiders or the knights the best part about <unk> just be able to finally play against someone else
and i know this <unk> help each team get a good measure on how their offense and defense will really perform and no matter who's on the field it's all about who is gonna be stepped up under pressure and make the big plays whether it's a <unk> or the first game of the season
and as coach <unk> said the cream usually comes to the top
and see for day hosted a four team <unk> which included <unk> james bennett and colonel richardson now a strong play for ball teams at this thing
and speak in a strong place check out this run here by t j <unk> i mean just knocking guys out of his way <unk> downhill colonel richardson was moving the ball as well and this thing their quarterback <unk> here in the middle of the crease in
making a lot of guys miss he's gonna be got to watch this year parks on the other hand they were getting it done through the air air in this one out way downhill devin <unk> <unk> that beautiful catch their completion
<unk> they got it done on defense i think that's gonna be one area where they improved a lot this year made a couple <unk> and it was good to see out of them
well we were ready we were <unk> for it and we all came in with the right intensity so we knew this was the first chance we got to actually put full pads on a play against somebody else so we were ready for it
i think it was it went very well for us um still things improve on but coming out today and seeing what we had we did a great job out here by executed well
you know <unk> actually being out there on saturday felt like each team was actually playing for a championship one team that stood out from the rest of them where the <unk> i mean their running game was on point finding the holes <unk> defenders they could do no wrong in my eyes
on the other hand what other teams that made some mistakes on both sides of the ball would wear the blue jays i spoke to coach darling he said his team is too selfish right now and is trying to get them to be a more cohesive unit and you know the <unk> is actually gonna help them get to that better direction
absolutely it's always tough to that's first year the program's moving forward you kind of need to get the senior leadership <unk> stabbed yourself so i'm sure we'll be fine down the stretch but early on it's always up to go but i think that really impressed me was <unk> i mean they had some guys down the field that were definitely making some plays of the ball
that passing game looks legit and they have a couple guys do that i feel like you're gonna watch out for this year and at the high school level i was a little concerned that they wouldn't be able to have the <unk> in the time to get it out there
but they found them in space and they can do that throughout the year i mean this is guaranteed you're definitely gonna watch them move forward as they were quality quality program
well how do you feel about it we wanna know so reach out to us on facebook or twitter send us a message there
or email us at <unk> a b c dot com or you can mail at um sports at w m d t dot com that is let us know what games you wanna go to and also check out our polls online
and don't you just love football so much of it and we're not done yet right after the break the <unk> <unk> taking on the tribe <unk> keep locked right here
hey dude i'm matt griffith from <unk> high school head varsity football coach you're watching the <unk> sports insider
welcome back well we are still talking some football until you got a special special segment for this one
we are our own train miles who's a why high alum had a chance to talk to his old coach about the program's direction <unk> were you tempted to put on some gear and do you miss it
well i don't exactly miss the two a day practices or the <unk> set of that locker room but of course i do miss the game
so i stopped by practice and chatted with my former j v coach now varsity head coach pat <unk> to see exactly what while high need to improve upon to return to the base our dominance
i got my jersey on right now it's been seven years can you believe that <unk> legend
yeah i can't believe it indeed feels like yesterday
three and seven was kind of down year last year according to program standards or what what what will change that this year
ah ah the biggest difference between last year and this year is gonna be team unity ah we stressed in the weight room all see off all off season ah as soon as the season was over i realized a lot of the mistakes that i made as a head football coach
um you know i'm gonna put a lot of blame on myself it is it is on my shoulders and i felt like our team wasn't together they are more about playing for themselves we had great athletes last year
ah and we just didn't come together and and play together
my man nelson brown will be featured in this office talk about him and why he <unk> at what he does
ah nelson brown just one of those phenomenal athletes ah he he's not an athlete you that comes around all the time and <unk> being looked at by division one double a football schools
um wait ah he's a scholarship kid and we're waiting on that first scholarship ah morgan states been really looking hard at him but you know beside that he is just he goes out there is the ultra competitor
and he doesn't like being on the <unk> whether it's in practice or on ah during a game so in a game he's gonna we're looking at him really carrying a load this year and really being the running back that he can be
you talked about a newcomer that you're expecting to really expect him to ah put some things on tape really have a good ah time for you this year
ah i i got would say the the new <unk> that i'm looking forward to the most is <unk> <unk> he's just at every single thing that we could offer he he goes to the <unk> training the weight room the beach
wherever we are doing training he is there
i got a new guy ah here at corner <unk> <unk> who ah we saw him at the ben tate camp ah honestly in my eyes he was the best corner there talk about him and what what does this young defense will bring to the table
yeah our our d backs this year are pretty much all new like you said <unk> is one of those guys is gonna try to shut you down the line of <unk>
he's very strong he's little but he's very strong and is very fast and you know we're really excited about all of them
well saturday <unk> made the trip to <unk> country to take on six time state champion <unk> and a little <unk> football action
there's a man nelson brown he was out ah on saturday with a shoulder bruise just <unk> he told me he expects to practice on monday there's another star <unk> leather barry and he is a veteran a natural born leader of the <unk> i expect those young guys there to look for him
we know he's
but check out what he does on defense
this the <unk> out there he's out on the island by himself and this guy will be a natural born leader one thing i really liked about <unk> was their defensive line that reduced the red savage breaking through and dropping leather barry for the sack
i'm telling him in <unk> or two studs on the defensive line this play right here by this young man <unk> <unk> is just a fabulous play look at them take it down through the middle and get those defenders out of his way that's just a filthy move excuse me thank you for a touchdown
this kid gonna be a star not to be <unk> <unk> junior nelson brown takes the <unk> straight up the middle sixty yards out and he didn't even get touched folks he got some <unk> he had a great <unk> as well
and for <unk> coach dave <unk> he knows that the <unk> is all about figuring his team out
the the first week you're hoping just to keep everybody healthy and at first <unk> after we did today and to make sure that we've learned something but if if if you haven't got players that are or what you thought especially the new guys the ones you're talking about
then you may have to make adjustments or you than you can figure out what do they need and so then we will we will make adjustments ourselves because we're not just gonna plug along if we're struggling a particular area will try to make some ah make some modifications
well if you know anything about <unk> football you know <unk> will have that team ready whether he has all freshmen are all seniors there's one there's a reason why he's a <unk> state champion there
still to come the raiders of <unk> on the field for some filed hockey will tell you what they're going to improve upon that nine in six record from just a year ago don't go anywhere
my name's david wells inside <unk> for james m bennett and you're watching demo or sports insider
welcome back for the ah fall sports season it is officially underway and that means just one thing to sell it is time for some filed hockey i mean <unk> they got their first taste of the <unk> action on wednesday when they hosted a five team <unk>
head coach <unk> team will be trying to make the state tournament after coming up just one game short a year ago finishing with a nine in six record that right there sara davis putting on the moves from way outside and scoring it just a beautiful goal
and then just a few minutes later the raiders they are right back at it they found the net one more time this one was from brady <unk> with the honors with a beautiful slap shot
our goal is to get into the tournament i get really hard into the tournament and i don't know we've been talking about it for a few years so i'm just really excited it's really important to me
set those expectations
yeah definitely when you are raised up there and the fact is i look to this team and i we went in i was talk with coach really edwards they had they knew they're gonna be able to score the ball and they knew they had a good opportunity of being a very high scoring team but they didn't realize how good they're gonna be <unk> and they definitely showed that in the <unk>
i feel like they're gonna be a quality program but what scares me the fact they only have three seniors and they're gonna be relying on a lot of unproven teams that doesn't mean that they can't do it but the fact is those guys haven't had the minutes yet they haven't proven they can play this level so there's still some question marks moving forward
i mean you are right having only three seniors is a little worrisome but sometimes you have to look past that number and see the group as a whole and you know growing pains are actually normal in high school and this team looks ready to step it up to the next level
like the coach said it's about avoiding mistakes and learning from each game which is key in any sport
yeah absolutely by the way congratulations to coach <unk> she actually just got married a couple weeks ago
and the volleyball season well that's here as well several teams were taking part in their first <unk> of the year on thursday snow hill welcome north <unk> to the town the snow hill eagles will have some high expectations coming in this year
and as for <unk> as well it's a success even having a team on the court i mean the eagles isn't the first time they've had a program reopening up this year now over although both teams were pretty pleased with what they saw from their team
really returned to work on the fundamentals basics again drawn improves from serving some net play and really try to put together an offense that's gonna be a little bit more aggressive than we were last year
we've got fifteen girls out here we kind of tried to go with our most athletic girls and just kind of work with it from there but they're very excited um coach jackson and i are very excited so it's always cool to have a new program give the kid similar experiences
she is absolutely right then i was thinking about that out what a great experience for these guys i mean they're going into the season they're not gonna have too much pressure i mean no one's really expecting them to make a run as far as wins
but just the fact it'll be a part of a brand new program to get out there on the court and have a great time with your friends and to learn a new sporting be competitive with it i mean this is something they'll be able to say for the rest of lives that they were part of the very first team there
and i really i mean i can't imagine what that feeling must be like
but you should that sounds like guys it's like the beginning we started from the beginning around when i was a part of a water polo team at my high school that was only in its second year thought about patience when you're in a startup program and the eagles will learn so much of that this season
and spencer one of the things they have to also see is being able to build that roster and see who's actually gonna be able to perform well on the court
yes absolutely moving for that'll be a great test of just what this team is gonna have
all right and so many games on the eastern shore and tell us which one we should go to like our facebook page <unk> a b c sports and after you do that go follow us on our twitter account at <unk> a b c sports
and even if it's a selfie or a view at a sporting event send us those two so you might see them in our next show
yeah absolutely and <unk> gonna take another quick commercial break but don't go anywhere we're gonna talk a little fantasy football after the break what players can make or break this year's team will discuss
this is monica <unk> for the <unk> field hockey team and you are watching the <unk> sports insider
welcome back what we're gonna talk a little fantasy football now guys and there's always that one guy's flying under the radar that can totally change your team just tell who you got this year
my sleeper pick is actually someone i went to high school with t y hilton the front of the <unk> a wide receiver and he was as impressive with andrew luck he was impressive as andrew <unk> number one option last season after the injury to <unk> reggie wayne
i mean just look at those stats from last season hilton had one thousand <unk> yards and five <unk> he's speedy and sure wayne is coming back this season but i think hilton will put a big numbers this season
and give me some major points that i need
yeah well my <unk> i did not go to high school with but i'm going with e j manuel manuel missed six games last season with an <unk> knee but he's got some serious weapons now c j <unk> fred jack jackson
ah they traded for up in a draft for sammy <unk> he's a monster the add robert woods and speed the <unk> <unk> early but got mike williams and i mean there's a lot of weapons there a lot of young weapons but the very talented he's <unk> in most leagues you know
so i think you you can make a case to be a good sleeper pick i definitely do you can definitely late in the draft
i think there's a big reason why he was <unk> most leagues i'm sleeping on manuel forward
but the guy i'm going with the <unk> are always hard i think <unk> green is gonna have a big year for these chargers in this year
i mean he didn't exactly have amazing numbers last year i get it he just thirteen catches in three ds but he's starting to take more and more reps with the ones philip rivers loves his tight ends i think he can get a lot of balls thrown his way this year
well you think so
i think so
i know
well have you ever had someone let you down
that's what you needed them let's talk about the bus the worst fantasy football thing that could ever happened as the bus
who are you guys going with today
drum roll i got <unk> i know somebody out there also has rob <unk> as their bus i know this guy has an a c l injury and he's no adrian peterson let's be real the unlucky number here is fourteen and no that's not the number of <unk>
he scored that's the how many weeks of football he's missed due to injury i understand that he's one of the top tight ends in the league when he was extremely healthy remember extremely healthy scoring <unk> <unk> in fifty career regular season games
he's also had eight career surgeries i just don't see the spark in <unk> how much can you really physically overcome the season the game was just getting even harder
i don't know any time you got brady i feel like you're gonna be all right
all right sorry now sorry eagle fans but i'm going with nick <unk> yeah i know what you're saying nick <unk> had amazing numbers last season which is exactly why i'm staying away from teams now have film of them in a prepared for chip kelly's offense
plus he lost the sean jackson he looked lost when i was up there at eagles camp guys but so did all the eagles quarterbacks but i'm not saying don't draft the eagles especially sean mccoy
but i don't think nick ah <unk> is gonna put up half the numbers he put up last year
you just made a lot of people angry here
i definitely wanna stay away from though is eric decker i mean this guy is definitely cause some people from winning their leagues is we're gonna dread on i get it i mean he had some good numbers in denver but the fact is that offense is ridiculous there
and a number that you need to know is that guy dropped thirty percent of his <unk> balls i mean he is not got good and he doesn't have good <unk> speed and i just don't feel like anyone to go near him at all
next week when we bring in chris russell from e s p n nine eighty in d c talk about the redskins and coming up after the break one of our favorite segments crazy catches <unk> and stops our plays of the week coming up you won't wanna miss it

we're in istanbul turkey
the food culture here will blow your mind we're so excited to be filming a bunch of food video
let's get food hunting
istanbul has an exciting and vibrant food scene this city's diverse heritage is reflected in its incredible food culture in this five part series we're going to show you some delicious local turkish food
and eat what the locals eat this is our third video of the series and we're hunting down the popular snack of <unk> eating a <unk> drenched in <unk> butter
and visiting a historic sweet shop for <unk> famous turkish delight you don't want to miss this video get ready for some <unk> food
i'm thomas
and i'm <unk> and we're taking a plate
we hope you're hungry and let's eat
we're starting our food hunting day over on the asian side of istanbul and the first thing we are going to eat is a thing called <unk> so <unk> you'll often see described as turkish pizza but it is nothing alike it
it has its really own unique identity and it is super delicious
so this is <unk> now i reckon it is called turkish pizza because it's round it's made up of dough and the dough has got some topping on it but it is really different in my opinion
it take a small a clump of dough and they roll that dough out until it's really thin <unk> and then they smear it with a thin minced mixture of lamb <unk> i think it's a little bit of chili on there
and then they pop it into a really blazing hot <unk> oven now you can see that the dough is just perfectly <unk> and in it's got that whole minced meat mixture on the top
but it's so thin that you can see like parts of the dough coming through so the way that it's served is it comes with fresh <unk> and some lemon so what you do is you grab some <unk> pop it in the middle
and then give a little bit of squeeze of lemon over the top of it and you take the whole thing and you roll it up so you wouldn't think that the dough is very <unk> but it is
it's like beautifully soft alright let's give this thing a taste
that is so good it is beautiful the dough is so soft but it has the perfect amount of <unk> it's almost a little bit <unk> but in a pleasant way
and the minced meat mixture the lamb it's got so much flavor and there's just enough on there there's the perfect balance of um meat and um dough
this is good my initial bite didn't get any of that <unk> in there so let's go for another one
that fresh <unk> <unk> such a beautiful vibrant flavor and in that tiny squeeze and hint of lemon juice adds an <unk> to that bite oh man this is so good
that was a great start to this food hunting day don't let anyone tell you that dish is like a pizza it's nothing like a pizza stands out on its own for its own reasons and it is incredible we're on to find some more food now
our next stop is taking us down near the coast and how beautiful is this city so i'm going to show you some shots of this beautiful coastline before we start eating again
i'm really excited about our next stop we're gonna be eating a thing called an <unk> <unk> now <unk> is like a common term for meat that's fashioned onto a <unk> and then grilled and this <unk> is made up of a plate of meat
with tomato sauce creamy yogurt and brown butter it looks insane and the restaurant which is just over there
is owned and operated by the family of the man who created this <unk> way back in eighteen <unk> so there's a real history
with this restaurant let's go and eat
our <unk> has just been delivered and this is unreal and it's pretty different to what you expect when you get some form of <unk> here in turkey so normally there's bread around the outside but in this case there's a little bit of bread hiding underneath
but it's all about the meat so all of this lamb is just piled on top and then to go with it a <unk> <unk> of yogurt
some grilled um chili peppers and then some fresh tomato and on top of that meat is <unk> butter so that's gonna just make it super rich and creamy so they bring over the big pan of brown butter
and pour it all over the meat and you can actually see the tomato sauce that <unk> mentioned as well so you can see the slight orange colour in there and then look at the butter just glistening on that meat so
let's just grab some meat get some bread from under there as well a whole lot of yogurt and get right on in
oh wow
wow that is good um
wow the meat is so soft it's not been charred right down so it doesn't have like the crunchy bits you often get with this type of meat it's just really soft
it's quite um salty it's got a beautiful <unk>
that butter it just sort of coats your mouth i was expecting maybe it to be a little bit <unk> a little bit oily on the top of my mouth
not at all it's super rich and juicy i'm gonna get some more but this time i just want a couple of bits of meat so i don't want the yogurt or the bread the yogurt flavour was very strong so the <unk> of the yogurt
i think overtook from the meat flavour a bit
um um oh yeah oh that's good um
oh the butter flavour really really came home that time so it's got quite a sweetness which i guess is coming from that tomato sauce oh this is really good
i'm gonna make up a mouthful here with the <unk> the lamb and also some chili pepper and the bread has gone ah quite soft because of that tomato sauce and the butter and then that yogurt in there
um um that's really good it's very rich from that butter creamy from that <unk> but then you can really taste the flavour of the meat that's delicious i'm also washing it down with um
a drink called ah <unk> and it's a slightly fermented grape juice sweetened grape juice and this is sort of the traditional accompaniment
um cold sweet refreshing a tiny little bit <unk> it's the perfect thing to go with this
look how all that butter is just sitting in the bottom of the plate now so i'm gonna grab some more meat and that really <unk> bread get it right through that butter super oily
um um um now i can really taste the butter in my first bites i could taste the butter but it wasn't a a big flavor that is a super bold flavor
really rich and creamy and it's super oily so there's oils from the meat the tomato sauce and from the butter so you're getting this combination of different <unk> down there
and it works a treat just <unk> into this plate is really really good
now a day in istanbul is complete without a ferry ride or two so now we're catching the ferry from the asian side back over to europe we're going to continue our food hunt
we've made it back to the european side of istanbul and next up we're gonna have an absolute classic snack here in turkey and that is turkish delight now you will see this stuff piled up all over the city in the windows of shops
massive piles of colourful turkish delight but we're not going to one of those places we're gonna go to this really traditional place here that's been around since nineteen <unk> you won't see those vivid colours here from food <unk>
it's all natural and this stuff is really really good let's go grab some
we're loaded up with our bags of turkish delight i wanted to stay in that sweet shop forever it had such a beautiful old world feel about it and the staff were so friendly they had these gorgeous huge candy jars
filled with sweets tonnes of turkish delight and they even had big pots of homemade jam so you can take your own ah jam jars from
fill it up oh it was a beautiful spot we're now going to head off and find ourselves a turkish coffee to wash these babies down
it's a holiday here in istanbul today so the coffee place we wanted to go to is sadly shut it's known as one of the best places to get a turkish coffee here in istanbul so that is why we wanted to go to that particular place
so we've scrapped the coffee idea we're gonna do the next best thing here in turkey and that is tea they have these brilliant little street side <unk> just little mini <unk> right on the <unk> we're gonna grab a tea there
we've sat ourselves down at a small table at this tea cafe ordered up a couple of glasses of ah turkish tea and we are going to crack into this turkish delight
so turkish delight in turkish is <unk> and if you've never had <unk> before it's like a jelly like sweet almost like a <unk> and it's made out of corn flour and water and sugar
and then they dust it with <unk> sugar um once it's cooled and we ordered rose <unk> and mint flavour and we've had this before and we know that it is amazing so i've got the <unk> here
um um it's beautiful the flavour of the <unk> is really strong so a really earthy flavour and the <unk> still have a bit of crunch they're not
soft they're quite crunchy and then the texture of the turkish delight or the <unk> is really sort of um a little bit sticky tiny bit <unk> but very soft and it's very sweet
so this tea is gonna go perfectly with it so they like to serve their tea with sugar the turks so i'm gonna pop the two sugars in because i find that the tea can be quite strong
and quite bitter so we'll just give that a bit of a stir
all right let's have a sip of this <unk> or tea
oh yeah that's really good so it's very strong quite bitter and i don't know if thomas mentioned but drinking tea is like a national pastime in turkey people stop and have a cup of tea like all throughout the day right from the early morning right through
to the ah evening late late at night and both of us have really gotten into this pastime it's really nice to just take a moment out of your day sit watch the world go by sip your tea
and this is a perfect combination you've got the really sweet turkish delight and then the bitter tea to wash it down
all right i am gonna grab a piece of mint turkish delight and this is my favorite flavour for turkish delight by a long way i've got great memories of turkish delight as a young boy eating it because it was a bit of a treat in my family both my parents
and my auntie and uncle came to istanbul in the seventies they got a taste for turkish delight back then so it was always the treat thing we had on our out family's dinner table for after a meal let's try this mint
oh that's delicious oh the flavour just builds you know when it's natural mint flavour because it comes on slowly and like <unk> said we've had this turkish delight before and i know that this mint flavour just
evolves and evolves and even ten minutes later it's still in your mouth incredibly strong that's a beautiful beautiful flavour and i love that it's not bright green like i talked about before
when you see turkish delight in the shops on the main road the tourist strips bright greens bright <unk> for the rose one these are not like that at all they're just very subtly coloured little <unk> of mint in the mint one
and the taste is absolutely incredible so if you're here in istanbul you've definitely got to have a taste of turkish delight and make sure you get it from this place or one of the few places like this one but this place does an incredible version of turkish delight
they're really good
another great day of eating here in istanbul and we're finishing with one of the turkish delight places behind us that i've talked about a couple of times so the colourful stuff piled up on
the <unk> strips so don't go to one of those go to where we did this place is incredible for food though

good evening everybody
hello hello our saturday night live
this is as exciting as it gets
these are two kids this our saturday night so glad you guys can enjoy it with us ah we are gonna have some
some talks tonight ah definitely questions from you guys we are looking to hear some more stories from people what they are doing with their channel about themselves
love to have some more editing questions had a great time last night some really good questions some <unk> of course but i think we did okay through them so
and that helps us learn as well so
a little bit fun chat a little bit technical questions ah whatever your heart feels like it's saturday night so can get a little crazy to
yes yes
don't forget to drop your question in the chat and ah just say hi so we know you're there
definitely well we already have three viewers wow welcome
ah bottle caps welcome
he is my hero here i will stroke this for you since you have good advice today so
maybe you can tell the rest of the audience who is not familiar with why you are doing that
<unk> bottle caps just told me that i should shave my beard and i would look twenty years younger so and i was tom hammond i have a wife who thoroughly enjoys this beard that
i do i do see you can see that
and has
you are already start getting crazy
that's right the parties already started so
so yeah so i appreciated the ah the feedback ah ah my sister actually would side with you well she's always wanted me to get rid of it
i had it most my life i actually a <unk> i recently just shaved i had a full winter beard you as a full canadian understand that for the winter months
but i always had some sort of facial hair except for two years most two or three years i guess when i worked in saskatchewan ah hauling crude oil
because of the ah fire restrictions to be able to wear a mask in case of emergency you're not allowed to have any facial hair except for a moustache so
yes i'm forgetting thanks for reminding me about the about the camera because i am used to having it on my computer and now it's between the both of us
so i always had a clean <unk> face during that time and that was probably one of the more depressing parts of my life i like my job but it just never felt like me
so that's it was one of the first things i did as soon as i stopped working at that we moved back to montreal was to grow my facial hair again i don't think i've ever gone without it since
ah yeah i i've maybe once or twice so i i think
after a <unk> shave job just shave start over again but it was very temporarily
yeah i think so funny <unk> actually before we went to saskatchewan you had long hair
very long hair
long hair and before before that he had very long hair like you can't even see how long it was
that was a different time and place
so yeah he has gone through ah different phases but i love beard i know i i ah
i don't know just something about it i i just like it ah i mean i like it when you shave it off too but ah it's just some that forest cave man anything or not
yeah <unk> does have a thing for cave man in the forest so
viking caveman mix of a thing i guess
yeah and the funny part is we had the viking wedding and i think that's one of the shortest my facial hair and beard and the hair actually ever was
i think so yeah yeah well you have it little bit shave at the sides things like like i i wanted the way he is right now that's that's my favorite
yeah
little bit of a point not devil look i call it just a little bit of an edge to it so
yeah so ah that's a kind a long answer to bottle <unk> ah remark from yesterday
and will do love you bottle caps we always get a kick out of you we're always glad to have you here so
ah bottle caps is saying with that on the west coast we call you a hippie
ah
i don't know i i don't know much about the hippie

i just put up by the <unk> right here just so you can take a quick look at that and this is the highest point actually in europe and you go by train
and the train <unk> up to about three quarters to the the top and from there you switch over to another train <unk> of course
which takes you right to the very top the last part going through is a tunnel through one of the peaks and when you arrive at the top you're at a lookout point that's <unk> feet
it's amazing i was in switzerland and was tired from my trip and almost didn't go and thank you to my lovely wife who ah convince me that i was crazy to be there and not go through with it
it was probably one of the most amazing places i'd ever seen in my life
so that will be the next one that's coming up um i'm probably looking at i don't know maybe monday at this point i guess would be the
well definitely next week
yeah cause i do wanna try to have this one that's gonna to be running on the schedule cause ah when i start having a scheduled p c tweet and we got a ton of photos from places like this
it's a shame that they well not a shame i mean they are being on instagram and places but also did not take advantage youtube as well
here's a couple of photos some of these will be used some not i'll just open this up just to show you this is all taken from the top or on the way ascending
the train is quite let me see i have a picture of the train here i believe and this one
still off the lookout yes here is the train that you actually ah switch over to and this is what takes you to the summit

and brother dun ah if it's too quick for you we can always do another time we love to have you on right now for an impromptu
a lot you guys i mean ah we love the schedule stuff and start bringing on more creators
that's a big big thing right we would love to do
and not just to talk about the platform but to talk about what you're doing what your interests are ah where you started any kind of story you like to talk about
oh man you are testing on my computer knowledge how do you even do that well ah brother dun do you have twitter
yes seven blessings seven blessings i agree with you too that the algorithm does suck on the weekends that's for sure
we checked our analytics right now we're doing best is wednesday and friday right
yeah wednesday thursday friday ah so yeah that's probably be our target days
yeah
for now
yeah exactly
i actually like trying to do their lives dreams in between them as well that's a good day for uploading videos so we'll mix and match them up <unk>
no twitter unfortunately
ah
larry i'm a fisherman too oh we were got lots of fishermen in here
ah brother dun do you have facebook
anything that we can message you at
yeah this is just to send you a link then then all you have to do is click the link and you'll be hooked up <unk> i've been on youtube for four years and now going on five since january
thirteenth to ah fifteenth wow so you definitely been around for a while
ah bottle caps if you watch my last video i made and there's no editing cuts in it
which is better than to hold somebody's attention lots of fast editing
or something ah cuts which is better to hold somebody's attention
lots of fast or something just smooth
okay ah the question into it it really depends on the messages you want to tell
i mean yeah i do i've some very fast editing but i also if you take my sixteen again for a day videos ah a lot of them are where i grew up in the gas bay
ah
they are are not very fast and and they shouldn't cause will absolutely destroy the mood you do a lot of outdoor scenery
and it also depends on your music too what you wanna do ah my last one i did with the european countries i mean they're they're very slow <unk>
but you notice once it get to <unk> it goes chee chee chee and turns the side will that's a white flash i put it and then i rotate i forget maybe twenty-five degrees
but that's just for a transformation to follow with the beat yeah smooth is great lots of people that that's it depends what you want what kind of story you wanna tell
it's amazing how you can take one piece of footage grab ten different tracks of different genres different <unk>
and completely tell a story that would've made ah would've you would've never even guessed of making just by following the beat
and also too it depends on the editor what they're comfortable with i mean i some people it's like guitar players when i was in bands
there are some guys whether the song was ten beats a minute i know that is extreme ah i am just for the point of conversation
or <unk> beats a minute they play the same wiry fast screaming solo over to it
and for me it just didn't make any sense but to them that's just what they wanted to do so
but i find for what you do your type of videos and the type of music you go with smoother is definitely speaks more what you do and they were great
ah dun ah says that he has facebook dun if you can ah just go over to our facebook <unk> studios will that work or
yeah or doesn't matter
<unk> studios and just send us a message saying hi we can replied to you with a link and with the link you just gonna click on to it and you'll be ready to go
there's nothing you have to set up as long as you get a mic and ah camera that's the only thing

we were stuck for a longer time at nine ah well not longest time but for for a while at <unk>
an it just it just wasn't moving so we went on as the guests on two streams and boom
it does happen that quick sometimes
if you're not ah too shy or even if you are that's okay we are shy too even if it does look like that we still are um come on over um
just ah tell us that you're okay with this and ah or tweet a message and i will tweet you the link back
here we go i don't know why on the google maps tonight they have where's <unk> so that is kinda cool but that was that was surprising did you know nothing about this

ah yeah
oh trained man is here as well trained man
hi again thank you
and train man i was telling everybody i don't know if you were here for it last night that we are part of the i am a creator movement

okay so <unk> and heavens we feel wired about putting our own videos on the i am creator <unk>
no you should
put your own and then put somebody else's
ah the best practice i think was two videos yeah
ah two videos in this thing are gonna be good or for catching attention and um letting people know what you're about
put it on its like advertising its free advertising you don't want to be shy advertising you want to be advertising
we're a coop and we're gotta each represent ourselves but also we're hoping each other the same time so it's a win win for everybody
so yeah that's what they were doing they're putting up one or two their own especially if you're just starting there
and then watch a bunch of peoples and you see somebody ah that's not on there yet definitely i want ah couple of theirs like one or two from as many people as possible
yes definitely and you're gotta remember again it's a coop as andrew said it's ah it's for everybody so don't be shy just do it

so a little bit of european and a little bit of canadian based in montreal
that's right a good mix
yeah a great mix
and that yeah exactly
ah shout out to that's how i roll they are ah three away from ah <unk>
oh
anybody haven't subscribed yet please go over that's how i roll
we showed this last night ah just to show you where <unk> is from originally
ah excuse me so this is the map of europe of course and there's <unk> and that's the capital <unk> where ah she ah was raised and
and <unk> the town ah that we named ah our business after
now we laughed last night cause i didn't get it it's tricky to find it's a small little town there is <unk>
and this is this is the town that we named our business after because that's where her mom grew up
roughly forty-five kilometers from the russian border ah beautiful place i absolutely adore it there
um let's see if i can find
kinda tricky to show pictures i got it last night for the road but its very white on my screen cause of the light so i might not be able to see it
but we'll give it a try anyways ah look here we'll just do one on the road here
now i got that in my way so i'm have to bring this up a little bit bear with me
close this and oh my youtube advertisements are getting in the way and that's okay
just
that's a bit of the scenery and its gorgeous over there we do still have some property over there
ah in just up this road we can go for a little walk drive youtube ah google drive you want to call it that
as you can see it reminds me a lot of some of the people here that are from canada may be familiar it reminds me a bit of new brunswick except it's mostly pine trees instead of spruce
but a lot of the same kind of rolling rolling hills had not um very <unk>
that there's only one mountain and that's literally three hundred meters high
but till an amazing amazingly beautiful place ah i think i found it
ah go in
over here
and this is the her mom's family home and right over here this is the new house they're building in front actually but it was right at the spot
so yeah no ah it's a beautiful place ah not a lot of travelers i kinda stand out when i'm there
<unk> and a very very hard language to speak there is only <unk> people around the world i believe or <unk> that speak it
yeah
it is considered an endangered language i was learning russian because of course as an <unk> country you can get by with russian in most places
there is from the side and here is where the <unk> is that i always like to see when we go to the <unk> nest
so which is cool because almost every house does have a nest and the thing is like the size of a forty-five gallon drum
ah the we actually stay in the new house when we were visiting the last time and a <unk> landed on the roof and they're all excited so that's a sign of good luck
<unk> it means that ah whoever in the house was probably gonna have a child we already have three so i informed my wife there was no way i was staying in the house that night
so
oh honestly say it's enough
yeah yeah we've we've done our part so
ah <unk> <unk> says that he uses <unk> all the time they love it
oh there's a game i always play ah well i played for a week and then i i get too obsessed with it and have to back off for a bit
and it's called geo <unk>
and its google maps but you can pick like either the european union or the united states canada there's tons of maps are already made
and it drops you off in the middle of nowhere and you have to guess where you are
and you can walk as i was just doing a minute to go through it but you cannot zoom out enough to see which country you're into you could always see where you're at
that's really cool like i love doing the europe one cause you gotta guess by the language on the signs ah trucks passing
and then you you ah the points are determined you start off with <unk>
and they start <unk> for a point i believe or two for every <unk> that you're away from the exact point
and it's not like you can just pick the country you got a pick the area where you're into for anybody who loves google maps it it really makes it a lot <unk>
something to look into ah and this is where i'm from ah well
here's montreal here and i'm from what they call the gas bay and this is like that thumb that sticks out from quebec <unk> in new brunswick and of course maine in the lower side
and ah above it is the where the saint lawrence <unk> comes in into the great lakes
ah i got it i got it oh you went up to do plus oh you okay okay i see what happen you went to add probably cause the mic is right beside it
oh
yeah then it'll turn red
yeah did you guys did you guys hear us before that
yeah because they're commenting
oh okay well then okay i <unk> guilty as charged then okay
ah just gonna show one more
okay do you hear us now can somebody just loud and clear perfect thank you <unk>
thank you so much you're a great team player we love it
yeah <unk> says that gas bay is a nice spot actually originally he is from new brunswick
yeah oh it was new brunswick okay then to p e i what part of new brunswick were you originally from
ah yeah to drop a message j j ah thank you so much for coming in ah thank you
nice to see you ah anybody want to go and listen some great songs on uber drive
yes
go over to j j karaoke ride share driver it's amazing ah you have never had a ride on a on a uber like that before you gotta go and check it out
most definitely as very entertaining the people are great sports that she picks up i think it's one of you favorite channels i've say
oh yes yes my god i sing along i i literally sing along
this is true she is not making this up i heard her so i can vouch for that
yeah that's true <unk> is from <unk>
oh <unk> ah when we travel home we always go by new brunswick that's why i was curious we always go by <unk>
along the <unk> and then into which is it number two i believe it is if i'm not mistaken ah so amazing to have you here that is great
ah
one of the big land ah on of the big attractions on the gas bay because it is all small towns ah it's all coastal fishing communities mostly
this is one of the most famous of the places and this usually represents the province of quebec a lot of times
when they do ah ah different visuals from all the provinces and it's called <unk> rock
and it's just a rock that literally was they figured moved about eighty kilometers during the ice age you can see in proportion to the buildings here
and it's one of the most beautifully beautiful places and its heavily photo ah photographed
ah ancient you feel like you've just traveled back in time every time you see it it it's incredible
just looking and see there is any other really great pictures of it
which there is a small ferry that ah the ferry ah tourist boats that drive right through the hole
ah and the pieces beside her was once connected but overtime has fallen apart and eventually that's what will happen of course to the other one as well
there is a huge bird sanctuary there you can just see the corner of it right here called ah <unk> island
and it's ah monitored by i believe it's <unk> university from montreal
ah another perspective of it from the backside just to show you the size of it it's colossal
but it is definitely ah a place that if you're ever looking for somewhere off the beaten path
it's friendly it's all that you can do the coast about you can easily do it in a day but you'll drive yourself crazy
to really visit it you give yourself three or four days you know to see varied
varied terrain it's almost like traveling through three different countries i would say almost i would
yes
you know cause they don't have any in common the north side has some of the oldest rocks in the world black worn down
ah but an amazing feeling as the saint lawrence <unk> comes in on the lower side here is a lot more closer to red rock that you would find for instance price edward island
but not as red as theirs so that's <unk>
and then where i've lived for instance as we come to the park following that river which is nothing but trees and some of the highest mountains in quebec
which course of are ah all part of the <unk> that run all the way down to the south of the united states
we're all connected yeah so there's just some of the photos from it there's some from the island of the bird sanctuary
ah can you go check the microphone again please
again
can you just go check
yeah i hope it's good this time
okay ah just a second um just hang on ah railroad man says he is on and let's try to connect him
oh there he is okay already
let's see here
bear with us
showing broadcast let's try this
make sure the stream is muted yes it is hi
hello
how are you
i am ah doing well
thank you and thank you for your patience
it's alright so i am accidentally
kill your stream i did not intend to do that okay that was purely by mistake
this is incredible and this is the first time i've ever done this this is truly incredible
thank you thank you ah that's a honor though yeah be patient with us we are not really sure still what we're doing
ah i'm the same i'm the same
i'm not that good with tech either
as my grandmother who has been to london once said technology is great when it works but it's a real pain in the neck when it doesn't
that's true
words to live by words to live by
yes sir
so you are just on a vacation you were just on a trip right
yes ah my most recent trip my first my most recent major one was to ah the <unk> recently
it was princess <unk> and <unk> that's the two places we stopped at
that's great and how long were you there for
i think we were there for i think a few days i can't remember most of the time i was on the boat
also i am currently doing a live stream on my phone i sent a video link to it and i have to look
let me go to your channel and ah just to go in and look oh that's cool i see myself on your stream
i like that i like that
this is if i was in control almost
so how how things go with the channel your channel
well we literally hit <unk> subscribers only a few minutes ago
excellent
amazing
that's amazing great good for you
yeah yeah the video link that i send is your video back by popular demand
whose is this studio livestream sorry if i said the name wrong now the town is what i know you guys were talking about it but um
exactly what country is it in i'm sure i'm guessing a europe correct
yes that's correct it's in <unk>
ah
yeah and <unk> is a ah coastal country for the baltic sea right across from sweden
ah
yeah well roughly across from sweden i guess bit an angle but yeah you go through poland and then to <unk> and then to <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and estonia is referred to as the baltic states
ah i've heard of all that yes
so yeah
i must say for a person has been through europe what did did you say was twelve countries in fifteen days or was it fifteen countries in twelve days
so ah twelve in fifteen yeah
ah that's amazing and i have keep it in mind i have never been to europe
but my grandmother she's been to london she's been to france she's been to italy she went to florence where the renaissance began
wow
amazing
yeah my grandmother is a retired school teacher and she has been travelling for most of her life since retiring i only started traveling with her in <unk>
okay that's good though got you getting out doing stuff like that maybe some time for a trip to europe for you both
well i'm we're waiting for no offence the madness that was going on recently over there to calm down
definitely no that makes sense ah we haven't been over in what's it two years almost three years
ah yeah this summer it's gonna be three years ah we haven't been there but
it's a longtime feels like because we were travelling there every year almost and then and then ah kinda paused for a bit but
ah which country would you like to visit there
well frankly i'd love to visit either italy
or greece because both have a rich history
yes
i'd like to go to florence because i mean in my history class ah that was of course where the renaissance began
right
also i must say i love the ah photos you have behind you from europe i would like that i'm into historic architecture that's something i like
oh
this is from my ah well people have seen it from last night but oh i got to clean up my camera
you're not the only one who usually have to do that
stay with us while i clean up the the cameras
i have a camcorder and i have to clean the dust off the lens like regularly
you deserve the clearest picture possible
oh man that's that's beautiful i love that remind me it kind of reminded me of venice almost
i know that's probably not not actually venice but it looks similar when you think about it
there so other people can see too
oh okay
i can see it clearly
ah actually let me go in your stream because i think what they may be seeing right now is i think a my bedroom at my grandmother's house
oh no never mind it's coming in clean it's coming in clear oh wow now that's showing my face okay um that's a bit of an issue when you think about
ah we were talking from last night though pictures behind me we have a picture from every country that i visited
and ah oh some of us some together and some of my own
but the ones behind me there's the twelve them that was my first ever time i travelled for two weeks mostly by train across europe
wow
what's that
i've never traveled the country by train i've been on plenty of the scenic railroads and what not but i've never been on a legit cross country passenger train run
i've always wanted to do that i know canada has some very beautiful scenery and they still use vintage passenger equipment i think from the <unk> and sixties
ah some of them yeah they they have been a modern modern <unk> thank you
but yeah they do still have some in the engine still running in there and there's also the more where expensive one maybe bottle caps can help you with the name of it
i think it's the canadian i know that one of their trains that still uses the vintage passenger car fleet
yeah that but that's still part of the via rail one but there's another <unk> one that runs from calgary to vancouver
oh wow
and it stops at all the <unk> hotels all the five star hotels every night and
i know the canadian actually um
i know they stopped i think a few at few of the <unk> that were built by the canadian pacific i could be wrong i could be wrong
um um
but yeah i did like i said in the stream chat i've been wanting to try do an interview about my channel for a while now
i actually tried to do to ah self interviews they were i really don't think they were very good in my opinion
this is an honor for me okay keep that in mind
oh my god it's an honor for us to have you here
thanks you
we're still getting our sea legs if you will for this so it's a learning process
this is a good start
well this is this is and there is lots of great people i mean in this community is very supportive and that is what really means a lot ah did you join the i am a <unk> ah i am a creator community
ah no i don't think i did is there a possibility you can could send the link to that in the <unk> chat
ah yeah ah after the stream i will set you up
alright
it's a great place that's where a lot of us that are here met each other i'm looking to the list here and that's a lot of them came from there and it's a great place to network with other people
oh also here i ah i'm gonna send you guys the link to my stream because
i included your channel in the description for the stream right now it's still live for me
okay
and it's at very bottom of the list my apologies sometimes i include channels here or there that even though it's out in the stream i figured it's too good not to include
right
when i saw your winds your video where you film the wind <unk> train i still think it's very well done
thank you
that that's really got me interested in your channel and i must say your work is truly phenomenal and some of the most incredible video work i have seen
oh thank you i appreciate that you're you're too kind
yeah it's ah that train was filmed in the gas bay where i grew up where i showed on the map a while ago
and we are home on vacation and how the train thing started is i've always loved trains but i i wanted something to do with my my middle age
<unk> i have three children we have three children excuse me and my middle one is now eleven he was ten at the time and i just wanted something i could do with him
and i wanted to keep shooting stuff it's hard with video because hard to find things that are interesting sometimes
and that's when i finally decided to try the trains with him so he'd come out with me all the time and
he was a good supporter we all get into it he gets you know he gets to know it's a good way to spend time together
so long story short we are in the gas bay and the nicely thing about that train is that up until a couple years ago it wasn't an active railway via rail wasn't going through there
prior to that was the c n they already <unk> the freight but then there was a problem with one of the <unk> and therefore they shut down all ah passenger
so now you have to go to ah town of new brunswick <unk> ah <unk> in the province new brunswick just to be able to get a passenger train which is an hour away from where i live
ouch
but since they start to build these <unk> they actually have to truck them from the coast about <unk> kilometers to that point then they load them on these train carts
and from there yeah so the maximum they are allowed is <unk> cars because well for canada you're allowed maximum two <unk> rail
because that's the longest ah spur that they have that has to go off the tracks
and ah they <unk> it you can go on their website and it will show you exactly when the <unk> leaving the full schedules
i actually never caught a turbine train before i've never caught one
yeah
i didn't even see though a railroad here in the u s norfolk southern has a program
where they paint some of their locomotives into the railroad paint schemes of rail road that they either merged or just simply no longer exist
right
for one instance when i was an <unk> pennsylvania i actually caught the first as what we railroad friends here call heritage units
yes
and it was the pennsylvania heritage unit
i kinda find that a perfect one to catch because the track you going throughout was formerly was owned and ran by the pennsylvania railroad
ah wow that's interesting
that's very cool yeah you do a lot about digging behind the scene that's what i like about what you do actually
thank you i will tell you i am into trains i've been into them since i was two years old but that's not the only thing that i ah do on my channel
that's this live streaming i only got into recently i actually was only started in on my birthday that's really when i first got started with this
it's truly been getting more of the attention on that channel ever since
i really don't know
it's a great way of ah getting the view time
definitely there's nothing wrong with that i mean ah we all here to grow and and it's nice to new ways it's like
as if a painter started painting and then only did the same type of style the rest of their life
that is true
i actually collaborated with another youtuber before recently his name is ah jesse <unk>
he does he's a good gaming youtuber he ah he does videos on a game called roblox
yes
i don't know if you've heard of it but he and i have done almost <unk> videos together now
wow good
some were what you know teenagers my age call memes i'll admit i'll admit they're hilarious some of them are related to me and
some of them i asked they to make oh my god i have to tell you i find them funny i don't know of any one else would but yeah
i ah i'll send you guys a link to his a channel very quick let me see if i can pull it up here railroad <unk> <unk>
ah see here
our kids actually play ah playing road roblox ah
probably too much
<unk> the problem nowadays people my age and younger are just getting more and more addicted to the games
oh that's okay as long as you have other hobbies like you have this and stuff so
true that's true
it's all about balance
yes that's true and let me see here i know i have a list of channel here let me see here
oh so i want to ask you you did a trip to alaska didn't you
yes that was that trip had a lot of <unk> if you will that was the first time i had been on a jet
first time i've been to seattle washington first time i had been on a cruise ship first time i've been to alaska and general first time i went to canada
first time i've seen a glacier yeah that there was a lot of <unk> and i had actually hoped when i was there i had hoped to see <unk> whales
that would i've made a sort of vowel to only see whales in the wild and i had never never got a chance to see him in alaska never did
oh that's great cause it means you got another reason to go back
true but it was my grandmother who was able to make the trip possible i had waited thirteen years to go to alaska thirteen years
<unk> to <unk> and it was mainly due to a film my grandmother brought back on her trip to alaska back in <unk> <unk>
it was about a railroad that is the in <unk> alaska it's called the white pass and yukon route
okay
and it's been in use since <unk> and it didn't shut down normal revenue service until <unk>
okay and it only stayed closed for five years and a reopened into the current operation it does now which is excursion trains in <unk>
and i after she brought the documentary back in <unk> i ah
let's just say in her own words once i sat down and watched it i never moved i was <unk> by it
and she told me the next time she went back she would take me with her and i waited of course like i said thirteen years
then i finally got to see the railroad for myself and ride it in <unk> and i have plenty of footage of it now
a lot of my film i'm still trying to improve on none of the videos are currently edited i'll admit that ah there's there's a lot of stuff i'm still trying to work on with my channel
um
but i mean i'd kind of like it that my videos aren't edited
because a lot of the time not many youtubers really upload unedited footage anymore and i like to show what normal youtuber is really just decide to leave out that's what i like to do
right well everybody's got a find their own way to express themselves on youtube i agree
talked with bottle caps tonight about that that's exactly what it is everybody's gonna find there own way that they feel comfortable and sending their message
that's true
look at musicians we can take the same song same lyrics and given to twenty different musicians they all gonna come up with a different way of expressing it
same with the music i mean i've always some times i've always said that i feel like i was just born in the wrong time because when you think about it
if you see my videos i mean especially one i did kettle creek battlefield
it s a revolutionary war battlefield seven miles from washington georgia where i live i live in ah athens but you know the battlefield is seven miles from washington but
in the video i make a point to mention that i have a deep respect for war veterans a very deep respect for them
um
<unk> i mean just think about it just what they've gone through alone you know you know they need that only i don't like it when they're forgotten
yeah
and that they deserve to be remembered especially for what all they did
and i have a very deep respect for people who have come before my time
for a lot of the historic you know events that have happened before my time all of that
but what interested me most as you know a lot of things were around before my time you know a lot of <unk> and what not i find that very interesting
how many people in my generation really care about that stuff
not many you're right you're very true
that is true and it's a shame it is so ah its great to have somebody like you that might inspire some them to go and take a second look at it so
train man would like a shout out of course train man you could have a shout out you could join the panel if you like i always love to have you and you don't feel like tonight some other night
ah train man another great channel ah some really great catches definitely check him out
hand on let me go see if i can find him where is train man there he is
train man if you can here me i'm just want you know i'm gonna shout you out on ah my channel
<unk> i am also doing live stream right now by the way train man i just subscribed you now have forty subscribers
you're gonna
and train man like what we're saying a while ago go to the i am a creator list ah definitely
okay let me see here
dad it's your dad hey dad how are you
just i gotta <unk> <unk> i'm so glad to see you here and i was just thinking about you
i am ah i wonder if i can let's see here how this we can do this just ah bear with me for two seconds
<unk> <unk> we have to get you on here bike <unk> actually had an accident and was just gone through some surgery that we haven't seen him in a little bit
so it's extremely nice to see you here i i i hope everything is well we'd love to have you on the show some time on our stream
and if you can just even give a quick update even if you just type it just how you're doing we're all been thinking about you man so good to see you here
tell him that i hope he feels better
oh definitely we all send all the prayers to him just saw your notification and jumped on thank you so much hope you doing well man
he's a brave man and very friendly and a very good outlook for somebody who just had an accident
most people will be quite bitter at the situation he can't wait to get back on the road again
and not in a bitter way either actually just wants to enjoy it again so hats off to your body
thank you we have twelve watching now ah quite a steady stream
yes definitely
that's nice to see
ah to start p t middle of next month p t must be ah building back i guess
ah yeah i guess
i feel like such an idiot cause i probably should know the <unk> right away just want you to be feeling better man whatever it takes to get back you do it
<unk> therapy
<unk> therapy
don't mind us it's saturday
yeah well it's amazing that's the problem with stream
it's when you have these things like brain <unk> stuff like that cause everybody is looking at you
hey don't feel too bad man i am the same way i had a bit i had a few brain freezes myself in my stream so i'm like what what was i just saying you know
that happened to me on so many occasions i swear
oh god well that's part of the fun
imaging try to stream for three hours straight and just
you just talk about anything that comes to mind that's what i've done okay i've stream for three hours nonstop and i just talk about whatever came to mind
whenever i do these <unk> i can never stay and talk about one specific topic
i mean it just it's sort of random when you think about it really
um that's ah that's keeps wheel turning
see we are on the double we are in our stream and in rail <unk> stream as well
ha nice
stream sub stream that's what i call that
yeah that's a good term
that's right contagious in a good way we're growing
i tell you ah my parents have actually told me i ma pretty one whose unforgettable and i think they're right
i recently went to a rail line in west virginia it's called the <unk> scenic railroad which is really worth checking out by the way
and i actually befriended one of the guys who works on the train his name is josh and when i met him for the first time he was actually a commentator slash <unk>
and i did afterwards i ended up leaving <unk> to go back to georgia once our trip there ended and
i didn't go back for two years and when i recently made a return trip which is heavily documented on my channel
i ah now was also on the same trip where went to niagara falls okay in ontario canada
i you know saw him i said hey man you remember me and it was like
he remembered me after two years of not seeing me he remembered who i was as
that's amazing
that it was the same with my mom my dad's mother too when she went i think it was either hong kong or beijing she went there like three times
there was a street vendor who remembered her and she hasn't even been been back i think three years at one point
wow yeah well some people are just more memorable sounds like you
i think it depend on their character
you stand out so that's you want to do in life that's what you need for youtube so that's all good traits so
i mean there is few reasons i made the channel one the first reason originally was i want i made it
you know in <unk> but this was when i had just started getting into filming and ah at this point i had a computer
that you know really didn't work too well and it always had a hard drive crash every five or ten sec minutes in a sense
and i lost everything on at the a really sporadic basis and it was annoying okay it was very annoying
and the computer i have now which is a <unk> laptop i had for almost i think two or three years now
it's proven to be a very good computer it's only had one hard drive crash and its not had crash since knock on wood
good yeah knock on wood for sure
but yet when i was uploading my videos or at least try to save them on my computer i was i mean i had already been to youtube i've been into youtube for a while now
but yeah hold on a second train man i included your channel in the description by the way
yeah i ah made the channel so i would have a place to put my videos in case my computer crashed again i wouldn't lose them
i never really thought any body would view them or watch them i didn't even know if i am get any subscribers
and keep the mind the footage is still there but it's nearly four years old and in my opinion now it's like really bad okay
i've even labeled one of my playlist which is when i filmed in <unk> it's in parentheses
well bad film if you will cause it's can't be watched okay i was really inexperienced when i filmed that let me tell you
well that's we all learn we're start somewhere we look at back our own work but i mean it's all part of the process
and a lot of times is making of a good thing out of something that didn't quite work out the way we're hoping
true
i have a video if you've ever seen it it's called montreal <unk> and the reason why is ah i recorded by accident out of my car
i didn't realize i'd switch to two <unk> frames a second
oh man
so i recorded literally two hours of <unk> and i was like what i do
oh no
yeah so i am looking at all this stuff and i'm like oh it's ruined
imagine if it was like a traffic jam
yeah yeah yeah it was in actually and i covered a good twenty kilometers like what nine miles ten <unk> something like that
wow
so i decided to come and pick it up and i ah took it and turned into a <unk> cop show ah intro which i always love those little shows so
nice
might as well do something with it so
hang on train man is asking me something in my stream train man i'm in currently in athens georgia u s a
and i've been in georgia since ah since my birth
actually you guys i'm just curious if you want to know you know why i named my channel railroad <unk> <unk>
yes
well the railroad part refers to my interest
not just in trains but also in travel and vintage vehicles like planes and cars i have an interest in that
excellent
prefer preserve refers to my interest in and <unk> and
um history
okay
of all areas all <unk> and <unk> is really really refers to the year i was born i was born in <unk> so i was born at the start
kind of figured that one i wasn't a hundred percent but i'm putting money on that one
i mean don't ask oh are going to be ask everyone asked me about the first two parts of the name but the last part is sort of self explanatory when you think about it
i think bottle caps was born in <unk> as well you guys got that in common so
bottle caps says he is too old to chase ah girls now
yeah yeah i don't believe him for a second
i don't have a girlfriend be honest with you as crazy as it sounds i'm seventeen and i don't have a girlfriend
well there's lots of time for that
true
no rush
what girls will be into train you know it
well you never know there is one coming along <unk> has been out with me on some of the trains she is taking some train photos and stuff like that
i wouldn't say she like it most but she has come out with me sometimes
i i won't brag that one out more than i i can so yeah <unk> not like
oh by the way i send my friends jessie <unk> channel in the <unk> chat by the way i meant to tell you that earlier
thank you
yeah ah i ah let me go to my playlist here
i um recently read did a stream where it showed me organize my <unk> playlist
<unk> i had a lot of saved playlist which referred either music or video video <unk> to my interests
okay
i sort organized them there is music from films i remember watching when i was younger up to the present
there the documentaries i found on youtube a sort of an extensive sort archives here are my channel
there is gaming videos and comedy i guess you could see from other youtuber some of which are my favorites
okay
and
it's a great idea to put your videos ah in the playlist it's a great way of showing people what it's about and ah you know let them watch it as well
you can never been enough list even including your own
yes
true
and definitely good for ah for the algorithm as well so
yeah
i mean but the also going back to the reason i made my channel
aside from the ah me making the channel as a ah web place to store my videos
you know i didn't as i said you know i didn't think anyone would even watch the video
i didn't even you know i just already sort of make the assumption you know oh no one probably will like them anyway but
eventually you know people started to take notice it was slow at first but after a few months it hit my channel has gotten to like i think twenty-two subscribers
then it started to drop and i was wondering okay you you know what was i doing wrong okay
if you look at my playlist that i filmed in <unk> take note none of the videos are named
i didn't name i don't think i even named it until like a few weeks back
and i mean i had footage from <unk> ah our drive from north carolina to <unk> west virginia
and keep in mind when i was filming these videos i had a earlier camera it was a i think it was a sony camera
it wasn't a camcorder in fact hang on a minute i have the newest camera used for my trip to alaska right here
see here let me get it out here
this is the this is it this is what i've been using since <unk> and it's proven to be a very good camera
i got it specifically for the trip to alaska
okay
i am telling you that's one of the best cameras i've used i am telling you that's one of the best cameras i've used
well that's the biggest thing is if you're comfortable with that's that's what make everything
i am comfortable with it i can tell you that but the phone i'm using a to livestream is actually one of the newer electronics i've gotten in a while
the phone i used to have was one my dad had and it didn't livestream
even when i recorded with their normal camera when you zoom in on the camera it made everything <unk> oh my god i hated it i was annoyed by that
i couldn't zoom in on any little details i wanted to get
so i used that phone with the camera zoom out most of the time or just barely zoom in but this one
like for instance other than this ah here i mean if you watch the stream camera footage here let me just do this as an example
so you see my phone here right you see it's aiming towards the computer see you yeah watch see
zoom in there look at that it picks up even the computer screen pixel and then i can see the little details in the buildings in the photo behind you
that's amazing what kind of phone is that
it's an verizon l g g five i think it's what it's called
oh
very good phone it's one of the newest phones i had gotten by god it works well only problem with my old phone i can record in sort of that first person camera view there
for almost an hour and three minutes
now with this when i'm only i'm limited to only five minutes so i usually film and multi view
that's how i got a lot of the video in my <unk> trip filmed they were in a multi view function where you saw my face on one side and then you saw what i wanted the viewer to see on the other
a lot of the video are filmed in the <unk> with a steel drummer artist named <unk> he was good with playing music on the steel drums
okay
and i had on hello
you inspired me i never thought to take a picture of what we're doing here
thanks for everything
you two are good to talk to you know that you really are
we're pretty easy going it's all about fun doing this
hey i am having a good time too man
that's great
that's good area of youtube you can all do everyone can come together to have a good time that's the beauty of it
that's what looks like from our side
okay wow that is truly professional i like that i like that
this is as thrown together it can be
hey it's better than the setup i have i have just this one laptop and which this laptop is the only one i have
i don't even have an editing software on it okay
keep that in mind keep that in mind
it's all i don't mean this this topic back and forth
but you know going back to the up channel again i mean i am sorry i don't meant to
yeah the other reason is become one of which is sort of another this other reason has become more recent to me
and that is i have two younger sisters one is named <unk> and the other is named aubrey aubrey is the more recent of the two and um
they came well after me by quite a few years and
then i realized you know i don't know my grandmother would be able to would still be able to travel by the time my sister those two reached my age
i don't even know and i don't mean any offense to her
no no
ah she's in her late sixty and i i don't know if she would be you know still
yeah things can change in a moment you never know
i don't know if she would still be alive when aubrey is my age
yeah
so the reason i want to make my channel now is so those two can see my videos and see the trips that she and i went on together
oh wow
keep in mind i've been traveling with her <unk> i first came on here since <unk>
a lot of those early trips have never been filmed
that i ask recently you know if we had time when we had time available if we could try and revisit some of the places we first traveled to
the first place i ever went to with her was to <unk> georgia now that's near atlanta
and its where two civil war steam locomotives are housed one is named the general the other is named the texas
okay
and if you don't know what the andrews <unk> is i recommend looking it up it's quite unique and is quite interesting as to how it all played out
both locomotives are preserved and i was amazed by how the story about it
um
and it took place during the american civil war
where some union spies tried to take a confederate locomotive to burn railroad bridges along <unk> rail lines
try to stop <unk> supply movements but unfortunately their plan failed and they were eventually captured by the <unk>
all i think all of them received the medal of honor the ones who survived the p o w camp
i think all of them got the ah medal of honor i think they were the first to received it except andrews he was excluded as a civilian unfortunately
but the film has been the even has been you know sort of i guess you can say <unk> thanks to both locomotives being preserved
the general was restored to operating condition in the <unk> during the civil <unk> centennial
right
and eventually found its way to georgia and its been on display in <unk> ever since
texas was on display at the atlanta <unk> until recently when it went to spencer north carolina for cosmetic restoration from what i heard
you have amazing retention ah it's unbelievable memory and and and the way your present yourself it's quite amazing
i try
you definitely doing something right
you're quite smart young man
yes
thank you thank you very much
and i really like what you said about saving it for your ah sisters that really struck a chord i think that's amazing your intentions for doing all of this
and it can happen in a moment's notice
and i think i should know i would i mean i've had to go through two deaths in my family
um
oh
first was my grandmother's mom whom we called <unk> she from what i heard at first
she had passed away in like a hospital but i found out later her ah her house caught on fire due to an electrical fault
oh no
i mean she was i think think she was asleep but from what i was told you know i think she died from smoke <unk>
so the fire didn't get her her bedroom was untouched from what from what i was told she didn't even know anything had happened she'd passed in her sleep
which is good she didn't suffer which is good but i mean it it hit me hard
<unk> i had never not ah once now keep in mind i was only eleven years old when this happened i had never experienced a death in my family before
and let me tell you it i it was unexpected i did not even know until
my grant my mom's dad my mom's mother not my mom's mother blah
my dad's mother whom is the one who i've been telling you about she is the one who is been taking me on those trips until he called my mom and told her
and i mean it it still hurts to for me to think about it
and unfortunately it i mean that wasn't gonna be the last time i short have you know visit from i guess you can see death so to speak
i mean a few years later recently we lost my step father's grandmother who we call grandma sandy
and from what i remember she she um suffered a heart attack now keep in mind <unk> i didn't get a chance to say goodbye to her
but not but sandy oh gosh that was the first funeral i ever attended
and that that was the first time i had ever seen a person i once t saw alive when they were deceased that has never left me
it's quite as something to go through especially when you're a child it's a it's definitely ah leaves a mark for sure
i i can relate so i understand what you're talking about for sure
but i'm great ah grateful for the memories that we have from the people that have passed
an ah i am very happy that you have memories that you're making with your grandma now while traveling
i'm really glad and i mean i'd like i like to spend as much time her as i can and believe me
i mean i have a deep respect for like i said people come before my time she's one of them and she's a very kind lady
she is very wise she is humorous she's actually hosting a party for some friends right out as i'm speaking
your host is distracted if you will
okay oh that's fun
we're going we're actually going to be going on another trip in a few days we're gonna be revisiting a few towns down of southwest georgia
one of them is named a <unk> georgia i have footage of my first trip there on my channel
we are going back because of a few things we weren't able to do that on my first trip there
we were gonna ride an excursion train down there recalled the sam short line they have a website you can probably look it up i think
they weren't running when we were down there before so we're gonna try and go down there so i can film that when the train is running
and we're gonna go to a museum in <unk> georgia which is a replica of a ah historic village
and they have a lot of equipment there that's from i think the <unk> early twentieth century
and it sort of depicts the early life in georgia i think from the <unk> to <unk> and to like i think the early <unk> <unk> i think
i can't remember exactly how far in time it goes but it's really well done the historians are really good at telling the story
and all the buildings i think are original i think there's only a few that have had to be rebuilt
but they are rebuild in such a way they don't look like they're modern they kept they were built toward the original
which is amazing to me i was impressed at how well they kept all the buildings up and a lot of them actually had steam powered equipment
now keep in mind my first trip there none of it was running
this time we had my grandmother has a lot of friends
and i think a friend of hers daughter who is like i think the curator or something is gonna be there
and are hosting a festival there so a lot of their equipment gonna be running so that's gonna be neat for me to check out and i am gonna film it
and i am hoping this sort of play out like my return trip to <unk> where although i didn't get a lot film on the first time i'm hoping to get more done on the second time
okay
that's ah that's amazing that you're travelling all the time
not exactly all the time i do have school in the way though unfortunately
there is that still
that's the grade level i'm in high school right now
don't mind me for just a minute cause we're still now to this i just wanna try the controls here for a minute okay
alright
so i'm gonna try this for a second when i'm gonna first hide broadcast from broadcast and bring you back
so there we go okay so we're good sorry guys we got do this when you're live it's the only way to try it
show in broadcast okay you are back
alright
okay perfect present to everyone
oh okay
well this is interesting ah
i may have accidentally muted the stream for a bit that was
not my intention okay keep that in mind i didn't not meant to do that that was a major fail on my part
oh don't feel bad we've all been there like i said look at us right now we're just
i mean if you watch i ah you could actually see my reaction and i was talking myself about in this live stream when i accidentally did it okay
i ah it was on my face cam though so yeah
<unk> <unk> is ah saying that he is enjoying your historical perspectives
yeah
and he understands your connection to your grandmother and his was born in the <unk> and had great stories
i honestly one of the reasons i have major respect for the people who came before me is because
i really would i really wish someone could go and interview all these people who are around like who are still living from the <unk>
and the <unk>
and you know write their stories down because once that person dies their stories are lost for good and
my step father's grandfather whose name was tom butler he was a world war two veteran
um
and unfortunately i don't think he was ever interviewed so a lot of his stories are only able to be told to my step father's mouth and
my stepmother actually has two japanese rifles that tom butler brought back
yeah try doing that nowadays if you are in service no offense to any war veterans out there no offense
no i know you're saying though i know and they understand that as well i'm sure
but yeah i mean they also put in amazing service and we do thank them very much for their service and anybody who puts their life on the line
but yeah some these guys have seen some very hard conditions ah and not much to work with you know it was very primitive
i just want to show you if you have a second if you like to see it this is <unk> grandfather he was ah a general in the russian air force
oh wow
talk about the russian style
oh that was a failed russian impression just my bad
no it's all good that was him and there as well there
mind if i show this on my stream
yeah go ahead
sure
oh wow and that's a world war one ah <unk> correct me is that world war one
world war two ah world war one yeah for that one yes excuse me that's <unk> here on the left
yeah
oh wow did he ever tell you any stories or your parents stories about him
ah yeah my grandfather he was a scientist and inventor
he mostly like to talk about is the innovations and and and things like that
i think he's seen a lot in world war two that he didn't want to talk about cause probably it was too dramatic
it was like some of those guys in vietnam i mean you know just with those i mean that's like that with every soldier i mean just what those guys went through alone is enough
yes definitely
exactly and ah my grandmother who also lived through the war and actually as in the war time
she was was working in one of the factories putting together guns ah because that's what they were made to do
ah she was telling more stories about it but ah you know
ah like when she when she immigrated so to say or was sent to <unk> where i'm from originally
ah the city was still bombed through and she had to every morning goes through the ruins over a bombed through ah city to get to work
ah so she was telling me more about how it was during and even after the war ended about rations and not having food and living on potatoes all and
my grandfather i think he got what's he's seen the blood of it so to say
so he was less <unk> about the actual war things and more about ah his inventions
and the picture you see up now this is
i heard about <unk> ouch
he's quite a man i never got to meet him unfortunately he was taking early in life but
ouch that's the same with my <unk> grandfather tom he died in <unk> so i never got to meet him
i mean there is one story now that he told my stepfather then my stepfather told me so it's passed down which i am really glad for
now i don't remember how exactly it was i can't now i may not be accurate with me but i think what how it went was you know
tom was assigned to some of the land clearing teams which were to clear out <unk> so
plans could planes not plans blah there's one of those brain <unk> you were talking about i said plans where i meant to say planes
he was clearing out <unk> on one of i guess ah the occupied islands so that our planes could land in and
and out of nowhere a japanese sniper started shooting at him he was using a <unk> that at the time from what i was told
so what he did was to protect himself and shield himself was he raised the bucket of the <unk> up so that the bullet would hit the bucket
and i guess when he found the tree the sniper was in he used the <unk> and <unk> a tree the sniper was in and knocked the tree down
wow
i think what he did then was tied the sniper up and i think that was how he got the rifle that my stepfather now has
i could be wrong on that okay i have to ask my step father for more confirmation on in terms of accuracy but
see that's the thing it's kind like with civil war veterans you know that's what's happening now to a lot of those world war two guys
you know i mean once you know you know cause the civil war once the last veteran died in <unk> you know that story is pretty been pretty much forgotten heck
they hardly even teach me about it my school can you believe it
i learned more about it thanks to a documentary that can but ken burns made about it than what they teach me in school
yeah that's an unfortunate side effect but i believe you on that
yes
by the way getting back to the recording memories so to say or interviews with people that are older
ah i recently got into a thing called story corps i don't know if you have heard about it
ah it's basically a website mostly an app ah where it has either already pre prepared ah questions
or you can make your own and ah make it like ah interview style going through those questions and recorded and saved it on a cloud
and you can either share or leaving privately but that's i find it's a great way of preserving ah things that we were just talking about
what i am doing i am doing it with my son ah some times
so that way of preserving more of the way his ideas ah are changing through the time he is growing up
ah but lots of people are actually using it to talk with the older generations so it's something to look into so called story corps
oh okay i'll look into it also you gonna think i'm crazy but what if i tell you i've actually met in my lifetime three world war two veterans i've actually met three of them
okay
yeah
i met the first one on the plane fly back from seattle it was after our plane touched down in atlanta
and as we were getting off i just happened to glance over and saw his hat and it showed he was a world war two veteran i mean i didn't say anything to him i just saluted him
and he actually turned to me and he smiled and i mean that i was glad i mean i cause i already knew those guys are starting to be forgotten
because you know i think over i think ah over a thousand are dying each day
um
which is unfortunate after that i think the second one i met i met him he was at a home depot
think it was either in commerce or east side of georgia i can't remember exactly where but
i ended up talking to him and he had to show me a picture of the plane he was assigned to
i think it was either a <unk> bomber a <unk> i can't remember exactly
but he and i were talking and i i saluted him i mean anytime i see a war veteran i salute them
and i mean i was deeply impressed by what you know he had gone through i mean
that was sort of an honor for me i had never gotten a chance to talk to another war veteran
and the third one i've met was one who was able to attend our ah veterans day assembly at my school
and i spoke to him and few other war veterans from other wars and i mean he was the oldest one there
i mean that sort of never left me either i mean i really kind of honored that i was able to meet those guys cause i mean they saw what true war was
and unfortunately i mean i know a lot of other veterans and other sides have seen far worse unfortunately which is you know like i says you know
that's what i mean you know just what those guys we went through you know was enough that's what i mean
um
i mean i've actually never met a world war two soldier who's actually been to like say <unk> or
you know the one who the guy some of the guys who actually you know fought back through france
i mean i don't know if they would i don't know if they had been interviewed before or not but still i mean like i said that that has stuck with me
yeah definitely i love their history for sure well thank you very much for all your stories ah it's amazing
you've you've you've at seventeen you lived a whole life already
but you never know i might do a lot more
i've always said you know life is one of the greatest gifts god can give it's up to you know each and every one of us to live our lives as best we can
i mean it's up to us to decide which path to take in life i mean
you can either take the good path make the right choices and make the right decisions you end up living a happy long life
or unfortunately for some they just people they just chose to join the bad take the bad path and take the bad choices and unfortunately they
don't live very long lives and usually ones that they end up either regretting in the end or just not happy with
that's very true sir
but i mean the choice can't be forced i mean it's our choice and choice it's our choice alone

yeah
hello to everybody still at ah is in the chat watching hello hazel and <unk>
hazel and <unk> hello
ah welcome ah i think maybe we can talk a little bit about editing
yeah i know bottle caps ah bottle caps let's start off ah maybe something you want to start off with ah if you can just type up something
ah i'd love to talk about editing and ah same with <unk> with photography want to talk about photoshop premiere
ah different kinds ah not just editing like tips we use when we're out in the field shooting and stuff like that anything like that we're more than happy to discuss
and to hear you guys stuff that you do too i love hearing stuff like that so please feel free the floor is yours
definitely we all use ah some you know special tricks
and and we have some and you guys probably have some too and it's great if we can interchange them and we all can benefit from it after all and ah
we are great community in that way that we share these tricks with each other
so please drop the ah questions if you have or comments about ah editing photo video or the way you're doing your youtube video
yeah
ah and bottle caps please that you had questions about editing we are waiting for them
yeah we're all yours
definitely
ah hazel writes oh lovely couple
thank you hazel thank you so much for coming over it's really great to see you
i think that is gonna be the most ah often question we have to change the pictures every time
yeah yeah exactly we have to rotate cause i know somebody like bottle cap going to say oh they're talking about it again i can hear him right now
this is from the trip ah my <unk> trip i did ah and that's the different countries that i visited when ah i spent two weeks by train in europe
but that one you are asking about particularly that's <unk> <unk>
and what i i was we each have a big picture behind one of the coaches we each pick one of our favorites and <unk> picture was from iceland
and this was mine because i was just find it was one of the most beautiful places ah surprisingly beautiful i didn't think it was it could be that beautiful there so
that's why i picked that one to be the rest are all black and white from the other countries but we did one coloured one each
yeah we talked little bit in beginning of the stream about travelling and places in europe ah
so if you have anything to add to that please welcome and drop a comment
that's amazing so beautiful hazel says yes
ah thank you it it's my go to picture
as i stated i never buy <unk> the only souvenirs actually buy is i buy one fridge magnets at every country
and that actually goes on my mom's fridge cause i've started it as a kind of tradition
and i'm not into souvenirs ah the pictures and the memories are my <unk> so i hold them very closely
so ah every pitch i look around the room kinda tells a story or a moment in time ah from different travels
some with <unk> we had some great adventures
ah our first trip we ever did together was estonia we went to <unk> which was absolutely incredible
and then we took the ferry what's about what it's an hour and a half right i think to <unk> finland
and it was unbelievable it was so amazing there first time
<unk> finland was actually one on my bucket list places i always pick the cold ones which is weird coming from canada but
is it warm this evening in california hazel yeah i was ah so my parting tip always shoot a second take
my second take save me from re shoot last night definitely sure glad i had the footage ho you got that right
ah the video i just did recently ah <unk> <unk> obviously has seen it she brought back the eighties to montreal
there's some <unk> shots of the city my poor son i think he was pulling his hair at one point cause we were literally down there for two hours
and we ended up with over fifty some shots of each section just because it's that time of evening when it's hard to guess what the <unk> gonna be like
what it will look like once you put it through the editing box and like you say that they do get lost so yes definitely always backup everything
<unk> you'll never recreate that moment now maybe you'll go and shoot it even better but most times yeah you'll never recreate that moment so definitely double up
triple up if you can
ah this is the beauty of the digital ah technology is now that we can do that
you know when we were using eight millimeters
yeah
ah our film in the camera for photos ah unfortunately you weren't able to do that and fortunately or unfortunately some may say
ah now you can do as many takes or as many pictures as possible and if you can do it and then you can choose the best one
even forget a photographer just somebody went to a wedding and they are sitting there with a roll of their film in there three or five millimeters we all remember what that was like you know
your waiting and waiting waiting for a perfect shoot cause you only had ah three shoots left on your camera
yeah yeah i like that <unk> <unk> l o l every one is perfect and till you are at post how true is that
how many times you look at the screen and thought yeah that this is this is a killer shot till you get home and that looks absolutely horrible or you lost it that it that's the truth
as many professionals say i think ah to have to do the most preparation before ah shot ah as possible
the most you can do before is better if there is something you can do in post great
but the more you do with the light with composition with the way you're moving your camera that like everything which you can do before it and make sure before we actually shoot if its possible
ah preparation is the key lots of preparation yeah and scouting the place out if i have a new place that i want to shoot i will definitely walk all round it
i'll look for things are gonna look horrible later on in film i've seen myself picking up garbage by a train yard one time literally i picked up probably twenty-five pieces
it was an amazing place to shoot but of course litter was blowing off the highway and yes you might not notice as much we're looking through the camera
but when you get into post like like <unk> says then it really sticks out
and that's an awful thing when you put all two three hours work into something just bring him back and it's all non usable
definitely and i think that is these details that makes a difference as you said picking up the garbage
it's noticing the details that might be distracting in your video or photo ah and getting rid of them
ah making it just a little bit different you know ah those details is what makes the difference
um
when you watch the video or photo
like i don't do much photography as <unk> but when i take photos i kinda do same as i do with video
i ah the windmill train that was brought up a while ago ah that's a great example there's a shoot in the town where i grew up a peak where it's looking the trains is crossing the <unk> bridge
there was lots of open places the shoot it but it was so much more interesting i went down by the bank and you have ah poplar trees they were come off intertwined a bit
i bent back a couple them i try not to break them in half to so when i shot i have some trees in front of it you know some nice little branches
and that's so many people try to go for this like crystal clear <unk> view
but when you shoot like that you have just a couple of branches here and there it gives you that peeping feel that people love like they they found something special
and it really really brings out your shot ah it makes the subject so much more interesting
you gonna remember that the shoot that is taken from standing and eye level is the most common shoot you gonna ever see anywhere
yes
so ah before you're taking a video or a photo think about that
if you're standing and you're doing this probably thousand <unk> <unk> people already did that especially it's summer and the tourist place
so once you do this remember that and try to go either lower or are in a different angle of just just so it's different
because after evenly with the best post edit ah there is gonna to be thousands of pictures of a straight up lake louise straight up ah grand canyon
and all the other places it could ever imagine
definitely
so yes when you think think this move
yes shoot under your leg
even it came on a tiny bit blurry in one corner will give more perspective cause the angle was shot from versus a straight on one that's crystal clear
ah video i almost always shoot ah as my cameras well but i'm almost always shooting at chest level
and that's kinda give a in between view of child and adult ah most animals would see from that perspective
so i think it's the most relatable to most people that are watching your work now is that always the case time will tell but
for me i just found that's kind of what's worked at the best for myself
ah another tips of taking pictures by the way jump to mind because you are saying about the chest level
ah if you want to have a nice and clear picture ah try to hold the camera not in a straight out hands but as close as possible to your body
basically your body is a tripod
yeah definitely for sure
ah lots people do they do this because we can see the back of the screen with the view we want to see what is there right
don't do that that's where you hands start get shaky and
you have no control
oh no control at all the closer you are to your body with that the better the picture nor the video is because it works like a tripod
and yes that is fan boy talk once again we'll bring up peter mckenna he gave a great example for how he was doing the dropping shots
was to put the camera ah strap around your neck hold your camera out so that you do have some support already you know you don't want to far away
adjust your straps which is about here which is usually for most people lifting up their camera you gonna shoot ah just on one foot just off just pivot ahead
and you only have about two three seconds but you could actually catch a lot in that two three seconds
and you got a nice <unk> shots of you wanna like a flower or maybe a small brook somewhere and you want to get that nice <unk> shot is doing that
just let yourself standing on one foot and let yourself just lightly go ahead on your own momentum and you can really get some great shoot
and do that from different angles hold the camera with ah with the slung ah the strap and just turn it slowly
you are not going to be able to keep it forever but you um you'll always know you keep that little bit of steady momentum as you do it and that really helps a lot
ah hazel is asking if we're carrying around charge batteries
definitely all kinds of charged batteries
let me count ah okay so one is always in the camera charged
ah ever every time i come back from somewhere where i had gone to shoot i come back and i charge right away the the batteries
that's just a given so there's always one charged inside and i think i have four or five extra
she's never a shortage of them that's for sure
why because we sometimes shoot weddings and believe me i go through all of them and some times even need to charge extra
and ah that's lithium battery on the sony camera that i'm using
ah so ah that's a lot that's a lot of batteries to go through ah in a eight hour some times
ah but and why by the way because often times as a wedding photographer or event photographer we go to baptism
by the way we will have a shoot on ah on this sunday yes sunday
ah i don't want to lose a shot so i oftentimes just keep ah the shutter open and just wait for the for the right moment
i don't want to lose their motion or their face expression so i just keep it open obviously batteries draining as i am doing that and
that's why i sometimes go through five six of them ah during the event
but yes we definitely always always extra charging batteries even with the phone chargers always with me and we charge ah charges in the car
because i ah you know it's not for being able to talk through it but to to take pictures even with a phone when i don't have my camera with me what about you
ah me i keep five four batteries and mine is a bit tricky for the simple reason that the controller is my cellphone that's how that one is controlled
so i have to keep extra batteries for the cell phone plus extra batteries for the camera itself
ah the four lithium batteries for the camera as soon as one runs out i am literally plug in and charging it
and i will try all day i will planted out so when we do a wedding i'll look around and see the different areas we're going to be filming where the plugins are available and i always try to reserve them in advance
i'll ask the d j or i'll ask <unk> whoever has any control over them that at least saved me one
and from there i am just plugging in <unk> i'd never take a chance i i should get more batteries really
ah four seems to work okay cause i've always been lucky to plug them in but at some point up my <unk> gonna run out
and it does you never know when magic went remember we had a wedding one time well the one with jeffrey in them
yeah
and i thought they were pretty much done with us and then all of a sudden they decided this ah mother-in-law was giving them this gift and they want it on film
and just by the grace of god i had enough battery left in the last of battery to get the shot
maybe not as many as i would like to but at least we got it covered
things creep on you really quickly you got to be prepared for everything and batteries is the key
batteries and s d cards
<unk> s d card can crap out on you at any time you can shoot a lot more footage than you've ever expecting to shoot
that's two things we always keep a lot of i actually keep mine in my glasses case ah not for these glasses the ones i had before
the snap close type that come with them that we usually never use well that one and that's where i keep all my s d cards and i keep all my little bits that i need for that kind of stuff
ah bottle cap is asking ah
okay you ah okay you have watched a variety of my videos now i want you to tell me what i'm doing wrong
and that's a thing i think we're all asking each other i know it sounds sound kind of a generic answer
i don't think you're doing anything wrong ah like i say ah were not the <unk> either we're still learning and i mean we got these really great <unk> and i appreciate it
a lot of it been the marketing our site that really is just getting people to watch it ah that's been the biggest part of all for growing
ah you got you got interesting content i don't see why people wouldn't be interested in to it ah it depends what you want to edit like i mean
if you're gonna go more into what what i do it does it is more of a learning curve than others people that are light years ahead of me
but it is a lot more work and so it takes you know and you need to make sure you have decent computer for it
it's a lot a lot and the same with <unk> in photography a lot of youtube tutorials tutorials
i'm constantly on it trying either to learn when i need i'll think okay well i want this to flash and turn and do whatever
i am on youtube looking for somebody has done it already or something at least close enough
and also watching my spare time to always look to see what somebody else is doing
ah and it's an art in itself editing you know there is people who edit who are horrible at taking video
and that's what's tricky about what we all do here and we got to remember that we have people here who love working with wood
but now all of the sudden they have to learn how to be video of a photographers they have to learn how to be editors they gotta learn how to read analytics in the youtube
we wear so many hats now
and ah we all wished kind sometimes we have somebody myself taking video with my camera i do enjoy it now more
it's more suited to the way i like to take i like to do my <unk>
but i'd be more than happy if somebody was shooting the stuff here like we can hire somebody doing that and i was sitting here just editing cause that's where i feel the most creative
now somebody is the exact opposite they'll shoot for days they have such an amazing eye and they would rather cut off their own arm than have to do any video editing
or marketing on youtube it it's a whole package you see what i'm
hazel we are not experts
yeah you're too kind
yeah we're we're just try to help each other the same as we learn from other people what we are doing you know if anybody have question doesn't mean we have the perfect answer ah i won't call us experts ah
and if you have something that you can do that we've forgotten or know more about please i'm all ears we would love that the whole point is for us to learn as well
i asked a question but never got back to me is there some kind of lag in the chat system
ah i would say so usually there is at any given time
yeah i think we answered all the questions by the way i want to address are your channel in general and please don't start
i wanted to tell you just one thing and and i know you don't want to hear about marketing you know how i remembered your channel
i remembered your channel and out of all of the thousands that we watched it's hard sometimes to remember which is which then you've gotta go back again and again
but what really strike a stroke a chord is a thumbnail of your video of <unk> bay
with a bird i saw the shot itself as photographer first of all i thought it was amazing
like i'm like i remember andrew was showing me ah your channel oh my god look at that i like i i couldn't believe the shots
but what i'm saying that i'm looking at all your videos altogether it jumps out that thumbnail is just like oh my god i want to see what's there
yeah
and i think you should have that as an example to the rest of your videos have your <unk> like that
you have your ah your channels name on them which is great
but these capturing <unk> like you haven't these <unk> bay ah video thumbnail do them ah like that on the rest of your videos
it it's amazing i'm telling you as a professional photographer i couldn't i couldn't believe my eyes like i needed to see that close and and that's how i remembered it
and that's why i was coming back and watching other videos because of that and thumbnail
yeah <unk> are so important and we all kinda make that mistake there i've been there many times
the <unk> that you see for our videos i've <unk> i think it's for times now to get them where i want to get them
and some things i've learned like ah one of my favorite ones is the one of latest ones we did was the train in the fog in <unk> ontario
before i would have taken a screen shot it would've been further back
yes you can see the train yes you could probably guessed there was a bit fog in there
but now if you look at it
because the thumbnail smaller i added i take the shot bringing into photoshop the first thing i do is i up the contrast a lot
because it's smaller i really wanted the punch then i bring up the blacks so the shadows i still want you to see detail
but i want to get to the exact point the sweetest spot where it's as jet black as can be while you can still make out what's in there
and then ah the fog was actually my god i feel like it's a drinking games so <unk> gonna bring up peter mckenna one more time
but talk about getting ideas we were watching and he was shown about how to do ah motion blur to give your picture more depth
and that i've done that before but i hadn't done so long and i've seen it and two days while i was working thumbnail i thought that's it that's what i'm missing
so i took the shot then layered on top of each other and then i added the motion blur to it
and started as a layer mask cleaning it out and gave it that mask with a train comes punching through the fog
because people aren't gonna see the big picture that you're working on to at the time
like you see on the screen they're literally seeing this at the best of times
so hi res very very high contrast pictures is what works great
and that picture like <unk> said that was the <unk> that you nailed it there really nail that and use that as your example and go back and do your <unk>
um i notice your bottle cap logo i like it it's very punchy
i would almost though consider maybe finding the spot that you like to use and use it at the same place on all your photos
like if you notice ours has <unk> studio with the white band across the bottom and usually the four k on top
except for a few of them where i did a photo series or that the hour long train i couldn't make it into four k it was too long
and all it is is one photoshop document i back up of course
but with every layer is all of them photo those <unk>
and i always just go in and add a new layer or a new folder in there and work on that
so everything always stays in the same uniform scale every time
so the four k logo is always the same place the banner is always in the same place and the only thing that changes is the layers behind it
maybe you can share ah one of his videos if you really want to hear
yeah
well we gonna ask him first to see if he minds bottle caps ah would you mind if we opened up one of your videos to look at
it's up to you you don't have to we understand completely if you liked to or not and if there's a certain video you'd like of us to look at just let us know
i definitely wouldn't do that without your permission
hazel also agrees with us that at the thumbnail with the birds that really jumps and adds the strength exactly
as i said that's how i remember your channel bottle caps
you're saying that you you have a huge photograph hanging on the wall of a bald headed eagle
bringing a gift to the drone thousand feet up a dead duck in it oh my god i would love to see that
and that's amazing this is what people want push up put it on
you were saying ah other day your videos are always for local people
no we are interested as i said we don't live there i'm interested in your video
exactly we are all local i mean ah our work is mostly based in montreal
in the tiny town of two <unk> some in eastern quebec and the people who are commenting i mean just once again the analytic show where there looking from around the world so
you you have some great views then you
um
sure i don't sure i don't care bottle cap you are amazing
okay already
he is amazing i swear to god
yeah use the last ah latest one
yeah okay just give a second to get that up
ah
and again they just suggestions we are not experts
no and we're not <unk> anybody i mean we don't have all the answers i mean i'm sure people looking at ours thinking god what are they doing you know you can't please everybody
carol says that you look like jack nicholson are you talking about my husband does he look like jack nicholson amazing resemblance
let me look
i don't know um maybe so i'm gonna be looking through a different set of eyes now
yeah yeah yeah oh yeah the question is from which movie
bottle caps will definitely be picking something like that so okay so let's see here ah bear with me i want to get it set up
this will be another first
ah applications screen share
okay now we are gonna try the sound i hope this works okay
great shot
great opening shot
that that that opening shot is absolutely ah i don't see any problem with it
ah i loved the movement i love the pause in the beginning the composition of the shot the set up is great
ah i would work a little bit on the <unk>
<unk> color that's why i said shot specifically meaning that they did that the direction you are going into i know <unk> would talk about color
ah as you notice right here in the spot you can see that there is
so you can see the only thing right now is your missing is some definition between your clouds your water and your grass
it's a nice shot and really it's not a ton of ah he doesn't need a rebuilding or anything it's just as just bring up your blacks a bit more
you know from the grass here that ah <unk> grass it would make them more defined that way
me personally i would boost up your blacks a bit and even though it's a nice blue sky i would bring back maybe even a bit of a yellow tint just a tiny bit
just to kind of bring a little little little bit of life into the plants over there or try your greens a bit
but usually yellow gives you a more cinematic look but you don't add too much of it and that's a big key and this is a side note
that happens a lot when people get crazy with the slider they start moving at left right as far as it can go
almost everything you do should be within maybe what ten percent i would say is a good number to keep in mind
<unk> you will distorted so badly in the end they won't even look recognizable anymore
yeah ah yeah my suggestion would be bringing the highlight a little bit down and bringing the shadows a bit up
the trick in getting the detail but not getting your shot too too dark is getting your shadows a little bit up
it's not going to be enough to blow it out completely
but it's gonna give that nice ah detail in the in the darkest parts ah as for example in your trees here
ah that would be more visible
and also ah here maybe the highlights are good i would even say ah they're great
but right here if you would just put the highlights a little bit down
i would be able to see more of the water more of the clouds more of that beautiful beautiful scenery in the background there
ah so yeah so that's what i would say with regards to that and we can play it along again where are we okay
yeah beautiful movement the composition of the shot is amazing
and you see right away hear you're doing what a lot of people are doing online
not to degrade your work saying that you you don't need to feel like you you're a made some serve abomination
look at the pass on the birds you got a little bit contrast those birds will pop right out of the water
you have great shoot here
nice speed not too fast not too slow amazing
here's oh right here here's what i would avoid and this is common with most drone shots everything was flowing i want to put this back
let me see a bit further cause i wanna catch it where it happens and you see the flow you had since you left land
and you went out there beautiful right here where you are starting to turn that's where i would fade out
i would never keep that turn in there and as you turn here once you straightened out and you find your angle that you're going in
that's where i would be bringing the video back in like here like ah let's go back see how you kinda panting up slowly
you could use that as a shot cutting out all the middle between where i had stopped in here
this is nice it's getting
the problem with drones and this has been a big big argument for a while
if you're making a video you just want to show flying a drone in an area leave it it's good
if you want to make it more cinematic think of all the movies you have seen where there has been a lifted camera
they never show all the <unk> cause i mean a drone is not a perfect turn when it does one is very very disjointed
as it's turning it's rising and doesn't quite know where to go and <unk> out
cut out the fat remember i was saying with my camera i never shoot a building i wanted straight on i always start away from it and pan across it
because i'll actually cut out that beginning part where i started and it's a little bit <unk> and wait till the movement is fluid and that's where i'll start my video
and where it's starting to get kind of going the same way the end that's where i'll cut off
ah that's that makes tons and tons and tons a difference in your footage
<unk> you got a great footage right here this turn you can use that and then may be cut it again afterwards
see like this is a beautiful <unk> shots like this you can use
but you got a separate them when it looks like moving off and the drone is <unk> itself cut it out
and maybe you'll have to skip five seconds but at least you'll have good footage and then you can show it here
so starting with that i would do the first turn and then see that there was bit of <unk> and another nice turn but almost the same level
i would actually take that next i cut out the bad part and the next one i would zoom in may be
or zoom out as well ah twenty per cent so it doesn't look like the same kind cause it looks like a jump shot with the same ah view
so bringing in a bit more or bringing out a bit more
yeah you definitely in detail and color ah look at all that color in the water like i i just wanna punch in it
yeah yeah
got blue and green will bring so much life in it right away
also all the details in the woods there just they are just screaming to get out
yeah no
you would be able to see so much also underneath the water ah that the bed ah water bed
ah if you will go down in a highlights right here in the shot you would be able to see much more of the things under the water
yeah okay see where the camera got <unk> right here that's where i would have cut that part out and then maybe start here if you have enough distance and the stays smooth
cut out all your <unk> parts and then you have them on the time line and from there you have all your good cuts figure how you work them into the music
music is key you want everything to follow the beat you can zoom in and see every note how goes up and down and you'll see a pattern into it
and from there you can ah really sync up with music and that's the biggest key to building something really great really quick
i'm just gonna put the i wanna try something here control this is not the best way to do it but we're going to try it control ah
ah
i don't know if this will work but you know what we're going to try something here tonight we're gonna try something new
you can still see the chat right honey
yeah
okay
now is is not the <unk> version of what you did i just took a screen a screen capture
so we gonna try this so bear with us
there is your shot
now control f see i am just try this is what we're doing this is unfortunate cause of the picture obviously i am going to try all those levels just for the fun of it
so i'm just gonna yeah i'm just gonna bring up the color gonna bring up the saturation a little bit
you guys see that
i can't see it here
you can't see it
no
can you see anything on your stream
i tried photoshop today it was working
i think it's just because the bandwidth we tried it today it quickly i tried to quickly and it was working i wanna try once more let's just ah
we're just gonna to try it one more time and see cause this is hard to do and i've been reading a lot of people
that's why i want to go to the other programs soon ah just haven't a chance to set it up yet and they will be there
let's see if that is where i get it showing up on here
yeah okay
there so honey did you want cause you are the color person here do you want to just
ah i'll just show the easy way ah of doing it it doesn't really need ah a lot of anything
not making much of a difference that is why i'm just going to bring up the bottom levels a little bit
look how already the blacks coming out through the back um i am just playing with <unk> a little bit we'll just pull them back
ah maybe ah i will do a separate live where i can go through with the tutorial of how to get your ah picture <unk>
yeah
ah we can do a shot review one day
you see you've putting all of the <unk> black but if you just raise the saturation a little bit you know you colors are already coming back the the lights
you're already getting more mood now remember like i say this is a low res version because i took a screenshot so it is quite hard to work with
but it doesn't take much it it it really ah it's it's just paying with it you know
but already your trees are coming out more i should have made a copy of it but let's see here
there's the beginning
and there is the end and you can see already the building coming out more and stuff like that and like i say this is just a very very fast edit on the fly
right and and ah like i said the composition of the flow of the video is amazing but
ah if you toggle between ah before and after you can see how much <unk> the
it it just grabs the eye more so bottle caps you're talking the other day about the viewer attention and that you need more hours and then people subscribe and leave
but these are the things that keep them staying
this is what keeps them watching your video to the end this is what keeps them not just subscribing but watching this video and going to next one and next one and next one
because your videos are amazing i love drone shots who doesn't my god and and your movement of it is amazing too
all the elements are there and like i said once again it's about your editing best way to make it easier for yourself lay all your files out in your editor
cut out all the bad parts right away what you don't need what's looks bad if you have twenty seconds and five of it is <unk> cut out the <unk> and start from there
and see what you can put together
of course bottle caps you were say that you were just ah taking the s d card basically and putting into the computer and and uploading
it it's a great way of doing it
but if you want those viewing hours that these little details that count a lot and would make a world of difference
just even at ten minute work on your video would would make a difference i promise you i promise you start now
i can see it because you have everything else already working for you ten minutes and it's gonna be so much worth it
try it for your next video and then get back to us and and see how it went okay
i see lots of people have ah drones here ah maverick ah as well
i like that you guys are getting in ah matt cook from oregon oh i'm so glad to have you back tonight and yeah i know you were wanting to get more into the details of stuff like that
and and please if you have any questions as well like i said i don't know if we gonna answer them all you do some nice work
but anything ah or any advice for us as well for anybody here to everybody we're just sharing thoughts and stuff like that
that's the nice part about this it's nothing formal
for sure if anybody else who want to jump in and ah having any advice and please
again if ah anybody haven't <unk> yet to bottle caps ah go over ah do that if you like his videos
and please view the videos view the videos they are really really beautiful
oh matt you are too you are too kind thank you so much i mean we're just learning as we go
and literally that's what we are say to bottle caps we just watching every youtube tutorial there is
i know we go on a lot of old peter mckenna yes he is canadians so we are little biased
but what we liked about him and a lot of people say oh well he is just casey <unk> he is not
the thing he's doing that casey didn't do casey was all about flash and i'm not knocking him hey he did great for it
but he doesn't hold a candle in the wind when it comes actual cinematography casey is amazing story teller
they're all great their own rights i'm not turning it into a <unk> contest between them all i'm just saying is for what we do we really appreciate how peter does it
that guy i swear to god could take video blowing his nose and turned into a cinematic event from the tissue to get the garbage you would be hooked on every moment of it
that's a talent
and that's what is is looking through it that's what i try to say about cutting out all the bad <unk> shots
that's what takes somebody imagine of you at a concert hearing your favorite singer of all time which we have and they have an off night
it's they're singing the song and there go in the way it should be and then they hit that one flat note and then they get going again they had one more flat note
well they song the hundreds of notes but it's that flat note that just knock something off <unk> and that's not you being <unk> that the physical element of us
ah yeah exactly ah it's it's the details ah it's the details
we layout a video or i mean or <unk> with the picture
ah when we do a wedding she and i both spend a good couple days
a wedding for <unk> usually involves three to four thousand pictures taken in eight hours that's no joke
so it's a week just weeding out what pictures are horrible right away yeah that's a blurry yeah that shaky some of it you take fifteen of the same shot
yeah i mean any photographer is gonna tell you that combing out the photos after the event is probably the most tedious and of boring task
and i don't wanna do it so bottle caps i don't like combing my photos
but in order to get to the part that i do like doing and to get the end result of the pictures i have to
so i spend hours and hours of combing those thousands and thousands of pictures to get through them and choose the ones at that i am liking and clients are going to like
when we do when we're shooting the wedding the same for me i mean i've seen myself ah
one and a half sometime close to two s d cards full and those are <unk> gig cards so there is a lot of footage to go through
and it's tedious and videos is even worst cause at least with photos you can kind of jump you know with your viewer on the jpeg viewers at least get rid of the bad ones right away
i got to watch these things and four k that suck up so much juice out of a computer just to get in tow minutes down the road just realized horrible the whole thing was
<unk> i've shot thirty the church i've shot at thirty different ways and that angle and fifty ways in this angle
it sometimes takes me a night just to do one building sometimes that's that's the price we pay for trying to get the best shot out of it
and we'll weed through them and i've see myself have to go back and dig through my scraps again because i'm short on time
ah i need to angle or once i got to the editor i'm realizing oh my god that was bad at the end i thought this one was good
so i gotta chop there and then find something else to piece in between or does it's
ah what drives me the craziest is a shot that's one second away from matching with the music
and do i slowed down it's like to look <unk> or do i have to scrap it all and put into shots or find a better shot to fit
it's mixing and matching it's it's like playing <unk> for a couple of days
ah yeah and and of course you know you don't want to go into deep editing of the staff ah if that's not what you will want to do but sometimes just a light touch it's it's great
yes there's a happy medium in all this
i mean in this stuff we are paid for it and then also what we're doing our customer will be watching so we're kind having to keep ourselves in check
ah and we are our own worst critics i mean we constantly like i said the other night telling each other
eighty percent of it is our work and the other twenty percent is telling other one that they are going too far into this you got to just accept it and move on
you know it's like a good ah good bowl of soup just a little bit of salt is gonna make world of a difference
um um and it is the little touches that make watch lots of people who did tutorials and and just look for great ideas
there are so many out there that's what we use all the time and it does make a difference it really does and they're doing a step by step she always got a good reference
well there you go a little bit review i hope it weren't too hard um
